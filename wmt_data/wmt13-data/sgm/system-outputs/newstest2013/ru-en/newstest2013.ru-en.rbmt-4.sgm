<h1>
<seg id="1">The republican strategy of the resistance to the repeated election Obamy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The republicans' leaders justified their policy with the necessity of the fight against the falsifications on elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">However they consider the last one myth in the Center Brennana asserting that the cases of the falsifications are rarer than cases are deaths from the lightning stroke on the elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover the republicans' jurists had only 300 cases of the electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can say one with confidence: these new tendencies will exert the negative influence upon the voters' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense the similar actions partially discredit the system of the American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada the American staff are bearing the responsibility for the organization of the federal elections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="8">Namely therefore the majorities of the governments of the staff are taking on laws, registrations which complicate a process or votes since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon received the new amplitude after the elections in November 2010, which brought the republicans 675 new places in 26 staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">In result only in one 2011 was taken 180 bills that limit right to vote to 41 staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new laws on elections are requiring of the voter to show the identity card with the photograph and proof of the presence of the American nationality.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws reduce the period of the early vote, the voter's registrations are abolishing a right on a day of will and they are taking right to vote from the citizens who have prior conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Up to the elections of 2006 voters were being obliged to show the identity card with the photograph by not a single American staff.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first staff which brought the similar demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the USA confirmed the constitutionality of the law accepted in Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities rushed to extend this practice also to some other staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the two last years they have initiated the bills which are obliged voters to show the identity cards with the photograph, in 34 staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec the American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as the card of the health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, 11% of the American citizens, that is to say 21 million people a million attained the age that is necessary for vote do not have the identity card with the photograph, issued by the governmental organ their staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, five million new voters do not have a similar document in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time a cost of the receipt of the identity card to be demanded often exceeds a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect the young people, the minorities and the people with low level of income.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, less than 35 000 dollars earning 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people, 18% of the citizens do not have in a older way than 65 years and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years the identity card with the photograph being demanded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But these are not yet all of them.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students - voter who are voting for the candidates from the democrats as that is taking into consideration in a few staff are not let use the identity card with the photograph issued by their educational establishment.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the same staff are resolving ones delivered by these clubs for the members of the fishing and hunting clubs who are voting in the main thing behind the republicans to use certificates for the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004 not a single staff demanded proof of the presence of the American nationality for vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">The similar demand was brought in Arizona for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting in 2011 more than ten staff accepted the laws which are requiring of the voters to prove that they are the citizens of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are aimed, evidently, at limiting the emigrants' vote from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is considered that two thirds of the Latin-American voters vote for the benefit of the Democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Moreover, the republican legislators initiated in 2011 the laws which abolish the voters' registration on a day of the vote in eight staff.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also limited the right of the individuals or groups to provide the aid to those who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction was not going on without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the elections of 2004 the campaign for the voters' registration helped to bring in about 10 million citizens into the lists.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time the measures taken starting in 2009 led the new voters to the fall by 17% of the level of the registration in 2010 in comparison with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The republican legislators in addition accepted in five other staff the laws aimed at the reduction of the period of the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the common elections of 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters voted ahead of schedule were Afro-Americans although the last ones were only 13% from the common number of the voters of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="39">The the same came from Latin America also with the emigrants.</seg>
<seg id="40">Introducing only 11% of the voters, they were 24% of the citizens who voted ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to the white ones which were only 46% forming 76% of the voters among the voters ahead of schedule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the legislators democrat and their supporters actively appear against the passage of the laws that limit the voters' registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">The democrat-governors vetirovano a few law drafts.</seg>
<seg id="44">The action of the most ambiguous laws was stopped on the intrusion of the General Public Prosecutor of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This allowed partially limiting the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of 34 staff accepted the laws which are requiring the presentation of the identity card with the photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules which came into the action undoubtedly, will make the carrying out of the voting right difficult on the elections of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The critics from the democrats are condemning the evident direction seeing the prejudice of the laws which were accepted in it on that, in order to influence the election results of 2012 in key staff.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the center Brennana from 2011 shows that the staff which accepted these laws are presenting 171 of 270 necessary voices in vyborqikov board in order to win the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes will have the essential influence on the results of the presidential elections of 2012 at the level of the electoral system.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one is indubitable: these new positions will exert the negative influence upon the voters' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense the similar actions partially discredit the system of the American democracy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Skrining of the cancer of the prostate: to pass a test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As a matter of fact, the test for THE DOG gives sometimes the mistaken, lie-negative, and sometimes also lie-positive, results which lead to the useless medical intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men anyhow that are unwillingly going the clinical observation to eat from what to begin to doubt even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">To pass a test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked for the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the researches conducted in the United States numerous cases of contamination were observed among the groups of those being investigated, to interpret therefore received given in a difficult way and to draw up some precise recommendations in a difficult way.</seg>
<seg id="7">This time, another research, is a European one, discovered a different death rate with those patients who went skrining, and those who did not study it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This research also showed, after the 12-year-old observation, that the probability of appearance is a metastasis 30-40% higher with those who did not go skrining.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40 if one of the direct relatives had the cancer of the prostate gland.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men of the afroamerikanskogo origin are also prone to the increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A taking of the right decision is key moment as soon as the crawfish is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cancer can be both aggressive and be flabby-current.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient should clarify the degree of the risk of his cancer offering him possible versions, without obligatory treatment of the cancer of the prostate gland which has not been presenting danger in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, for the benefit of the active observation of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Currently, many men with whom the crawfish is discovered will not attend the course of treatment since their crawfish is not aggressive and is not presenting threat for life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them an active observation, and if the disease will begin to progress, we will begin the treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We with precision determine the criteria for the decision making more and more about that who owes or does not have to attend the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this way, I would recommend all the same to pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also necessary if to consult importantly with its doctor in order to determine or not to pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the cooperation with the International association of the urology, Movember an instrument that allows appraising all the pros and cons of the passage of dough to THE DOG created.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (still in English, the transfer will be intelligible in the near future) one can download to the address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">You have to avert an illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, wonder does not exist-the prescription in order to avert a crawfish.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the researches, the observance of the healthy way of life remains the better way to reduce the risk of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">He is taking into consideration, what if all lived the people healthy and they moved sufficiently, one would be able to avert 30% of the cases of rako.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoked any more, this number would have reached at the minimum 50%", is emphasizing Andrew Bolje, the press spokesman of the Canadian association of crawfish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, 10% of cases of crawfish are called by some evaluations, by the heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">A few types of crawfish remain absolutely inexplicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian association of crawfish the fight against smoking remains priority, despite the decrease of the quantity of the smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is connected to 85% of the cases of the lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also it is the factor of the risk for many other ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is causing the colossal harm to the people's health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today Quebec contains" 1.5 million "smokers", is saying press spokesman Andrew Bolje.</seg>
<seg id="33">The assuring fact: 10 years after the refusal of smoking the risk to die of a crawfish is diminishing half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to data THE CIRQUE, the excess weight and the adiposity are also contributing to the appearance of disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They are increasing the risk of the beginnings of the cancer of the mamma, the thick and direct gut, the esophagus, the pancreas and the uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">They are adding "The researches show that the regular physical activity has protected from the cancer of the thick gut for the whole life" in Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nourishment</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association is also recommending to limit the consumption of the red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is improving the risks of the beginnings of the cancer of the thick intestines in the oversize numbers.</seg>
<seg id="41">One should also avoid the sausage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat with a way can lead kopcheniya, the drying or salting, to the formation of the carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">They are explaining, "the last ones can cause the harm to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of crawfish", in Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the last years many scientists dealt with the research of the influence of the vitamin additions on the development of crawfish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But at the present time it is impossible to name the results of these researches unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="47">An opinion apiece of SCC, the research of vitamin E gives contradictory results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed the reduction of the risk of the development of the cancer of the prostate gland, other things gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the evaluation of the influence on the development of the crawfish of D vitamin there is also no complete clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However Mr Bolje is emphasizing, that their alarms and the family anamnesis are important to discuss with the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The change of analysis does not lead to a crawfish".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The boson Xiggsa in components</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last summer the message about what the scientists managed to discover the boson Xiggsa, possibly, called the real agiotage - also not without bases.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is considered that this boson is explaining the mass of all the particles in the Universe, neither a lot nor few.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, this the last particle the existence of which was predicted within the framework of Standard model is not ours better, or, at any rate, the "least imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter, is but which earlier managed to discover by way of experiment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics is not convinced yet until the end that the talk is namely about the boson Xiggsa.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without shade of the doubt that we are dealing with the really new particle and that she is strongly reminiscent of the boson Xiggsa predicted Standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, the new ones given, presented are confirming this, apparently, although for the complete confidence some data are not had enough yet this week on one big physical congress in Kyoto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Nevertheless we will present that the talk is about the boson Xiggsa because the chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and we will watch chto zhe this means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Has, in this peace one law is an absolutely inevitable saying that two things can not lie in the same place in the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no possibility it to avoid this rule, do even not try too zealously, otherwise will harm himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the elementary particle physics is quite strange peace, it is turning out that there is one law of the similar character in it also: the principle of the exception Pauli which postulates that two particles are not able to take up the same space at the same instant if they are in "the same quantum state" - this "state" consists is in some common ways, in some their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based on this, physics they are dividing particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find the respectable citizens being called fermions who are sensibly yielding to principle Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">INTO the friend after all bustle about the bosons, the vile gang of the anarchists who do not have the respect for anything - at least to this principle what it means, that they can lie calmly in the same place in the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As the site is announcing (by the way absolutely extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Laboratory Berkli, these bosons are divided, for their part, into two groups: the mesons, about which we will not be here to speak, also "the particles" of the power by means of which the main forces of nature are spreading and to which in some kind the boson Xiggsa belongs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These very bosons, one should emphasize, not all the such exotic essences, as one would be able to think.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a matter of fact if you are managing to read this chronicle this is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: to the photon, or "to the particle of the light which is a "courier" of the electromagnetic power.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed when one particle which has an electric charge is quickening or is changing a direction this "is disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately like stone thrown into the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "violation" the electromagnetic wave is born is (the light, or the infrared emanation, or the ultraviolet, etc.), also this wave is not what other as the photon and, therefore, one of the bosons of "the transmitters of the power".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The the same is occurring also with the boson Xiggsa from that only the difference that in order that this boson appeared another field, the field Xiggsa "should be disturbed".</seg>
<seg id="22">However the field Xiggsa is much, much more stable than electromagnetic field; in order to upset it, it is necessary to attain the high energies very and very, how if speech went about the pond which froze the surface of which only very big stone could have shaken.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the reason a huge accelerator of the particles is necessary as that which is being operated in CERNe is - Big Adronnyij Kollaijder being a ring with the diameter of 27 km! - for the achievement of such huge energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy to electromagnetic field is useful as well for the explanation of the relation between the boson Xiggsa and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a matter of fact, not all the particles and all the materials do not interact with an electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some as for example the magnets, they are interacting, other after all is not no: for example, the refrigerator will never be held itself up by the sheet of paper.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just as, not all the particles are interacting with a field Xiggsa: those which interact have mass while ones other (as the photon, by the way) do not have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Thus, is Mrs Plamondon asking chto zhe these researches "can bring" everything?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science they are being employed for the validation of the Standard Model (SM), allows also this also to feel the divergence among the results of the observations and forecasts the physicists WATCH.</seg>
<seg id="30">Moreover some of them are passionately thirsting so that such a divergence would appear, because the least disparity can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of the Model.</seg>
<seg id="31">Last, it is necessary to say, it has still had essential shortages without offering any explanation for gravity (oij!) or for dark matter which approximately 80% of the Universe (oij-oij!) forms.</seg>
<seg id="32">But they have not found such divergences in CERNe yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">To predict the benefit from these researches for everyday life of the middle-statistical person is more difficult, but would be mistake to suppose that there is it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Look: at the very beginning of the sixties the pioneers of the researches of the laser would be able to suppose even in Bell's laboratories what revolution their work will cause.</seg>
<seg id="36">They anticipated their supplements in science, but at most that.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, already late physicist Uillard Boijl who worked in Bell's Laboratories is a laser where was invented in 1960, and which worked out himself the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, I/you/he said that initially the laser was rather being considered as "laboratory gadzhet".</seg>
<seg id="38">Present...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Also moreover, the supplement can turn up for the equipment which accompanies a research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Uilliard Boijl worked the small sensor of the light out during his optical researches in 1969.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor is serving "as an eye" although this was his initial assignment not at all for all the numerical cameras of the peace now and deserved prize Nobelevskuyu on physics of 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean, that the work will change Big Adronnogo Kollaijdera certainly our life, but, as a matter of fact, this shows that everything can be only.</seg>

<seg id="3">The debates soon have to vozobnovitjsya, and at that time the bill is in the making.</seg>
<seg id="4">That less in this most important field a great deal still does not lie ahead to do.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks in total ago Mr L lived. Else one in his apartment with Monterezhi.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rak of prostate gland destroying it from within granted him grace for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Five years have given to me, I lived for seven", he is saying, among life and death, lying in the bed in the asylum of the palliative departure of Viktor-Gadbua v Beleij, where I/you/he arrived the day before.</seg>

<seg id="11">Working at the table on which an appetizing lunch costs he is giving up itself and is agreeing that they helped it to take the food.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is being stimulated, is even managing to smile, to talk to the unfamiliar people who are working around it, are bringing him medicines, are leading it into the bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage is in front of the normal death.</seg>
<seg id="14">My greatest desire for they to cure me of diarrhea, this wish humiliating" , - he is confessing.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later the personnel found medicine for this disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"For life" they "have been teaching to us:, that the man has to mochitjsya while being", Pierre Broder is saying, the psychologist is in the asylum Viktora-Gadbua.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regress before the child's state unbearable humiliation is for several things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Everything depends from the person's proficiency" to come to terms with a decline, he is reconfirming.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to many people that are dealing with the palliative departure significant events sluchayayutsya also into the very height of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients who are entering the palliative asylum Viktor-Gadbua are always sick with crawfish.</seg>
<seg id="21">They allot them the forecasts at most three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">On this stage, the team of the doctors and the nurses is not granting more the aid, to the "medical" one being called.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Mrs A., 89 years, most of all has been afraid to die "in consciousness of the asthma".</seg>
<seg id="24">But but the illness allowed me to recognize my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children", she is adding.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I do not want anything more in life", she is saying before to allow putting the mask which eases breathing for her.</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been waiting for the last visit of her son who came from Italy as before within the next few days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">They are granting personal hygiene and help on the nourishment in the asylum Viktor-Gadbua with the help of a group of the volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is also a palliative departure which is left behind when is not impossible more nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order you have to make death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec on each 11 700 inhabitants fall one place in the institutions of the palliative help.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is little really, taking into consideration, that sooner or later all of us will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life is going on under better conditions, doctor Kristian Martelj - one of the doctors of the asylum is explaining what are possible.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether comfort is physical, emotional or mental.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we will agree we to grant the oral rinsings of brandy or you pepsi depending that he will ask for.</seg>
<seg id="36">We are not forcing the diabetics to check the level of sugar any more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Also the death is the part of povsednevnosti.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we brought Mr X the beers., which died tonight.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the morning his son drank up this beer in the deceased's feet.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help the kins, in the same way as also the patients": Natali Savar, the director on nursing for the sick, is saying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the asylum Viktor-Gadbua not a single day looks like the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">After next to the 93-year-old old man who is enjoying his last meeting with family in the yard settling on his cushions during toast in his honor, the young man of 36 years surrounded by the parents, the wife and two small children of also pereprobovawiij always so that to survive is tragically dying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Into the last half-year from three to five beds, up to 45 years have always been employed by the cancerous patients at the age", is Dr Kristian Martelj is worriedly speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who are received into the asylum Viktor-Gadbua are arriving from the house, and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of the access to the palliative departure</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is considered that 77% of the Canadians do not have the access to the palliative departure, that is to say to the departure which is being granted so that to ease the sufferings of the patients that included into the final stage of their life simply whether at home, in the hospital or in the asylum.</seg>
<seg id="47">Both some institutions such as the asylum Viktor-Gadbua and the Society of the palliative departure are on the house of Big Montreal, are specializing more or less exceptionally in care of the cancerous patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Namely this big gap in the health services of Quebec forces many medical specialists on the palliative departure to be afraid the passage of the law legalizing euthanasia and help in the suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Starting in October a manifesto signed by the luminaries in the field of the palliative departure, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and Dr Bernarom Lyapuantom and testifying to their disagreement with similar initiative circulates.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to the doctor Kristian Martelj, the health services of Quebec are insufficiently effective to provide the right to palliative departure of quality before will be allowed the transition to the euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, - she is speaking, - I saw the patient who has spent 14 days in the department of the ambulance, in terrible pains, and took necessary measures so that to ease them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that the patients want only to die because they are not receiving the adequate departure.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save the patients, despite pessimistic forecasts, up to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of the survival Ehlen Richard have already been minimum when it stopped the chemotherapy wearing out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After I had informed my oncologist, she answered me that I am stopping a treatment, which is sorry that I am stopping the fight: she is saying.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time she said to me that my days are counted herself!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The all-powerful departure is not here</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr Martelj thinks that 90% of the patients who are asking for death thank medical personnel behind that that they did not fulfill their request, after the team is easing their pain on the palliative departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However it is necessary to note that the palliative departure is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">In words Ehlsi is Monro, directors on the palliative departure in the Society of the palliative departure at home of Big Montreal, the patients are not susceptible to an anesthetization of 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life doctors resort often to palliative sedacii on which the patient is sleeping until the moment of his death, or from time to time or constantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Impossibly more pretend, which we do not know about these sufferings.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patients to whom pain being eased is not possible will be able to have the access to palliative sedacii more and more.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are suffering from pain have always said the same phrase: "I want to die".</seg>
<seg id="65">But certainly this does not mean "I want them to organize me euthanasia" this means "I want to become me it easier".</seg>

<seg id="1">Large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The officials, responsible for the construction of the roads, the building contractors, the installers of the resources of the political parties and the specialists in Italian mafia a day behind a day are telling what they know about the colossal "system" which entangles a building industry, civil servants, the politicians, the union officials and mafiozi.</seg>
<seg id="3">The "industry" which turned out for the taxpayers of Quebec very expensively, in especially 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It "is curious as this system is being strewed after the resources were put to matter all, Jacques Dyuweno is playing around, the deputy and the former boss of the police of Montreal".</seg>
<seg id="5">Namely thanks to it in 2011 the scandal like the secondary result of the investigation into the official crimes connected to the road construction contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of that time from the liberals is burst out, Jean the Ball, I/you/he agreed very unwillingly.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The report Dyuweno" established direct coupling among industry, the secret financing of the political parties and corruption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since a beginning investigations have been in 2010, he is emphasizing, one only Ministry of Transport kept a billion dollars on the contracts", if several things held back their instincts to take the share.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commission Warbonno "has already displaced two mayors", he is adding "the costing ones behind the separate personalities" hoping to "dissect" what will be a success for her "the schemes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The constant subdivision in the fight against corruption created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Constant subdivision created in 2011 in the fight against corruption the ranks of whose a vast staff of the governmental accountants, the investigators and the analysts joined was joined to a matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">AND, moreover, the co-workers of special subdivision "Hammer" who forced "the waste syndicate" of Montreal after 2009 to stop the superelevation of the cost of the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the last weeks the series of searches was made, and the accusations of swindle and corruption were made to some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markottu - mayor of small small town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Zhilj Vaijyankur is on a line, recently the going one is Quebec into retirement from the post of the mayor of Lavalya, the third town according to the size the provinces.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are suspecting it of the repeated receipt of the bribes on the allocation of the state orders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, the official accusation was made to a few engineers of the service of the traffic routes of Montreal and building contractors of the Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso i Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The last one blew up the real bomb after telling to the consequence about the "system" of the receipt of the state contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">For a few years Zambito has given 3% from the cost of the contracts concluded in Montreal certain mediator connected to a mafia who, for its part, "United Montreal" took the money of the party of the mayor Zheraljda Tramble.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2000 Zambito soril to the money to the right and to the left. He transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to the different province parties, mainly the liberals that were at an authority at that time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, he confessed that I/you/he unlawfully gathered the remedies for the prime minister's former deputy for the Liberal party Natali Normando.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The sewer contracts in which set too high the cost</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The "system" of corruption worked in Montreal faultlessly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Zhilj Syurprenan, the former engineer for civil construction, described it in detail in front of commission: all in all in ten years he has received from the building firms of gifts, invitations on the trips, on the tournaments on golf, to the restaurants, on matches on hockey and the bribes of 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewer contracts the value of which he set too high.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials, responsible for the construction of the roads, they confessed, that received on the paw, setting too high the bills by 30-40% with the help of false complements.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then one organizer is from the party of the mayor, Martan Dyumon, accused Mr Tramble of he intentionally shutting his eyes to the existence of parallel budget which filled party funds with dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">After these revelations Mr Tramble went into retirement after dipping Montreal into a deep crisis at the beginning of November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Wantalj Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal driving alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mayor Rivjer-de-Prehri the neighborhood in the east of the island, it is withstanding the sale of municipal area, za bought for 5 million dollars and resold since 2010... 1.6 million the building contractors into the height of the building boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in the election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">She says that in the investigation which will ultimately be begun it will "pull behind the thread allowing understanding the functioning of the system, crawling with the ants in order to stop the gangrene and to determine the culprits".</seg>
<seg id="30">It xarakterezuet this process how "unhealthy, but positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in the course of the cleaning of the wound, but its own investigatory group will be necessary for Montreal and the observer, in order to avoid the return questionable the practical person.</seg>
<seg id="32">How are we tidying up at home.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Dyuweno is noting from its side, that "the officials stole away hundreds of millions of the dollars", but the role of "the elective officials that knew about this scheme", but not participating in artifices worries especially it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Taking into consideration, that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he is playing around: "They told me that this was an only pale reflection of reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec is offering for the parties to limit up to 100 dollar of the donation, but, according to his statement, this will not change the situation: There will be dirty money in a policy, while we will not be limiting the elective expenses strictly.</seg>
<seg id="37">He is demanding the complete reconstruction of the system of the granting of the state contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can not fall more low; it is courageous after it inquiring into the essence of the things, we will be able to build the house on a firmer foundation, with the better control and legitimacy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history also gives up the shade on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyuweno is calling upon those who are laughing to look into his own yard...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSZh is not Barcelona FK"!</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you achieved the extraordinary amplitude in PSZh.</seg>
<seg id="3">How will you explain this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but can - also new measurement PSZh.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I grow up every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical personnel also privnes many things.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors force me to raise the level of my game daily.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also during match this is simpler.</seg>
<seg id="10">In soccer everything is going on very fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not being sparked.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the outset in the center of the preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfontene also before my receipts in Sent-Ehtjen I always took a step ahead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In this way, you are deriving the use from the competition established by Karlo Anchelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The replenishment of this summer will not be able to play novelty matches very high urovnya.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is really important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to such a player thirsting for being at the level and giving his best on maximum as I.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Karlo Anchelotti is showing the support in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Such deputies as Klod Makelele who was playing in the same position help it what and I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Anchelotti the proprietor of the position?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Anchelotti inspires respect in the whole technical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today into the First League for it no the equals and it is ranking among the best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">The vast experience, and it won quite a lot of titles with the clubs of high classes from it.</seg>
<seg id="24">It worked with the great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think, it will bring the new titles to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January an assuring talk was had it and I.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time I left from the whole series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust which it is trusting me is also explaining my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season PSZh?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the First League Lyons took the place of the leader away from us.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we as before readily.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Champions' League is one of our main purposes: we spectacularly qualified into one eighth the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on everything can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want at first to finish with the first in our group, in front of Porto in order to have the opportunity to take on the reciprocal match of final in one eighth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Will PSZh become will be able a first-class European club in short-term perspective?</seg>
<seg id="39">It for this has already had a budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win the titles and to secure the positions on long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today this is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finansovo u PSZh is resources in order to make this project real.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Will not to take the title in the First League as in the past season be big collapse?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this year we heatedly want the real one to secure this champion's title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the past season we were close to this.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, disappointment was because we had everything, in order to come to the finish the first.</seg>
<seg id="48">This was very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, the champion's rank presupposes 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Monpelje, played even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this year, I think, everything will be OK.</seg>
<seg id="53">In spite of the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyons and Bordeaux entered the struggle for title, I think that we have forces so that to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">You do not think, that the mass media are waiting too a great deal from PSZh?</seg>
<seg id="55">This is normal, which they expect from us much, taking into consideration, how many were put and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are completely ready to this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we are winning 4-0 against Trua at home and nevertheless find us, of course, for what we should castigate this some upsets.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are setting ourselves a question, what after all first of all wait from us the people.</seg>
<seg id="59">He will never be able to win every exit with account 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We not Barcelona FK!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to introduce the project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team has been developing with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We proved in the Champions' League that we can answer some modern calls.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester Yunaijted, who has not managed to go into one eighth already two seasons the final, although they also spent the huge money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Taking into consideration the put amounts, we recommended you for 15 points already to a winter break ahead.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyons and Marseille which were not at a height in the past season, "were woken" by this new PSZh.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how much the First League is fascinating.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we will be able to smile and to tell ourselves that as a result, despite all the difficulties, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Apparently, PSZh completely depends on some feats Zlatana Ibragimovicha.</seg>
<seg id="71">Of course and what, if they say that certain "Zlatanozavisimostj" exists.</seg>
<seg id="72">This only means that it is Ibragimovich really successful and that it drives it many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It came for this and it proves that it is the star of First League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere where it was playing it showed that it is a great player and the star of world scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In a group we respect it as the person and as the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">It also respects the people who are surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What it made this is really exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="78">This stimulates also the other ones to improve its game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tjyago Silva who is one of the best advocates in the peace it is also motivating everyone to move ahead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you survive Evro-2012 from national team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">Like disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I heatedly wished to take in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from snatching a little play time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw many things there, and I left from there more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I am managing to play good elimination matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is that what I relied on from the moment of my baptism near the blue ones.</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and must behave in a model way now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months of Didje Dewama at the head of the blue ones?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They are effective for it.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has good positions in elimination group to the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is a severe trainer, it is close to the players and it is inspiring to victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Loran Blan.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blan attained his goal, it qualified us in the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didje Dewam will bring the blue ones into Brasilia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Is deserved good one nobody's (1-1) torn in Spain on 16th October the fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us faith into himself.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this shock there were in Spain, in my career no similar matches.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">You have to pay and you have to sell without help of the banks - with Bitcoin</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The complete contrast the current financial exchange based on centrobankax, the numbered transactions between the receiving sides with c agent fees on their processing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, as that often happens to these technologies, a political sight is evident: the conviction that the present exchange system which consists of bank monopolies is leading by some financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As a matter of fact, Bitcoin invented by Satowi Nakamoto (pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but being converted of dollars, euro...) simultaneously also protected by the minutes of the exchange according to type of BitTorrent who is allowing carrying out the exchange of the files among the participants of one level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 operations had already been registered at a net with 15 000 computers.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few thousand sites take bitkoijny for the carrying out of the donations or as means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course bitkoijna, after reaching the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, I/you/he fell down up to 2 dollars five months later before to return to approximately ten dollars (the courses are indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com) today.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing of the particular one in the comparison to the world exchange of the real money or the financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European central bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report published in October about the virtual currency.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is describing bitkoijn as "the most "successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or a euro" and "similar to the normal currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitkoin is different from the other types of the virtual currencies as "credits" are used for the advancement in video game which zarabatyvayutsya in the course of game or which possible buy (but sometimes also to exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social net Facebook also developed the similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he has always checked the operations of exchange and some central organ is working.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Bitkoijn all the network nodes are simultaneous the holders of the account book, the accountants, the emitters of the currency, also the pokupatelymi sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this net function?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction is going on, like the e-mail, among two users as a matter of fact among two mailing addresses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only for every new payment the user can choose another address providing in this way anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The typesetting of the information which belongs to this transaction is being signed electronically, with the use of the system of the encoding with double key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The net can also check the authenticity of transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check what bitkoijny, used for a transaction, they really exist in the public accounting book distributed according to all the net.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A registration of the new transaction is key stage in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is fitting through the solution to the mathematical task distributed to the computers deciding which like the temporary central bank, receives privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">The talk is about the phase of the randomization of the file, that is the transformation of the big file into digital signature, the short and unique signature.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "are taking" a new transaction and are adding for it the number, before "to xehwirovatj" all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is in finding a number which will give the unique numerical signature (many zeros at beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, they are checking other knots easily, that it is right.</seg>
<seg id="27">Transaction in this way turns out nerarzryvno be connected to the chain of all the other transactions; just any modification will change the numerical signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If with the aim of deceit the user very fast is (less what in ten minutes) I/you/he would have wanted to pay two times one also topic after all the money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the net but another would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer which solved the problem is receiving 50 bitkoijnov.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to avoid the inflation, the reward is regularly divided in half, probably, until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore the number of bitkoijnov is limited to a circulation by 21 million, but they are divisible until one hundred-millionth one, which has still been leaving the reserve...</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of the task also rises with the increase of the computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Life of the net has already survived the take-offs and the falls.</seg>
<seg id="34">The sites that provide the services to Bitcoin were exposed to the attack, also bitkoijny were stolen away from reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used defect is not touching himself on minutes", - Pierre Nuaza who recently threw Paymium is certifying - company carrying out payments by the real money with the use of the net Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">ECB announced also the possibility of the money laundering across this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash also possesses this shortage.</seg>
<seg id="38">The big players such as Wikipedia, they are refusing to take donations like that.</seg>
<seg id="39">Other after all such as blog platform WordPress, they are resolving them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Adi Wamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute Veijcmana are in Israel, they analyzed the accounting book and they discovered that there are not almost 80% of bitkoijnov in the turnover.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Gigantic the sale" were declared in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars are obmeneny", Ijon Xolmkvist working in Coinabul which is dealing with the conversion of bitkoijnov into gold is happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Nuaza, another author of the aid for this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as operating net hard.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of credit card (in the real money) or non-contact payment across the car telephone, but she is using Bitcoin for transaction check, which in this way is coming out more cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="45">The owner is better checking his personal data and in this way can be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is simple in the realization for the businessmen who do not need to install the new devices or the software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It can photograph, it is enough to announce the address only, which and to recognize with the telephone, Pierre Nuaza is specifying certifying that it has already had thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">A common tendency towards the revision of the hierarchical systems exists for the benefit of the more horizontal ones.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before Bitcoin will be asserted, some time will pass, but 2013 become can turning moment", he is predicting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">ECB in his report is intending, by the way, to review the diverse risks which are considered increased today, in the event of the success of this system.</seg>

<seg id="15">At that time Kabul was empty, the country was between some different groupings in the fire and blood due to the fight.</seg>
<seg id="16">The taking by them under the control of the country was being perceived as svoego roda liberation, return to security at that time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghan women paid for these peasants' mrakobesie which Al-Qaeda surpassed them in, but their position did not improve also during our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">The former Mujahedins, the Afghan government and the present Taliban are agreeing about their wish to retain women in a subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main personages of the anti--Soviet war returned to an authority in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They turned into the businessmen who are capturing state earth using the huge American contracts of the subcontract in order to resell them under the building to the repatriates who returned from Iran and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited; majority is of them, is appropriate, did not fight even himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people want the government which would consist not of the thieves as I was hearing in the country side.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave as those will leave who could with American generosity: the outflow of the capitals is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The young people got tired of war and her ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They lived in a modern peace during the banishment in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of population are at the age up to 25 years; Kabul contains 5 million inhabitants, one fifth common population now.</seg>
<seg id="27">Simply the state schools in the towns are filled in as the boys, the girls.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is necessary to provide these young people who will not want to return neither to mrakobesiyu of the old parties, nor to some leaders' corruption with the jobs.</seg>
<seg id="29">All, including the armed guerillas, car telephones, a television and Turkish soap operas which introduce a modern peace, and which look everywhere like.</seg>

<seg id="31">Will the authorities which will command it be considered legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">The old commanders who carried out the anti--Soviet fight have already taken measures to the reconstruction of the provincial squads which would not yield to central authority.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, the mountainous country, with strong local distinctions, is decentralized one has to be before a certain degree, on the model of the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into the centralized state with strong presidential authority eliminating the prime minister's post which has existed since the times of the Constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzaij does not want foreign control, in particular before the elections planned for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country, starting in the fifties, and even earlier, it depends on a foreign help.</seg>
<seg id="36">The industry was not helped to the feet, not a single dam functions, there is repaired not a single irrigation system.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is being imported; nothing is not being caused, besides the vegetables and the fruits.</seg>
<seg id="38">Priority is given to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the country destroyed by thirty years of war the state control of infrastructure would be necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The rumors that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral fortunes circulated.</seg>
<seg id="41">This strengthened sensation only, that the western countries attended there in order to take possession of them only.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is no loot of the mineral resources without energy for the processing of the iron ore or copper on the spot, without resources of transportation in order to export them across the mountains.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have almost already abandoned the deposit of the copper Mes Aijnak after leaving the international archeologists (the World Bank to be financed) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the biggest employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is necessary also that on one beautiful day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan which in a big degree an import and an export depend on restored the normal relationships.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The withdrawal of the French combat subdivisions was ended on 20th November.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009 in the efforts "to conquer the hearts and minds" also to fulfill the impossible task of the combination of the help with the offensive operations, the service of "the soldier-civil activity" attached to Ministry of Defense (Cimic) abolished in 2012, together with small French public organization contributed to numerous public relations and the activity directed towards the reinstatement of the agriculture in dozens of the mountainous settlements.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The difficult deliveries of the Constitution of Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a new risky step of Mohammed Mursi president.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than some day, on the question about the constitutional declaration which temporarily gives him emergency powers he decided to play recklessly.</seg>
<seg id="4">After finding everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutive meeting will vote on the final text for a next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">The head of the state has granted two additional months to the Meeting in order to finish the work a week ago exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon two years are narrower as Egypt is relying on the preliminary text which repeatedly the corrections were entered in which is weakening institution stability and which it is leading to some legal contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only strengthened the separation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the President is persisting I am "strolling" in my "autocratic continuing "to break a present word and to violate a right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In his followers' camp are convinced that this is a way to finish with an institution and political crisis after quickening the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be conducted in fifteen days.</seg>
<seg id="11">The short time period which a text forces the Brothers to refuse the intention to explain to the Egyptians is an article really behind the article.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is for the president also the way to restore the public and democratic legitimacy while dissatisfaction rages on the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apparently, Mohammed Morsi is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively as he declared a Half to the American weekly in one interview.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially as the appeal to the quickened vote is walking to an ultimatum Egyptian people: "Either you are voting for my text or I am leaving to myself the emergency powers" which as supposes the Constitutions have to be ended after the acceptance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constitutive meeting, mainly the Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals did not respond to a call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, shortly before constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling not in the state to bring its opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of the advocates of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">That the necessary quorum was attained, 11 people, spare participants, were added hurriedly yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several things are really close to the Moslem-Brothers.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is natural that in the majority of cases the articles are progolosovany unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">By the way, that fact that one of few differences of the day arose all around pozabavil the commentators... the time for the prayer, in so far as some members of the committee considered that the hours of the Constitutive meeting were incited wrongly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text which yesterday already the vote went as for consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of the common attention, article 2 ultimately remained the identical article from the Constitution 1971 that say that "the principles of shariah are the main source of the right".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafistskie parties for which the introduction of the Islamic right is one of the main demands hoped to replace "principles" on "some rules", which would have given the chance of their stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists that fact that this article was not changed is an evidence of their good will and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", liberals who see only piar in this are answering.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their opinion, islamizaciya of Constitution occurs through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are pointing out in particular article 220, which grants the university Alj-Azxar consultative role, in particular, in that, as for the check of the correspondence of the laws with shariah.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sofi Pomje, this causes alarm, because "the people called upon to make the decisions are not elected and they do not have any democratic legitimacy".</seg>
<seg id="31">We can watch the generation of the theocracy".</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, many liberals are worried by the fact, that the following rector of this university, similarly, will be where less moderate than the present one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At a present moment" it "no not no a concrete religious intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.</seg>
<seg id="35">The majority of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulemy, but the people with university education, some people were learning in a French system": Aleksis Bloe is calming down who is preparing the dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he recognizes that "around article 220 ambiguity can arise because the terms which were being used for it are taken over from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This belongs in particular to "fikx" [Islamic jurisprudence, - prim of editorial office].</seg>
<seg id="38">Also in future the question how much the civil judges are competent to pronounce the judgements about this can arise".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Apart from its religious aspect, the text taken yesterday is exposed to the critique in so far as it is giving a wide power to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The brothers Moslem are reconfirming, that they decreased considerably in comparison with what were on an old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial moment: a power of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with wishes it will go the soldiers, the examination of defense budget not in the Parliament, but in the National counsel of the defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also trial against the civilians in courts martial, despite the requests of the associations on the defense of the human rights will not be prohibited from.</seg>
<seg id="44">The last ones also expressed the uneasiness concerning the text which they consider to be ruinous to freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">The responsibility for blasphemy is kept, and from now on insult is prohibited, which can have the serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, no one of the articles is talking about the woman's defense any more, is emphasizing Xeba Moraef, of Xjyuman Raijts Votch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her statement, a ban of tortures yavlyaet with the only positive moment in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word which did not appear in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president had to appear on a television yesterday evening, the demonstrations are planned today in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The head's of the state supporters will go the outsides, for their part, on Saturday.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the deputies and the human rights activists are arguing, that the law on obligatory linguistic test will give, in the country the swindlers that are dealing in the "linden" certificates have already appeared</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Annually to Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other towns of Russia come 13 million gastarbaijterov.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mainly these are the citizens of Middle Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn the money for the maintenance of the families which stayed in the home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since the 1st December a law according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to take the examination for the knowledge of Russian came into effect.</seg>
<seg id="7">This rule has worked only for those who are intending to work in services sector, housing-communal economy, way of life and retail trade yet.</seg>
<seg id="8">However with time, is promise in FMS: the tests will become obligatory for all the visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">One not only will have to hand in the language, however, Russian history, and the principles of the legislation moreover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">One will have to confirm the knowledge of the language both for the receipt and for the prolongation of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exception works only for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is state language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also people who had time to receive the certificates and the diplomas about education before the break-up of the USSR in 1991 are not falling under the action of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The use, despair and the defense are right</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The net of the examination points will work under the aegis of the Russian Institute yazyka the name of Pushkin, the University of the friendship of people, MGU, SPbGU and other Russian colleges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants will be able to take tests in all the towns; already now in Russia more than 160 such centers opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Both the deputies of Duma and FMS maintained the initiative for the introduction of test.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here the human rights activists often had time before the law came into effect to ask the question in the press: and what, in fact, will give this?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the binding force of the knowledge of the language both for the Russians and for visitors themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, - the representatives of the migratory service are answering, - this will allow reducing the quantity of the people that are suffering from "labor slavery".</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many people are talking about the defense of the rights of the labor migrants now, is explaining the head of the representation FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The defense of their rights has to begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only the system of the organized typesetting will allow resolving the foreign workers' problems of 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems appear with the migrants without occupation, education not knowing language, not having a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of the language, - Sebelev is convinced, - the future migrant is condemned to come across with the careless people who will put the help under look sticking the "voucher" for the weird narrow barrack his into a day where it is and dozens of the ones similar to it tomitjsya without food and documents for months for 12 p.m..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We are receiving the mass of the complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the home" they "are promising them one, deceive but on the arrival of them, they are taking passports, they are not paying promised wages", a boss of the Head Office of the labor migration MS of Tajikistan Tolib Waripov is confirming.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics going on payments to Russia will confess that they not only do not know language of the country into which they are striving, however, to which they are writing with difficulty on the own ones.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this not so much their guilt, as trouble: few Turkomans, the Uzbeks, the Tajiks can allow themselves to receive even the clear primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it is not even allowed at their families to feed the children with anything, without speaking really about in order respectably providing clothes for them, putting shoes and equipping for the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Reaching a podrostkovogo age, such children set out under the first after all possibilities on some payments.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult if it is bad with the knowledge of the language: they are confessing.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and defective".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The human rights activists have been celebrating one important moment really, with regard to law on language.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If status is not here: there will be neither an examination, nor a following official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the big part of gastarbaijterov as before live in Russia illegal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"You are welcome, or the entrance is prohibited by the foreign one"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of visitors are asserting what the official status not so simply to receive in our country.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reason is also everything in bureaucratic impediments the same linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, legalization costs money: from 12 000 to 16 000 roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And here one can do the false registration for a thousand five hundred fast and in total.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The co-workers of Russian police know, what with us mainly the false documents, there is no registration, from here and the cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They are inviting a hundred, two on the cigarettes, tea": the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Xuwkadamov shared with the journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Naletaij, do not scrimp, buy the painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Into the first after all it turned out a day of the attachment of the law on language that not only migrantskie documents about registration are false sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="47">A few "linden" certificates of the passage of the linguistic tests have already been confiscated by the co-workers of FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">The counterfeit papers are printed on the normal colored printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they were passed down to the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants who hoped in this way to ease themselves task of the passage of tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.</seg>
<seg id="50">This into two with the unnecessary one a time more expensively than the procedure of the official test: it will cost the labor migrant three thousands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In that, what is main task for the near future both the representatives of the authority and human rights activists are getting together to defend the system against corruption so that it would be impossible to buy "the crusts" simply.</seg>
<seg id="52">After all the authorities can promise yet time for the research of the basic linguistic course to gastarbaijteram not being able from the start successfully to go the test.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, the work in the spheres which do not suppose the active contact with the people will be offered by the visitor who does not know Russian.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Up to quarter of all the American teenagers is fitting through the work in the booking office desk "Makdonalds"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During the last days on America the wave of actions of protest against the low wages in the department stores of the corporation Walmart and the restaurants of the popular nets of the fast nourishment such as "Makdonalds", "Burger king", "Tako bell", "Uehndis" and "Kentucky was taken "fraijd of chiken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">While no one is touching not to predict, this wave will turn into the ninth bank or it is predestined to vydoxnutjsya on early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The actions support unions and the series of the left public organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides the rise in the frugal wages in the goal of the organizers of protests which row workers Walmart and systems of the fast nourishment are receiving a creation in them of the trade union organizations is.</seg>
<seg id="7">This sector of the economy has almost not been being encompassed by the labor movement yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The actions began last week after a Day of thanksgiving on so-called "Black Friday" after on America the orgy of cheap rasprodazh moving millions of the Philistines and being accompanied by the brawls sometimes had crashed down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day some workers of the corporation Walmart in which 2.2 million people are working all over the world abandoned their jobs and picketed the shops of the corporation together with unions and the left activists, whose product be raschitan on the people of the modest and average prosperity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart is dealing in all in the light, from the diapers, the hunting guns and automobile batteries to the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products are on average cheaper than in the big supermarkets in his shops from 8% to 27%.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore many workers Walmart being low-pai are stocking up only with themselves at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Accessibility and the assortment made Walmart one of the biggest corporations of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the critics, Walmart can partly allow itself to sell the product of podewevke because few are paying to its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The last ones are also complaining about difficult working conditions, for example, about the shortage of the fork lifts or the manual scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the actions on "black Friday" demanded to raise the wages and were complaining on the cost of medical insurance which is granted by the corporation galloping from 30 to 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">They said to the typical worker Walmart receiving 9.5 dollar per hour this expense is not affordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The scientists from the Californian university in Berkli are proving, what if Walmart will increase the srednuyuyu wages up to 12 dollars per hour, this will cost 3.2 billion dollars to the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is spending on the wages more than it 1.1% approximately now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart whole will transfer the growth of the wages to the customers' shoulders, every visit to the shop will more expensively of in total 46 cents turn out for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will spend more on some 12.39 dollars than soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The supporters Walmart quite note that the actions of protest occurred in in total nine staff and corporations did not cause a maleijqego damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" was going on in her shops from 8 o'clock of the evening on Thursday until the midnight of the next day, and meanwhile Walmart sold about 5000 product in a second.</seg>
<seg id="25">All in all her cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the corporation Dehn Fogelman reconfirmed an interview the left site Huffington Post, that all in all the jobs abandoned "less than five" co-workers Walmart, and that the action of protest was "the" all in all "next piarovskim trick" of the union which organized it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"The free booking office desk"!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, where not department stores Walmart (they are not granting them in this progressive town, and therefore they have not been here yet), but "Makdonaldsy" and other cheap restaurants were their object.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Makdonalds says that he is selling billions of the portions both after this it is even not giving you the ones hospital and is not paying you for an honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Dzhumeijn Uiljyams, member of the city council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At present moment the minimum wage is 7.25 dollar, according to federal and New York legislation, in hours.</seg>
<seg id="32">The restaurants of the fast nourishment have increased it with time, but a little, and on average their ordinary workers are receiving in New York 8.90 dollar in hours.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one is earning less than they in this expensive town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How one inscrutably can exist in New York of such money, for me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">A quarter of the American teenagers who earned on the side behind their counters after the school at the same time living with the parents fit once through "Makdonaldsy" seemingly.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly anyone saw the main source of food in this or planned on staying there for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">I am constantly striking against the interview with the workers of "Makdonaldsov" which are complaining about their having to live off these wages and even to feed the children on it sometimes immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment the author of which is noting is hanging irresponsibly to bring the children if you do not know, on that you will feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the actions of protest, which began near "Makdonaldsa" in the 40th street into 6.30 а.m. on Thursday also on Mehdison-avenyu, required that at the minimum 15 dollars began to pay the cashiers and the cooks of the system fast nourishment at an hour, doubled them that is more than the present minimum payment.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the sphere of the fast nourishment the trade union organizations were created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The American law prohibits to administration from hindering this and punishing the activists of the labor movement the faultfindings and dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, an administration infrequently eases their life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But surround with union the fast nourishment complicatedly and according to objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluctuation of the personnel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The noisy protests took place on this day and at the row of other cheap restaurants of Manxehttena.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">A meeting was the culmination of the action in the middle of the day near "Makdonaldsa" next to Times public garden into details, the member of the city council Dzhumeijn Uiljyams declared on which a few local politicians democrat appeared: "Makdonalds" says that he is selling billions of the portions, and after this it is even not giving you the ones hospital and he is not paying you for an honest work"!.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">For example, also other prominent New York democrats supported the demonstrators the candidate for post of the mayor of the town Bill De Blasio declaring that "we have to enter amicably the support of the workers of the fast nourishment so that they would achieve the fair payment and the economic well-being which every njyu-ijorkec deserves"!.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As New York Times described the occurring one, this was the biggest action like that in history of the American sphere of the fast nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred participated in it the person, were moreover by no means always of them workers of the fast obqepita in which in New York dozens of thousands of people are taken up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">While it is unclear, will this spark generate the flame of the mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">"To deceive the brain yet turns out averagely"</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The popular one among the admirers of the modern technologies is taken the topic of the supplemented reality recently mainly to perceive across the prism of the special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At first in its annual conference Google showed the functional model in the summer, and then in November it became known that I/you/she handed in the application to the appropriate patent also to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">What for the scientists, however from a conversation with the leader of a group of the interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft Kehmbridzhskoij laboratory Waramom Izadi follows, given to the company the glasses - the gone stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">A perspective of manipulation beckons them with virtual objects in air the bare hands, the creations of the virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Say, please, in common ways that your research group is doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with the interaction of the person with the cars, but at the same time are trying to move the borders of this interaction apart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The mankind has stuck in mass yet on the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanjya in them the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all we want to look of 5-10 years into forward and to foresee the fundamental changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the prefix Xbox and the sensors Kinect are step ahead, and hardly not a single Xbox is selling without Kinect today, but the zhestovoe department is interesting in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What has still been waiting for us ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- In spite of the fact that Kinect postponed the interaction until physical layer, many things occur on the flat screen up to now, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input of the information improved (the system is receiving more data), but conclusion has not been yet not really.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, are working on the truly three-dimensional systems of representation on the basis of different technologies, including projecting.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let out the computer peace into ours, physical, it to make it be felt.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, for this it is necessary to recognize the user not only, however, the space is around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that time we will be able to supplement the real world with the virtual objects in much more comfortable form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all these idiotic helmets of the virtual reality are to the devil!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about vocal department?</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular piece, but they do not think of it too highly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It is impossible to name it panacea in a certain way - a question to privatnosti gets up because it is not always desirable the associates to be informed about its actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a matter of fact all the types of interaction with the computers are good, but each is in his niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for a control of the devices in places a project was within the framework of which we thought about some gestures but not over wide, but over such avaricious, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time the gestures were being taken off not with the camera tube of the device, but the wrist bracelet which fixed the movements of the bones and the muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been big yet, but one can theoretically diminish it to the size of the wrist-watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, for example, in general, future behind the mixed type of the department is zhest+golos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- This how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, ask as you me to pass you this can of gazirovki?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will say and will point simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="31">- ABOUT, this will be really complicated to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- That is you want to force the users to adapt under that, what can not or can at the present time the car?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is quite optional, but this mutual approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think, in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of the new types of the sensors which will allow determining the person's reactions more more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, these can be laser sensors, they are giving the good permission for depth, this permission very importantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If to talk about your work with the sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have claims on the modern cameras tubes?</seg>
<seg id="37">Do the permission, the depth or still something not suffice?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The basically present generation is that what one can dispense with in our work on three-dimensional identification.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 k/s to receive.</seg>
<seg id="40">But matter not into themselves the megapixels, but into the quality of the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From the last point of view all the present technologies are insufficiently good for us - this is adding a work the planners of the algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is it is necessary to recall not only the permission for the X axes and Y, however, Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed is really important, the quantity of the personnel in a second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The person's movements are quite dynamic, also present 30 k/s openly little, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stiven Betiwes made from our Rehdmondskoij laboratory the sensor of contact with the delay of processing being regulated is from 1 to 100 msec, and modern serial sensors nearer to the second (60-100) are index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone does not understand as far as this influences the interaction of the person and the cars.</seg>
<seg id="47">The equivalent of such a device not requiring the contacts only would have been very suitable for me in my work, so that the personnel in a second was more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And is it not necessary to increase the quantity of the cameras tubes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- There are three "cameras tubes" one of which as a matter of fact is an infrared radiator in Kinect now, and the second is a receiver of the reverberation.</seg>
<seg id="50">BUT already the third camera tube is this, in fact, the normal sensor of visible span.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not being used for the definition of the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">They could have solved the potentially greater quantity of the cameras tubes problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or you have to redouble it after increasing the amount of the calculations being demanded.</seg>
<seg id="54">Were to create the flexible counterpart Kinect in a best way, to be played for a little while with the curvature of the arrangement of the cameras tubes and to look as this will help in three-dimensional definition of the position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, I/you/she did not present to the public with her glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Does it not seem to you that from the point of view of the everyday use of the technologies of the supplemented reality the glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- That I think about, of course, always walking holding smartfon in the raised hands not really comfortably, but here: a supplemented reality "crossing" would be the steepest version, when according to cloudy platform you could switch from glasses on smartfon, the projection display and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a very personal device, there is their power (only you see the private things) in this, also simultaneously weakness is the supplemented reality will not allow according to the glasses you to work on some virtual objects jointly with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- We will present that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects is accessible not only to Tony Starku of "the iron Person", but also to the mere mortal in air for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem which often the critics of such an idea point out: there is no tactile comment!</seg>
<seg id="61">Nothing feels its arm!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing on this call?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I say often that the supplemented reality is the seventh on bill breakthrough in the person's interaction and cars.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, an addition of the tactile sensations completely become can the eighth.</seg>
<seg id="65">After all one of interesting tricks has been the use of second arm as the original backing for the representation yet.</seg>
<seg id="66">She is excellently registering the pressure!</seg>
<seg id="67">But has and technologies, which are really directed on an addition here these "pictures in the air" of tangibility: for example, the interference of a few ultrasonic directed beams gives sensation in a certain point, where there is the finger, but it has been very weak yet as if they blew you on the pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">Has and the bracelets on the wrists which influence some nervous endings in the fingers are also prospective direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- And did you try to deceive your brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think that he feels that to force it what kind of must to feel at that moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is good idea here, we have not tried yet so to make.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here yet another task is lying which struggling with already for a long time is necessary: that it is going how to force the person that is physically in the space limited really to believe on opened, practically endless is we are working also on the conceptions of the bearing surfaces (not at all such as in the clubs), the moving platforms, as well as the huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">To deceive the brain yet turns out averagely, work for already very many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">Here what is making the work on virtual reality such attractive is many things in an absolutely rudimentary state for the researcher.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vkusovqina is Rosbalt.ru instead of culture</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the "St. Petersburg advanced guard" project dedicated to the town-dwellers who are ahead, in the advanced guard of culture and art.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bright officials of the art-scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements are exceeding the frames of the town have often finding the acknowledgment in Europe leaving out the Russian publicity already hit on the present top-list.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero "Rosbalta" - the grand artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">All the town knows Kirilla Millera - the bearded person dressed in all red one who is meeting now at the Russian museum, now near the Summer garden, now on the stylish parties and vernisazhax.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spectators' crowds have always collected the paintings of the Kirilla Millera where they would not be posted.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of the social-philosophical especially St. Petersburgs tellers of fairy tales, the founders of new mifologiij.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a bright person of the St. Petersburg advanced guard of the end of 80th - the beginnings of 90th.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, it is the person of the town causing the town-dwellers smile through his appearance in the streets, picking up spirits everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently he took the barrel organ in his hands and became St. Petersburg warmanqikom, because I/you/he matured for this complicated role all of its bohemian existences, philosophy and image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, but why, for example, all the same you are going around the town in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> - I elected the red fashion designer who is engaged in look and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this peace the red is compromise among the artist, imidzhmeijkerom and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although there is everything in a society, what slightly not gray, it is causing an aggression and the stimulation of the hostile property.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are directed towards the conversation beginning.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative actions is invitation to the discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - And when did you understand that one has to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - At the exhibition in DK Nevskom, where my work was put forward.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood that this is my road.</seg>
<seg id="20">At that time the wave of the old free unofficial artists went away, but new, free type were me incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I started being friends with the artists of new wave, from postgazonevqinoij which led to "Puwkinskoij-10", and more wave was not.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is throwing me into the theater, the clothes, music, into all the genres, besides word.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - Also все this one closed up into your Art-clinic... - It was to me important to find oneself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where all the better creative forces have to get together.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I occupied the territory in Puwkinskoij-10, and there while there was no repair a musical-artistic club existed, the bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bogemy.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many people were born there: I remember NOMy, Tekila-dzhaz, as the Cord brought with project "Ear of Goga Van".</seg>
<seg id="26">The cord and his friends were singing under the veneer light songs was, they were in the covering tricot, among them stylish nowadays composer Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">After a group had played alive, it became "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Traxtenberg was a leading of many programs until the xali-galivskix times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Traxtenberga, and his great career was going on, and it received the basic education and the education from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">The gallery "D 137", "the" club "Griboyedov are otgoloski from Art-clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There our workers and the habitués went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am the hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000 the polling was in the press, the prize was "The people of our town".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was named, my culmination ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times comfortlessly to work according to old rules, I am the person of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are being shared, one can be popular, but not very cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - The manner to be recognized is inherent in your work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many my pictures are hits, in them an expressed timeliness and an acuteness are bright.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian museum will be in the clown".</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was earlier social, soon being is to such painful and is terrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clown everything razmazyvaetsya, tragedy is being taken off.</seg>
<seg id="43">I like a grotesque, I have groteskovye ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the rescue of the peace with a path of the totalitarian overdressing in prikaznom order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now they are meeting odezhke apiece orienting oneself towards the external mechanics, and not towards inner person.</seg>
<seg id="46">BUT, can, he is not allowed to offer his arm and it is necessary to spit on the mug.</seg>
<seg id="47">Also the deceit will be taken off with the help of overdressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - And recently we saw you in city's warmanqika role. - The cultural town has to have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, as me, them not to be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Of course can and the commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Soon the commercial art has to be accurate, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">A disintegration of cultures is going on.</seg>
<seg id="53">The people contradicted themselves earlier of flocks, bogema liked one, the fools other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Everyone broke up into some micro-associations immediately, everyone will soon like in a difficult way.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am a paper not a hundred-dollar in order to everyone be liked.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now it is necessary to think who will like you.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now with every cultic hero in 100 admirers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - And to Michailov's Stasa come a few thousand each!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Browenki are coming to it, there the sex-social sphere snaps into action.</seg>
<seg id="60">And on cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 000 will not come, and as a result less than management, the money, everything is withering.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have admirers, a main thing: it not to be possible to deceive them, it is not possible to spoil earned.</seg>
<seg id="62">I wrote such pictures in youth, that one collector has them on the wall next to Faljkom and Larionovym hanged.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with the pictures which finish with normally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">They now often mix up ideas.</seg>
<seg id="65">They are speaking: culture is the last will, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture near the consumption, this from another opera.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am the person of the culture of the yesterday, appeared on the artists' examples who lived in poverty and died in poverty, were refusing the money for the sake of the drawing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I in such a here culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, which is not sufficing for St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - The good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such an idea: the official is from culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not each of them is able to be engaged in culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under the right tsars all was not so, the tsars, can, they did not know something about culture not really, but they understood that it is necessary to hold the right experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">Here in Moscow now the good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have the people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they are moved because the taller experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and will give them a road are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now vkusovqinka thrives.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same is distinguishing Ehrarta, but them that they are honestly speaking, that we are not taking on the whole modern art there are such artists who have to look themselves for the other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What for you is St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - St. Petersburg is not not the cultural capital, there is ground in Moscow of culture much more, there.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our stones the art to grow in a difficult way.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers now than the readers, this reader wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe many people are really curious here. which go on the exhibitions, some concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">With us after all this layer is thin.</seg>
<seg id="84">We should make the art stylish, as this it was at the beginning of the past century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is sold on the resources of the grant of St Petersburg</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">The caravans of the spaceships with zemlyanami are leaving for the searches of the spare planet aboard.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to keep mankind, does the main question how to continue its kind with regard to weightlessness or in the same spare planet get up?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is not great.</seg>
<seg id="7">Actually the real planets only two which one can settle at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is Venus and Mars", thinks the older scientific co-worker of the astronomic State institute of the name of P.K. Wternberga (GAIW) Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if in Mars the conditions, more suitable for life, that on the surface of Venus are the temperatures of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">One can live only at a big height or on the orbit of Venus... in the cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They began to approach the questions of the reproduction in the cosmos from the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">They have still conducted the experiments on the plants half a century ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of the raised one did not differ by anything in the orbit of pea from their terrestrial types.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then a discharge is on the orbit of the insects, the tiny fruit flies-drosophila.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 they sent the quails' eggs to the cosmos in order to check how the embryo is developing with regard to weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We are receiving an absolutely normal chick on exit.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here the problem is further beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Problem, connected to the fact that this chick has to find the support it has to walk up on his also to begin to move" the legs", the the laboratory of the Institute of the physician-biological problems (IMBP) of WOUNDS manager Vladimir Sychev is explaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without having found the support, the chicks disorderly somersaulted.</seg>
<seg id="20">And in 10 a.m. with the neonates the complete atrophy of instincts was going on.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks did not react to the light and the sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">There was trouble in in four days their simply dying.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Also two times we vyluplyali chicks, refused after this because it is simply impossible there to work with them": Vladimir Sychev is stating the failure of the experiment with the chicks in the cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With the animals the last time the biological "mini-ark" flew on the orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">However only unisexual individuals will be on the biocompanion "Bion".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">An experiment was with the rats which have already been sent to the cosmos with the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">Basically, they did not discover anything supernatural there.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This just was on the biocompanions, but a single experiment is again, and it is necessary to see off such researches", is noting Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing at the cosmic rats descendants appeared.</seg>
<seg id="31">But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the cosmos yet does not turn out.</seg>
<seg id="32">Complicated task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals, los, the usual habitat, they are not able to realize their the chaff instinct simply.</seg>
<seg id="34">The person after all in contrast to the wild animals, basically, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and there is an emotional podobayuqiij background in the state to create.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to ethical considerations the similar experiments are not being conducted.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the women fly into the cosmos already 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Terewkovoij had the biggest risk.</seg>
<seg id="39">But it is the most precious thing that a mankind has, a female organism is.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Gull flew away, and no one would be able to say on Earth: will it remain after the flight to cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="41">Will it be able to give birth to a child after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"But no one answered this question", a veteran of the rocket-cosmic branch is saying Vaxtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, all in a year after the flight to cosmos, Valentine Tereshkov's first woman-astronaut gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child Andriyan was Nicholaev also an astronaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 the son was born in the second woman-astronaut Svetlana Savitsky being on the orbit twice and even working in the open cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="46">However risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We contain few, a unit astronauts with whom after the long flights everything managed, and a healthy generation is growing.</seg>
<seg id="48">"But if it is more, this is dangerously even on the orbital flights", is an astronaut, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov is bringing result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Also nevertheless, the mankind needs to look for some new roads in biotechnologies, a defense from the radiation, the creation of the artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The hydrolaboratory CPK is the obligatory stage of the preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here with regard to zero floatation the astronauts are paying off the skills of the work in the open cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water is imitating weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If water is for the adults, let a native element be also comfortable, but all the same foreign Wednesday, that for the chest children.</seg>
<seg id="54">Apparently they are confirming small ixtiandry - life went to the continent from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the kid having been in eye-fertile liquid the mom approximately 9 months, is it for him easier to get used to water then.</seg>
<seg id="56">Basically this is logical because from a moment births are from the moment of that first bathing, 2 weeks in total pass.</seg>
<seg id="57">This very few, so that something forget, the instructor of the grudnichkovogo cruise Aksyonov's Marina is speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Word, if for the child who was born weightlessness is more natural state, that for the woman - gravity, a gravity are necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In weightlessness the muscles of the stomach, the pelvis become decrepit very fast, the proficiency in ejection of the fruit falls.</seg>
<seg id="60">Is of course all right, we will lower also this relying on the stimulators of the ancestral activity.</seg>
<seg id="61">Of course, one can go in the special camera tube to the deliveries, it will push it out.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But distant what"? - Valery Polyakov is asking untrivial questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs the artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not fel the terrestrial attraction, the organism will not form the skeleton and a muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The neonate on the orbit impossible as the adult, to dress in the special loading suit for the training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will simply be deprived of what will be essential for him.</seg>
<seg id="67">"Also this experiment which you and I will go to will lead after admitting the child's birth in alien Wednesday to our bringing the invalid, completely the dezadaptirovannogo person to the Earth": the head of the the bio-ethic IMBP OF WOUNDS committee Igor of the Pestles is anticipating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The children's birth has been a matter of theory in the cosmos yet.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, the time later this will be reality, will set out when zemlyane on its ships on the distant planet which will become a house for their descendants given birth to in the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="1">The boss of the Main department of check and auditing: The check of the wvarc-system fell through due to the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the branch of the state purchasings good organs of control are available to the Czech Republic and is falling behind in his application, despite the presence of the qualitative legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is a statement of Miroslav of the Faeces, the vice-president of the supreme department of check and auditing, from interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will be ideal never, but be used it должен right, which" is not "sufficing" with us, in my opinion, I/you/he commented the current situation of the Faeces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of control is granting the similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As the example of the wrong practice they are leading the approach of Peter of the non-hour to a so-called wvarc-system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently the prime minister declared that GDP (the civil democratic party) will not worry the businessmen with the checks - this is leaving is prohibited or is allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"There should somehow be established the law, and if it is suppressing something also the prime minister is not able to withstand the work of the institutions by which is being regarded as the duty to check and to attempt the fulfillment of the obligations" - states the Faeces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the session of the auditing committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project among the Czech and German sides within the framework of which the legislation about the state purchasings both of the countries was compared.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was the talk specifically about?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Probably there is the parallel check which we began in a look, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply said, speech about what the European legislation is reconfirming how the state purchasings have to turn out, a national legislation has then been following and then also an application is in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The whole information was gathered is and, even under still the unfinished check, the interesting distinctions appeared simply said, legislation can be "precise and faultless", however we are inferior to Germany in the practice of application on some parameters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows from this that it is insufficient to create the rules specified more and more, it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in fact can it help you like present project, which it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Namely such a joint control can bring in the deposit into some efforts on the stop of the detailed definition of laws, reduction and the improvement of restrictions because this does not lead to positive result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means the receipt of the appropriate thing in the rational one (but not always low) price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, it is possible, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not fact that we will attain this after reducing the restriction of the orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It is possible, this system will be overfilled "with the papers" so that those who will want to find the loopholes in the present system will much more easily find them than if the restriction did not come down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You are talking about the inner problems of the practical application of the legislation about state purchasings.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how is the system of control functioning in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Does such an organization exist as our KRU (department of check and auditing) there or does this work otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for institutions, as ours Bundesrechnungshof organized according to our principle appears as KRU there, also the board which is working a little in another way exists, but mainly both of the institutions function analogously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Moreover, a power before a certain degree is similar, but there are subdivisions of audit also at the level of the federal states in so far as Germany has a federal structure - their system is somewhat different in this from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can operate only the federal money, state resources are available to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds in our regions and the municipal administrations are being checked at the level of the federal calculating chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for local legislation, is it simpler than with us there?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I would not want, at all, to compare without concrete data, but can take in some relationship Germany behind the model, but is impossible to say that it is better in all in a certain way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This so, because they are better managing the control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It no not no in a certain way, but I will repeat myself, I do not like the similar comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even the model countries are coming up against many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, would they not receive any start from the cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If to talk about an inner legislation, somehow as the corrections of Law on state purchasings affected your institution, do consequences appear?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Taking into consideration, that the legal power of these corrections is quite too short, it still by no means appeared in our work on control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we are carrying out the control in actual fact, it is necessary to take some delay into consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We are taking this into consideration only in the course of the preparation of the future checks - we began to use our new "discovery" instrument of the risk of wastefulness across which we drove almost 14000 state contracts away. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will appear, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of the tenders et cetera are changing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">As you are counting, will the assertion of this law bring the use or the additional burden on the system of the bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is the strides in right direction, undoubtedly, and, I hope, this will be proved correct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem which can arise is such, that the rules "will be stiffened" it will be impossible to observe also them.</seg>
<seg id="40">The businesses on the functioning of the previous rules being checked are tied up with the supplier (for example, the regional functional programs are with a regional counsel) in just any inobservance of the law on state purchasings meaning the violation of the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it it in this way to stiffen the law worth in such a case?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think, what not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system has to exclude those who want who to take away and who to abuse, but not to punish those, who are making the informality that does not influence a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create the even greater pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">AND then how we should withdraw from this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's we will realize, which will not bring this way nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently the prime minister declared that GDP will not worry the businessmen with the checks of so-called wvarc-system. What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is "the Wvarc-system" suppressed or is resolved?</seg>
<seg id="49">There should somehow be established the law, and if it is suppressing something also the prime minister is not able to withstand the work of the organs by which is being regarded as the duty to check and to attempt the fulfillment of the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">One can say: "We will change this law and will resolve this", but is not allowed to say that we will pretend as if nothing is going on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on state purchasings contains the quite strict rules as well as what should formally be conducted, and this is right. This will defend the state purchasings.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, this is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only due to formal shortages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will be ideal never, but be used it должен right, that, is not sufficing, with us in my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">That you think about that, that is smaller that in a month the end of the world has to occur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This vsego-liwj is one of a lot of alarming news on which we, people are, we are caught so easily.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with a group The Tap Tap we constantly joke on this topic and we say that we are the only group in the peace which will be able to gather sufficiently positive energy in order to extend or to avert end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, in December you are preparing to give the absolutely unique ones three concerts against end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Could you tell the readers about this in a more detailed way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The talk is about the national measure for collection of the resources which we have been planning for already two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential which a calendar Maijya possesses against the end of which 21st December are declared into 11:10.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a day before this event, the 20th December into 21:00 three concerts parallelly start in Prague, Brno and Ostrave.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will end roughly speaking, at that moment when on the island the May calendar will be ended with Kiribati in the Pacific the time zone of which is 12 p.m. earlier than with us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who got this idea of head?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This was originally my idea, we further made everyone up together with our artist Gonzoij Augustoij.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not to mention that we want to accumulate it is for the positive energy enough also to avert end of the world, we also want to think together with public about the fact in what state we will pass on this peace to our children once.</seg>
<seg id="14">Because of the ending of the May calendar we created the unique collection of objects from shoes, the T-shirts, the bags and original klyuchikov against end of the world. One can buy these things on the site www.e-tap.cz and in this way at the same time show us support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap also carried out the anthem against end of the world together with other musicians, which is called "End of the world is canceled".</seg>
<seg id="16">It will already really sound polyubivwiijsya the listeners YouTube the anthem at these benefit concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Final, at end itself, if as a result everything will come out and will not occur end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="18">All the executors will begin to will sing it at all the concerts simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="19">The anthems zazvuchat television also in the direct ether of the Czech simultaneously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">I/you/he wrote the words to this song and Tomaw Ganak played Jesus' role in clip, he is also participating in the implementation X Xindl...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you begin to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also cooperating with other personas of Czech cultural life in so far as we are organizing many charity measures and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying actively to connect them to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Which likes because of many things we and to work turned up, to them is interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the gain from concert against end of the world go to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We are so working with civil association Tap for the purchase of the equipment the sixth year in an institute Edlichki for the bezbarjernogo educational center STUDEO, already.</seg>
<seg id="27">The lecturers regularly visit the students of the schools of the institute Edlichki and are organizing cheerful and interesting measures with them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students themselves do not have any resources so that to set out to the lecturers, and we are trying in this way to grant them this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework of the project of the additional construction of the institute Edlichki in future the building to which we will move with this project will arise separately.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">A few bands and executors will appear at every concert.</seg>
<seg id="31">Were the criteria of selection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We were trying to put together the program which will interest all the generations, including the children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere s Danom Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjyan Bango and Irzhi Suxi will appear.</seg>
<seg id="34">One can hear about all the components on the site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning some similar "grandiose measures" in future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will appear on the "Prague spring" festival and here for the first time, of course, we will prepare the interesting program with the interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we would have conducted the presentation with pleasure in the Czech national house in New York, but I personally, the grass snake if we will be in the USA, I/you/he would want to appear in Washington and Chicago really.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About the foreign country you have serious plans, you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The group The Tap Tap is a group of the people with the limited possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How are you managing the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This not so terribly as apparently at first.</seg>
<seg id="42">With us five participants on the electric wheelchairs, their carriages must travel in the luggage compartment, plus to all is the large number of load and boxes with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, they have been managing this without problems yet. The Czech airlines ČSA and British Airways British airlines have always been prepared excellently for us, which astonished me skoljko raz.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything was going on without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to exits abroad you can compare different countries from the point of view of accessibility, the relationship of the public to the invalids et cetera.</seg>
<seg id="46">What were you encountering by present moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is functioning better than with us, in Russia we became the witnesses of what there is still in the east at the basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are very many barriers in comparison with Prague in Moscow, and an independent movement of the person has here still been coming into the rarity on the electric wheelchair downtown.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are not such banal things also in development, as the road to be made for the invalid in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, the public organizations which are trying to turn the people's attention to the people's problems with the limited possibilities arise also there already.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what, conversely, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are very many things the level of the implementation of which is distant it behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But you importantly have to specify that an improvement and an improvement of situation have always depended from those people's efforts who this is concerning.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is completely normal that the people are independently moving with the heavy form of invalidity in the streets, they can go into the toilet, to the museum, yes where it is pleasing...</seg>
<seg id="55">There not really that is not spread, that they are receiving the large number of the people with the limited possibilities the active participation in public life, we are surpassing The Tap Tap and it in this some!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public or bezbarjernostj are one thing, but will begin to change always and really at the moment when among us the well known athletes, the artists, the actors, the politicians or the jurists will appear at that time.</seg>
<seg id="57">These have been individual cases - the people with the strong will yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is really popular at present, but we will return for two years ago, that in 1998 forced you to organize it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the institute Edlichki as the educator, many young people who wanted to begin something were around me.</seg>
<seg id="60">BUT in so far as I myself the musician and I am playing including the saxophone, an interesting musical circle organized that together with the co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="61">Is of course, and with time as our leading Ladya Angelovich is speaking emerged this a little from under the control (he is laughing).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">After all did popularity come only in the last years, or am I hobbling something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">This is the truth, that helped us, that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of a group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to a conclusion, what the work which no one can appreciate in essence as if it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the resources of the European Union we can allow ourselves qualified lecturers, an equipment et cetera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Were you faced with the goal to untwist The Tap Tap so well?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the outset I have felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Show Business is full of things, imitating to another one.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all new one is being taken with caution, and this has lasted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Very few rare things exist, but I will take the liberty of saying that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">Of course, the first impression with the person who sees us is compassion, this is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely excessive because the people with the limited possibilities are not some personalities being damaged and всеми given up which we have to spare.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live for full-fledged life and develop, final, provided they possess the necessary resources only.</seg>
<seg id="74">I am speaking, what if with the people with invalidity something turns out, this the shift not only for them, but also for all the society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Provided success that you are a severe leader what many people consider you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and to hold a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people are coming to us with romantic presentation and are flying in the clouds, but when they will hear about two times a week their having to go by the rehearsal, to visit preparatory courses and to spend much time on the way they are losing enthusiasm very fast.</seg>
<seg id="79">But so it is occurring in just any group which wants to work and to attain something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At present numbering a group The Tap Tap is twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many their were at beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Agree Angelovich.</seg>
<seg id="83">We an open group, the people are coming and are leaving, it is impossible to avert this.</seg>
<seg id="84">Our doors are always for those who have wish and a will power are opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will take place in a day before the end of the world to be expected, on Thursday 20.12.2012 v 21.00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will take place, to Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrave - in the center Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and the other musicians of the Czech Republic, in Prague on the stadium Incheba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">In the completion of concert all three towns are being joined into the moment of the singing of the song of a group The Tap Tap by the telebridge "End of the world is canceled".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The goal of the present project is to gather the financial resources of a volume of 25 million crowns on the purchasing of the multifunctional bezbarjernogo equipment for the educational center to STUDEO attached to the institute Edlichki in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The ticket for concert costs 400 crowns, for the children up to 12 years the entrance is a free one. One can buy the tickets in Bohemiaticket beforehand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week on the session of the ministers of the European cosmic Poland agency was received by the twentieth member of European cosmic agency like the second country of an eastern block being from the countries (after the Czech Republic which became a full member EKA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began the narrow cooperation from EKA in 1994 and has taken on the active part in the series of the projects of the agency for following years.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Poland began the way to the cosmos a lot earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Polish enthusiasts have still before the Second World War been dealing with the flights to the cosmos, but this has always not met with an understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I will remind, to example, about the lecture of the A. Wternfeljda who presented on December 6, 1933 in the astronomic Warsaw observatory of the idea from his innovative work "Introduction to aeronautics".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (1905 g.r) they left an auditory indifferent, after a few years Wternfeljd remembered, what was interested only the doctor the Yang Gadomskiij in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France Wternfeljd won the prize of Robert Ehsno-Peljtri and Andrew Luisa Xirwa for "introduction to aeronautics".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor is the Yang of Gadomskiij (1899 - 1966) which people were talking about above, later became the great propagandist of astronomy and aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote the row of the books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskiij became the well known world propagandist of the aeronautics, and his deposit was appreciated by one of the craters being named on the reverse side of the Moon in his honor among them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The railway trolley, equipped the rocket engine, had already in 1925 in Poland been built.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, or the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even is not clear, the rocket was expected to be used for a run or for the braking of the trolley.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information about this trolley is well known only from the press of that epoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to be thoughtful about the rocket arms.</seg>
<seg id="17">I/you/she carried out the research the Section of the technique of the armament on the cooperation with the professors by Mechislavom Voljfke and by Gustavom Mokzhickim.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is obvious from the materials which remained that the researches reached the stage of the practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the coming of the German troops the work was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in the specialized press the idea of the photoelectric rocket fighter plane which engineer Rogozinskiij offered appeared also in the next year left work "Air rocket torpedo and aircraft rocket bomb" of the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblockogo.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both of the projects were developed for the war use of the rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before war itself the Temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated the whole work dealt with all the projects of the war use of the rocketry.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work ended due to the beginning of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work dedicated to the aeronautics appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to the work of the Polish of the society of the aeronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">A society is being mentioned for the first time in the November number of 1954 of magazine of "problem" in which four volumetric articles about aeronautics are being published.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them the professor is the M. Subotovich offered to organize the society which will be engaged in aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time already the revolutions gathered the projects of the artificial satellites, and it was clear that the cosmic researches are the prospective branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of the aeronautics (POA) has tried to enter the international federation of aeronautics (founded in 1951), and POA already became her full member in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the next year first chairperson POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chair of the International federation of aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">On this post it stayed before his death which began in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 POA has brought in the considerable contribution to the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket of RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket which fulfilled the research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first startup took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was in length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">The improved version RM-1A was subsequently formed, and the tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were carried out in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovskom wasteland.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket was in length about 1.4 m, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The following version of the rocket has been already to do present scientific work in the state - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and an observation of the high-level wind was her job.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962 the further development was stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">A rocket Meteor-1 worked out in the period between 1962 and 1965 became the heiress of first rockets of the type RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived like the two-stage one, her common length was 510 cm, and the initial weight is 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types were worked out (designated as Метеор-1A -1V and -1S), which differed with the size of the camera tube for the scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">A space with a volume of 0.4 l was available to the rocket Метеор-1A, Метеор-1V is 0.34 l, and Метеор-1S is 0,62l.</seg>
<seg id="42">All three types had the maximum flight range 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 at the Aircraft institute a development of the rocket Meteor-2 was going on, and her first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 with the starting weight of 380 kg was capable of taking the payload with a weight of 10 kg on a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then the versions Метеор-2N and a Meteor were formed-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is it also to mention the entry of Poland in KOSPAR (the committee on cosmic researches) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee worth KOSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Moreover, within the framework of program Interkosmos, Poland participated in the researches of the outer space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germawevskiij became second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remeka.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The abrogation of the law on public relations is not not the solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the constitutional court annulled the law on public relations.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decree caused the lively discussion in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Is without a doubt, it will be interesting to look at some present problems from wider point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The economic liberal-oriented systems in the EU, also like also in the globalizovannom peace is based on the principle of the plural, nonadjustable economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence this means that separate economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are with each other in a constant conflict.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is connected to the principle of the free trade and free, nothing together with unbridled financial speculation by the not limited movement of private capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of considerable difference in the cost of the workforce (wage) the price effort arises.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is necessary by this idea to understand the state with goal to take away himself the big part of the market and, in this way, to increase its own income when the producer by means of the delivery of the cheap product is trying to stand in economic competition to those which "is knocking" the competitor's cost down.</seg>
<seg id="10">On mass scale this means either the transfer of the production abroad, or the cheap purchasings abroad or disappearance for the majority of the businessmen. As a result the unemployment in those is being improved in the countries, where a cost of the workforce is, in comparison with the other ones, high.</seg>
<seg id="11">In so far as the private capital is not bearing any social responsibility, among them also for the unemployment which was made for them, the inevitable expenses of the state for social needs grow.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a whole, the situation strengthens the businessmen's misters' reluctance to pay taxes and in this way to compensate for a public economic and the social damage that is caused by them in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to list the concrete statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brusque methods of the quotient create the capital at the level of the economies of separate states of situation when the governments of the countries have to enter a competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population with the aim of attraction to the country of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments are giving their own population to private capital to arbitrariness, despite social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This finds its reflection above all in the changes of the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is goal economically to force its people to yield to the dictate of private capital, above all in the field of the wage.</seg>
<seg id="18">This works like the system of the economic force in the event of long unemployment and serves as an instrument of cutting down of the workers' rights in the sphere of labor legislation at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result the level of poverty is improving, but at the same time also difference among poor and rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">IN THE FRG already a few years exists the public dispensation of the products the poor ones which are not in the state to feed himself its own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The quantity of these people has already approached a million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within the framework of the rise in the competitiveness of the German economy the cases are constantly going on, when the people placed in a job are receiving such wages that the state has to pay them the remainder so that they would receive the bare subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The similar scandal became well known public and in the event of the additional workers of Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic measures practically in all the southern states of the EU, is without a doubt, they are leading to the same state, in which the people that are under the pressure of the catastrophic fall of the social status have to emigrate either as this was in the 19th century, or to exist on the starvation wages in the backyard of the society in the hope that sometime to the country the private investment capital will come.</seg>
<seg id="25">However is the question arising from where it will have?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the capital will arrive from other countries of the EU, that is poverty to move from one country into another, or it will not come at all, so how the Chinese, indus, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African has still been working for the share of European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is concerning the whole Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the mass media before the nausea assert that the state is not able to participate in the capital of its own economy, which the controlled economy is leading to an economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">He is stubbornly drawing the private capital on the state not should be added to the economy by action administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then it should answer the question whether the private capital does not work conducting policy and that now practically very integers the state, in its own egoistic goals?</seg>
<seg id="31">Unambiguous answer - yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">An existence of the practically vsemoguqix and omnipresent lobbies is proof in all the states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As result we have the perpetual situation showing in corruption, the securing of the mutual advantages, in a legislation where everything is deserving punishments practically, however it is not crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">IN THE FRG the situation is such, that the state ministries due to the shortage of the financial resources are entrusting the development of the bills to the private legal firms which are densely connected to an industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then Bundestag is confirming these bills.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the authority is coming not from people, as the constitution of the western type says, but from the financial-powerful groups that prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy is lying in such a situation fast now as this is described the Appianom one in the work "Crisis of the Roman empire during Caesar's days and Pompeya": "The state has been breaking up for a long time, and the departments are dealing with violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bribes, the illegal receipt of the favors with the help of the stones and the swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption throve without all bans, and the people went to some elections with sold beforehand people golosom""...poryadochnye in general did not run on the sovereign's post, finally the state for eight months lost the consul once".. .. They seriously began to talk about that, that autocracy and a necessity of choice are the only rescue in this terrible situation hustler".. Appian thought that this will be Pompeij, but Caesar who changed democracy by autocracy in a final way became it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As well as anciently, in modern society their own reckless interests without account-taking of the public interests predominate.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital has not been intended for the application in public goals anymore according to its essence.</seg>
<seg id="42">The present result is not different from a past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without some effort to conduct the reforms of the deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">Means the cause of the beginnings fascist and we have had to look for the communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Currently one can perceive the absence of these regimes and the existence of the democracy of the liberal type as a certain break after which the next round is being expected.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is above all tragic that that the present elite is ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims completely in future, humanitarian and social catastrophes together with crimes against humanity which we are watching already now, as we know this from old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abrogation of the law on public relations is not decision or, at least, not for ever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the competition as on the international one, simply at the national and European levels the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for the ways for the further reduction of social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">In this way the present tendency has the system character.</seg>
<seg id="49">Political and social goal reforms which will allow strengthening the rate of the state in the economy are decision, the citizens' role in management of the state will strengthen and an exclusive position of the quotient will weaken the capital in society for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israel: The laboratory of chaos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Nothing will withdraw from a violence, and never can leave is Sting, song "Fragile", where words are the main verse of the refrain: "we do not forget what we are fragile".</seg>
<seg id="3">"If my sons did not want wars, there would not "be" they" - dying Gutelj Wnaper, the wife Meera Amwela Rotwiljda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The last wave of violence caused the mass of the responses among Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual.</seg>
<seg id="5">One are in favor of Israel, argu his position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians appear in the terrorists' role, the other ones support Palestinians argu this with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide, be carried out above the Palestinian Arabs, but the role of the terrorist state is being attributed to the state of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="6">I do not want to contemplate about the which in these waves of murders periodically repeating themselves a criminal is but who a victim is, finally, the today's citizens of Israel, including the self-controlled territories, were born on the moment of the current political situation, and no beginning of violence was witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="7">My goal is to offer the readers this to look into the curtain, to look at that, who they are serving above all the effort having lasted already 95 years (counting from signature Declaration Baljfura is in November 1917) on the small plot of land of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some my reasonings are reinforced by the historic facts, several things are taken out of them according to their my own understanding of that who or what group of the people are the main engine of the events of the modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">History of the mankind is history of the struggle for authority above all.</seg>
<seg id="10">We can find the same Alexander Velikogo or Napoleon in every epoch.</seg>
<seg id="11">That it is not so clear: these people have absolutely independently always undertaken their steps, or somebody was behind their throne, who directed their actions to beforehand planned targets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Should admit that they live we in the hands of a few persons in the period, after the world fortune is concentrated, and that he could not occur this concentration of money and authority that is resulting from them in life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among astronomically rich families one who could be looked at like the head of octopus (I do not know whether somebody is above them, but this is not excluded) is standing out - Rotwiljdy.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are not writing about them a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have already in the nineties of the 19th centuries bought the first agency of the news (Reijters), in order to stop rumors more connecting their name to the criminal actions in the highest spheres in the shade of which there being they, and which always leading to the strengthening of their authority, the increase of the fortune or simultaneously both to a volume and to another.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is the big share holding hardly in all the central banks of the peace, and against the countries with them, in whose central banks their share is not available to them, they are leading or are preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan 7 countries were all, after invasion of Iraq 5 countries began, after the overthrow Kaddafi only four remained, however at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).</seg>
<seg id="18">Any, who tried to oppose this family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank behind Rotwiljdovskim Bank of America, during the civil war it began to let his own out (understand are governmental) the money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">The John F. Kennedi began to issue his own money and wanted to reverse FED (the Federal Reserve), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after how I/you/he wanted to take FED for the unbundling of the Great depression to the court in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst of the world authority in the period from 1859 for 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars, the 33rd level that was created by the great Freemason Albert Ration.</seg>
<seg id="22">A destruction of the monarchic states was the task of first war in Europe, the second had to abolish the colonial supremacy, especially Great Britain, but the third has to lead to the reduction of the world population about to 0,5-1 of a billion people (such a quantity of the slaves will be for the securing of their comfort and luxury enough, and they will not use many resources), the creation of the single universal religion (ecumenicity is not able to be another anything besides as prerequisite to such a project) also the final capture of the absolute authority.</seg>
<seg id="23">Method, with the help of which a group of the richest families is working at the head from Rotwiljdami, a call of crisis and a following proposal of the decisions (order ab chao - order from chaos) are.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (watch the basis for FED which had to avert the repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">In this way, after they had managed to unleash the First World War by means of the murder of the gabsburgskogo heir of Ferdinanda avstro-vengerskogo throne to Sarajevo, they destroyed czarist Russia after beginning bolshevist revolyuciiyu.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended in sudden, unfounded in military and economic relationship the capitulation of Germany (there has been anymore no necessity of war for the destruction of czarist Russia) and as consequence, a comminution of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary occurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the relief of the Second World War's unbundling the bankers and the politicians created the latent clash situation after laying the huge war reparations on Germany which they created the prerequisite to the radicalization the masses which grew poor, then Germans of sufficiently strong, blaming culprits and an offerer had to throw only the Chieftain's simple decisions, then to create multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German the minority which had to play and really played a function of fifth column, on the kindling of the fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century Rotwiljdy they provoked the reason of the Zionist movement one branch of which strove to create the Jewish state, Iudei with Jerusalem as his capital (the return in Sion) is desirable in historic field.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aforementioned declaration Baljfura created the prerequisite to the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with local Arabic population began to go on.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks happened from both of the sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War blazed up, appraising whether Hitler broke out of the chains which the bankers, or everything originally held it in which he did was planned in a difficult way, the sufferings of the European Jews created the prerequisites to acknowledgment of the Jewish state with the world association in the concentration camps at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded officially in 1948 and, in the same way as Germany was provoked by the war reparations on 2 world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed so that to create the seat of third war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers will manage to loosen it, Jewish people, like also in the Second World War will become the victim of the combat operations in front line, now already together with the Arabic or, simply said, the Moslem population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is practically a gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp separation of the people on the supporters and the opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty, and who is a victim in Palestine-Israeli conflict, where insult generates insult in the endless chain of violence if everything began with the greed of the individuals and their striving for world authority?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is necessary here to distinguish the average people of Israel from their leaders, because as well as with us, the international bankers are shoving their exceptionally own candidates to the people for vote on elections.</seg>
<seg id="37">The present prime minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is typical example will будет fascist, loyal the international bankers a politician, did everything to begin the war against Iran which, is thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of the cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), to threaten to develop into a world conflict, and taking into consideration the control of Iran over the strait Ormuzskim, all 20 containing% of the world reserves of mineral oil (the navigable corridor is only 2 miles the width): it will also lead to the destruction of world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In what light do the words said by David Rokfellerom in 1994 appear now: "All that we need common crisis, and people will take on the new world order".</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their presentation is the peace of the misters and the slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">Peace, where the remaining part of the human population is serving a handful of the financial aristocracy that is enjoying comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">The target, where every organism on the birth which was born implant the chip with which it is becoming the essence that is under the total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"And it is forcing all small and big, rich and needy, free also the slaves to have on the right arm or on forehead the stamp could not, so so that the person, which is not marked with the name of that animal, or the number of his name, neither buy nor sell.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here in what is the wisdom: every, who have reason, the number of the wild animal can calculate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film is "Argo's" operation: When is worse nowhere, summon Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, the crowd of the Islamist students-demonstrator captured the embassy of the USA in Tehran and 52 accepted the diplomat as hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They must have been liberated in exchange for overthrown check Moxammeda Rezy Пехлеви running after the revolution in the USA which have been a protector of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the administration of the USA the positive issue of situation was not supposed - it could not allow herself to throw out the check overboard because this could undermine the allies' trust in the root in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was not able however to attain the hostages' liberation in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was a blow to prestige of the United States which was strengthened later by the unsuccessful attempt to liberate the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The concluded diplomats were liberated in a final way 444 days later, after the negotiations on the intervention of the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate caused the wave of solidarity and anti--Iranian moods at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The defeat contributed to defeat Kartera Dzhimmi to a considerable degree in Iran on the presidential elections of 1980, finishing up with the election of Ronaljda Reijgana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Film, an actor Benom srezhessirovannyij Afflekom "Argo's" operation describes one of the episodes of that history who brought small victories to America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to run.</seg>
<seg id="12">After complicated peripetias they finished their road to the residences of the embassy of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in the cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, at the same time an extravagant legend of the shelter helped according to which they left on the Canadian passports as the members of film crew seeking the place for the surveys of the science fiction epic in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan which the "evacuation" of Tony Mendes expert invented required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">That the legend was reliable, people were writing in the specialized magazines about film draft, the press conferences were being arranged, the fictional industrial company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details have been held to the operation in a secret for a long time, film, are based on Tony Mendesa memoirs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Affleka is a particular combination of a few genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, so-called "film-kinoopus" history of successful venture, affair is a series of the films about the friends Ouwena can be example.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moods are constantly changing in a film - on the one hand, the conceived scenes are documentarily from Tehran (some captions are shown in the historic sign photographs of events and that how the same situations were shown in a film is the significant distinctions in this are not here).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the голливудские eased excerpts that are intersecting with irony and moderate overstatement.</seg>
<seg id="22">BUT is with the sweat of the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions still the men in the suits are discussing the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Benu Affleku managed to do the реstart of career fabulously.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the vysmeyannogo actor I/you/he became a distinguished director, and his game stopped being the object of ridicules.</seg>
<seg id="25">"His "Argo's" operation is the third full-length film, after the dark detective, detka, "forgive forgive" (2007) also the thriller "Town" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time this is the first film of Affleka who is not acting in the director's home town - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the feeling of atmosphere of the place belongs to the qualities which raised the director's earlier films above голливудским standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also Afflek is showing this in "Argo", where Canada "is playing" Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="29">The better scenes occur in a film in the streets, on the reconstruction of the real events - they are impressing the incoming scenes of the fall of the embassy with their clarity which also passes on the emotions of muddle and nepredvidennosti which arise when history is somewhere suddenly changing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The co-workers are attaining a similar effect of Afflek and it in scenes fictional (the counterfeit headquarters on the Tehran market).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too Many processes are in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director should deal with povestvovanie not supposing the mass of the moving scenes of the cinematographic importance.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something dodumyvaet - there all this is leaving not so elegantly (the scene in which the telephone bell is averting the approaching crisis in America in the airport of Tehran, and the pursuit on the runway look quite nadumanno).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">A distraction connected to the necessity to show too many events in too many places is "Argo's" shortage.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and the John Gudman in the role of the голливудских co-workers are really really charming, however their personages would deserve a greater space, and they are by no means only in film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Film Affleka does not suffice a little drama, this the film which one can watch with moderate interest appreciating the organization and the retro style that recreates the thrillers of seventieth.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it moves with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, this is for reminding of one enough, still in the certain sense of lively history, as well as for the evidence of the that, as the conceptions about vsemoguqix and omniscient special services are exaggerated.</seg>

<seg id="5">Up to now the women had the benefits for life assurance because for insurance companies they are objectively less prone to risk.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">"The people can put forward the further improbable ideas on a contest from the EC workshop until the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Himself the vote will go February 2013, until the end", said Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">For example, also the obligatory addition of the biocomponents into fuel belongs to some controversial disposals of the EU, that as a result the relatively small quantity of hazardous substances, or the guideline are bringing the harm to nature, as well as the ban on the use of the reliable mercuric thermometers because they contain only about the size of the cage for the chickens, as a result in this year the eggs went up substantially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also the actual ban on the use of the "sandwich butter" term or the withdrawal from the sale of the classical lamps were exposed to the critique.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The qualitative bananas have to be the length of 14 centimeters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A European apparatus pronounces the judgement under the pressure of some trade or industrial lobby often, the positions of which are normally defending in Brussels some state or a group of the states (in this way the Czech Republic is asserting the demands of its banks even under threat to veta now).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby are such: for example, the bananas of highest quality had to reach the length of 14 cm in the European Union and did not dare to show "the anomalous curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time the European Commission proved correct with what is only harmonizing the isolated national existing rules which complicated commerce.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless the EC softened, despite the resistance of some states, the standards concerning fruits and vegetables referring to the existing guidelines leading to the dissipation of the products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Also a previous year's decree of the EC according to which the selling air balls have to be equipped with warning about that certainly becomes can a candidate for win in the polling that the children are not able to be younger than eight years to blow them without the adults' care up.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EC turned to the American researches in accordance with which the air balls are potential cause of the death of the children by means of the asthma on game.</seg>
<seg id="17">The similar restriction is concerning the children now up to 14 years by which blowing dudelki into the ones market is prohibited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The funny ideas are born also at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It is sufficiently absurd and the rule that is touching themselves on European officials: every, who has some official post in the EU, can not, taking into consideration the tact of the topic for Greece, a name of Macedonia has to use, and "BYuRM" (former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia) to speak instead of this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com is (Laissez Faire) in the cooperation with the unification of the "principle's of non-intervention's" liberal economists, for example, the EC about the volume of food reserves offered the rule for the territories of the membership state for vote, apart from a few above the absurd named rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EC established the maximum extent of the reserves of the food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic for a day of her entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the established volumes of the preserved mushrooms, for that a big penalty was for her in store.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Both the idea to pay to some countries behind their not having any sea and the idea of the granting of the subsidies to statement about the receipt of subsidies also interested the organizers of the questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas arose in Prague, and not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are in handicap because we do not have any sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will ask the European Union for the compensation", declared the then minister of the agriculture Jaroslav the Carpet (ChSDP) in autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument it pointed out that there was high grain harvest in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention purchasings the state had the full stockrooms of the reserves which was necessary to remove.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Behind the Czech Republic being located far from the ports, the EU I/you/he had to pay us hundreds of millions according to the Carpet, in a euro.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a result the European commission went towards a Czech Republic after organizing the tender on the purchasing of the grain from the countries which do not have the exit to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Offered the subsidies for the receipt of subsidy the villages the Ministry on regional development being governed by minister Paul the German (US-DEU) they had to go to the composition of the statement about subsidies into details, such subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: The quaint orders are exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the decrees are becoming the object of critique, the effort of the EC on control, as well as on more effective functioning and the European Union's development, according to many experts in member states easily, the acknowledgments rather deserve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Deriving of the grants of the EC for projects which do not have even the allusion on something in common with the cavity of the European integration is serious problem, according to the experts, however which member states achieved on the discussion of the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is causing the emotions among the Czechs and that, what like also in the European Union's other countries the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for right to specific identification of its traditional products and it has always not won in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs kept the designation after six years of the battles with the Germans and the Austrians " Olomouckie syrki", however " Tuzemskiij rum", the traditions of which are going in our country the roots into 19 eyelids, our producers had to rename on "Tuzemak".</seg>
<seg id="36">Only the products can be called rum of reed distillate, and not from the sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For example, in the official list of the registered EC products, together with the world-famous one karlovarskie crackers, a pogorzhelickiij and trwebonjskiij carp and a zhateckiij hop have turned out the cheeses of "feta" and "gorgondzola", the marzipan of German Lyubeka or parmskoij ham, already.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also can be proud with the trade mark of the EU the pardubickiij gingerbread cookie and the gorzhickie small tubes.</seg>

<seg id="1">The people want, that I protected a republic, but am a lover, is asserting Okamura.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Senator mister, it is coming as the person of head to run to the president's post?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I do not think about that, in order him to become a senator or a president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If in our country everything functioned without problems, I would not run nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I have not been able to look anymore as in the last 20 years the country is being robbed, as here the thieves are bustling about, they are improving the people taxes and retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">With me was not to be a politician ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something, which I do not like, I am trying to find the solution how to change this.</seg>
<seg id="8">BUT in so far as I was already forty years old and am an independent person that does not belong to any party, do not have another opportunity to influence some things, besides how we should run on the post of the senator or the president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You wound up in the Senate, but soon set out into the presidential castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Are you not turning in this way not facing the people who chose you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have said that I will include myself in the fight for the presidential castle depending on election result to the Senate always.</seg>
<seg id="12">I later specified, will be chosen what if the senator, I will run for the president.</seg>
<seg id="13">A post, a post are not my goal - this is an instrument with the help of which I can carry out my views.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore the largest influence and a widest power are necessary for me.</seg>
<seg id="15">But difficulty not only in our being grumbling as nation with ourselves in the bar or near the television but at the same time are ready to crush whole, who will try to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is increased by the mass media which are blackening the person, and which are mixing freedom of speech up with the freedom of the lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, they talked about me, that I am giving the journalists the bribes, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We will go to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">You began the fight for the presidential castle with theses about the politicians' financial and criminal responsibility and about opposite property declarations about the amount above twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to carry out this, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You as president do not have any such power, and only the whole senate can offer the laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I lobbied that that the carrying out of excursions became free business, this as citizen managed to move.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is being concluded in politicking - when somebody is arriving with good proposal on the left or on the right, they are intentionally repairing the obstacles for him, and this holds back citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As independent independent person I have the much greater potential for the receipt of the support from all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage in that, that I am without party putting away on polochkam, I can take what is best for our country from every party without looking back on dogmas also to use this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider yourself to be a person, belonging more to right or to left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From Czech point of view it seems to me, that the people are rather taking me to left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me at all is not important - a little to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is important for me that we go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="31">Speech does not go about that, that somebody belongs to right, but somebody to left, I want to unite the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always will support any the good one for society decision, KPChM or GDP will offer it, and I will be against a bad idea just as.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You become angry when somebody is speaking what you populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But are you not proving this by your saying?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you are creating the business-plan for the firm, you also have some ideal goals and looks.</seg>
<seg id="36">And to this you are trying to approach.</seg>
<seg id="37">One can name this populism, but all the proposals which I am talking about have already functioned in the peace, or the prominent experts are talking about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But only the mottos will be left behind without support of the parliament for you.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with this in a policy you will not remain for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or you think, that after you will go to the people and will speak with them, that will be a success for you to realize criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I do not have another possibility.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only being trying to convince politicians, journalists and public and you have to try to entice them on its side so that we would achieve our one.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected by the president, that did not put together to organize the direct television transmission in which I will turn to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties with the appeal to legalize the financial and criminal responsibility for the politicians, the civil servants, the judges and the public prosecutors problems.</seg>
<seg id="44">Also they, in the event of the rejection, they will have to announce why they do not want this.</seg>
<seg id="45">If a strong personality which will announce abuses will be one will be able to put the pressure upon a political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the president's direct elections - this was a merit of the pressure on the side of public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I am speaking outright, that I am a lover, and not genius and not the intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to look for the allies in order to assert my convictions and the looks.</seg>
<seg id="49">I am only began in policy, and will try for my program to receive the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">Matters I try to promote independently; if this does not succeed, I will finish in six years and I will return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This partly sounds so as apparently Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not any not the rescuer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know, what one I will do nothing, therefore I went with proposal to run the row of the well known people to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Radimu Yanchure, he refused in connection with the big amount of the work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I supported at least the journalist Yanu Lorencovu carrying out investigations who discovered the swindle with the light fuel oil products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I put forward my candidacy because the people are also really unsatisfied, but now I feel himself on the scales.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people did not go on some elections, and most of those, who went chose the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us of the independent ones in the Senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people chose the Senate so that the changes will materialize with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct elections of the mayors and the governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about a basis for your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about this yet, because I do not have any time on that, in order it to check cleanliness every past potential supporter, also I do not have money on this.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money also for the presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent bill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Do you not have any money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You are talking about some property declarations, but as their your own situations are with this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The private property is being estimated of about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have an area in Prague the cost approximately 25 million, the apartment of 10 million, yet another apartment of 8 million, the collection of the works of art of about 10 million, Aston-Martin of 3.5 million and Wkoda Superb of a million, of course and still a few million on the bill.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way Aston-Martin appeared with me because this was my boyish dream - I have liked always Bond Dzhehijms which drove the car, he was gallant towards the women and he fought against baseness and lawlessness at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You are going on Aston Martin, you own the property of 60 million and you do not have any money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but especially want to invest your own money in this.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not not really persuasive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do I must get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I put already 2.5 million in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">That fact that I do not have any sponsors is testifying to the fact that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">Also I am not obliged to pay for election campaign from my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Expenses for the campaign will cover for me in essence the senatorial wages.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I would not have lived off this money, would not be able to pay the son for the English school which costs 30 000 monthly for example.</seg>
<seg id="79">So, if I wanted to earn the money only, I/you/he would not run nowhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">This means, you will further be engaged in business so that one would be able to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Really did you not say that you will reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this does not depend on the size of the wages.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I also promised, I partially diminished my activity.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the tourist agency in spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people would want, that I was bessrebrennikom who will protect a republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I should also live off something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, how a businessman is, you got used to receiving monthly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two hundred to four hundred thousand, what I am receiving and is more distant.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I became a president, I/you/he would have finished his business.</seg>

<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV prove that the real adventures happen not only in imagination - are 2 photographs on the example of Speijkenisse and his Book mountain built recently</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"This building seems cheerful to me, it looks it can see futuristichno, at last with us again something interesting", Lizette Verxaijg, the passer-by, is speaking on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan is Spermon, a specialist in IT in the large-scale enterprise which was located close by, he is counting so: "No, this building is really beautiful".</seg>
<seg id="4">But I am asking myself: why I am today already one library?</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has an Internet, iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is no one voluntarily going to such old-fashioned libraries, right, now already?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">An unusual record belongs to Speijkenisse, the small-notable sleeping small town near Rotterdam.</seg>
<seg id="8">His population has with the number of 80,000 people very the low level of the education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the fight against this annoying circumstance it was decided a few years ago to bring in a deposit into a common education and to build seven fictional bridges which are described, in the type of miniatures of reinforced concrete colored zhivopisno, on the banknotes of a euro.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also at that time the fathers of the town understood that the only opportunity to manage the statistics remained with them: you have to build the library here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame Maas from the architectural Rotterdam office MVRDV, the skilled worker of the bold bar diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes the even cynical buildings, belonged to a task with its normal calm and I/you/he appeared on the competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on the person.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both while the members of jury were puzzledly looking around and were shrugging their shoulders, impudent Maas made size from its original gift for piramidku and crowned the speech into the defense of its project with the following words: "The distinguished town-dwellers"!</seg>
<seg id="14">Here are it, my proposal: "The book mountain" in Speijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later this mountain with a value of 30 million euro grew.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the part of the project of revitalizacii, which all in all also includes the underground garage, the supermarket, the post office of both the apartment houses fitting somewhat in them and taunxausov on 50 the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of "Book mountain" November "The better library of the Netherlands of 2012" was noted by the second prize of contest.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also the project participates in the national Dutch contest of the wooden buildings of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In this way, the faceless suburb which formerly could not offer anything stood, besides the postmodern pedestrian zone and the astonishing homely city hall the white facades of which they are bringing to the thought about the dairy better one modern work of the architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important thing - in Speijkenisse the first in history of this small town public building of the cultural purpose appeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: book Ehljdorado is under the cap for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Here is only one elevator which is going away in the center of the massif, but the real admirers of architecture and the reading will prefer to investigate this terrain on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">The room that was glazed from all angles is bright and easily visible, the floors of the burned brick and the elegant street-lamps faultlessly create the sensation of public city area.</seg>
<seg id="25">City Wednesday is recreated ideally.</seg>
<seg id="26">The look involuntarily looks for the benches, the dogs of both the youngsters who are playing soccer and the girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are books, books, books also everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The bookshelves are normally along the facades, and in the middle the big dark hall is situated as rule comfortless and faceless" , - speaks Blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We took the classical configuration of the space from our feet to the head and pulled out the zone for the reading from within outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inside space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center the offices, the internet-library, the chess club, the ecological center and the technical rooms are situated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The black bookshelves which serve as now a finishing of the walls, now parapets, now stair railings delight especially.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their look, texture and smell unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">The even tempted architects and the civil engineers are disappearing in some assumptions, what a is unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We strove to work with the second materials", Ijop Trauborst, the project leader, is explaining that introducing the community Speijkenisse, in accordance with the demands of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">Also somehow a time in one agrarian business in Friesland we met the suitable by-product of the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Already many years in the greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands as the support under the roots the artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been being used.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is cheap and is saving the time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textiles have served one to two seasons, after this one can throw it out.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this canvas is for the first time of such volumes: four centimeters were pressed by the thickness in the panel.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the action of heat and pressure so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is turning into dark, homogeneous, firm material, the new car a little reminiscent of smell and a little plimsoll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To a top 105 steps are leading.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who will overcome the way with a length of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary coffee bar by the not only fantastic look at the town, but also the Dutch croquets and the woody fici in the pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They are taking care of an atmosphere, and first of all of the right air humidity on the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Expenditures on new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It is difficult to believe, but this is a building, despite the mass of glass surfaces, a model project is ecology in plan", is saying Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heat of the earth is being used for his heating and cooling.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the Book mountain is under the glass cap, during even clear days the sun is hitting inwards only for a short term.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide farms of glue wood, put perpendicularly the glass facade, they are giving a shade and they are taking on the big part of the sunbeams on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fully automatic roll blind provide the remaining defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the sceptic who was being mentioned higher is from the sphere of IT, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lizette Verxaijg has already also been here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as the lecturer of the traditional Chinese medicine Sintiya Bogard who named Bukenberg "the soul Speijkenisse who has not grabbed for a long time".</seg>
<seg id="54">Reason: a few weeks before opening every inhabitant has received the invitation to donate one book from his own meeting.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books had to take up the empty places on the shelves is yet the library completed completely on that moment there were in it 70,000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">The regiments are forced to the brim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"No nothing" the architect Vini is "more badly than the half empty library," saying Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation every inhabitant is now connected to this new house by some form.</seg>
<seg id="60">Each knows that his book is the part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is serving only as a decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">In this way, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem which is called the creation of identity on professional jargon.</seg>
<seg id="63">Speijkenisse wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Both they will let really young are and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, this is only a starting point for the construction of identity.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on vote about acknowledgment of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the opinion about connections Stefena of the Sabot, the expert among the USA and Europe acting so Berlin is balancing on the narrow diplomatic footpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of a week Germany gave at first to understand that she will vote against the Palestinians' application to the receipt of the status of the observer under the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained on vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stefen of Sabot: Germany is not keeping up the Israelis' action in Gaze.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany necessary be the careful one in connection with her particular relationships with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But simultaneously I think that it is also not maintaining the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to show its independence - without at the same time appearing it is too critical with respect to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained about the introduction of the restricted area for the flights on vote.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result of the NATO conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it for Germany difficult to take up a precise stand in complicated international questions?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="14">Yes, this is so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The thing is that it is in the course of the transformation of her foreign policy but namely crosses from the policy which, so to speak, the USA conducted, to in fact German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is additionally becoming complicated by with the Europeans a single coordinated policy being missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this way, the Germans turn up among two fronts again.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them that they will play the more independent role, but they did not get used to this.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think that they have only felt their role yet, but are on a way to "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy, what France or Great Britain will see off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What after all does the "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This is a readiness to take up in its national interests a stand which does not depend on the position of the USA or the European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends from an economic policy, that is to say from an export and connections with certain such as Russia, China or the Middle East regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany are to a considerable degree different from the interests of the other big states, and therefore Germany has to defend its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Did these economic interests influence a position in Middle Eastern conflict and on the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has the big commodity markets, in particular in the states of Persian Gulf, in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore she needs to show caution in order to not offend the public and the elite in the Arabic countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">At any rate this plays its role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not attach an oversize importance to this, this not completely one-way connection.</seg>
<seg id="30">But at any rate this plays the important role in the Germans' calculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Did Germany harm its relationships with the USA abstaining on the taking of the important decisions such as vote about Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am convinced that in Europe and even in the USA the understanding of the German position predominates.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I do not think that this was the same dramatic break as in a Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is possible, Germany will even acquire the in this way determined respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">But this is warning about what should perceive it seriously as the player on the international arena and with her interests taking into consideration is necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe the different opinions about Palestinian initiative exist.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA precisely spoke out in favor of a veto, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is the divergence of the opinions among the USA and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Due to American internal policy such distinctions have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the government Obamy has a sufficient understanding of the European position in the depth of soul.</seg>
<seg id="41">But, of course, in connection with local political situation the government is openedly not able to take up such a stand.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the essential divergences are not not at all so considerable in opinions, it appears as usual.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you will discuss the relationships between Obamoij and prime minister Netanyahu, you will note that Obama is not excited about Netanyahu's policy at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">On the one hand is it for Germany easy to unite its narrow connections with Israel and the USA and has the condition of the most important partner been in the EU from another?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think, namely this makes a situation such difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, it would be somewhat the Germans more simply if the single, consistent european policy existed, but now this is not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they are not able to appear within the framework of wider approach and have to work instead of this relying only on their own sight of situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">They are namely so treating a euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in future Germany will undertake the leading role in the manufacture of the common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany this is complicated at least due to connections with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This topic has been ticklish always.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think, it is clear to the Germans that they have to play the more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany herself sees itself in the role of the important international player: it will not undertake leading role really?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or does the leading role still seriously come to Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany did not get not used yet to this, is it unpleasant up to now always and, according to evident reasons, it has seriously come up to now always to play the considerable role.</seg>
<seg id="56">We will look, to example, a euro is a crisis whenever Germany is undertaking the important role, the most different anti--German feelings appear.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is not for the Germans simple to manage this.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, this old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by the hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view Germany is located in a considerably more difficult position than the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must take most different neighbors and the opinions into consideration, and this is complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thus, the influence of the USA constantly grows weak in european policy, but at present moment the EC is not filling in this vacuum, who after all at that time remains?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play the more considerable role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like this, it is unpleasant or the dislike for you strengthens - life is such!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stefen of Sabot is the deputy of the director of the Transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute in which the academicians and the political scientist-experts are jointly investigating the problems of the transatlantic association from Europe and North America.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The protection of the trade marks" is in China: when will Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what are Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a designation registered at China which does not have anything in common with the firms, from the name of which it is formed absolutely officially.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless it will be protected as long as, the owners of the initial names will not make the claim yet.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, at that time it is unclear whether they will manage to assert its rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The foreigners in an always more difficult way becomes to defend its trade marks in China", Thomas Pattlox, the lawyer of the company Taylor Wessing specializing in infringements of the rights to trade marks in the Far East, is speaking.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my table it appears in new matter like that every week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is for the imitators enough to add a couple of letters in total in order to receive the right to register its trade marks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So Gucci is turning into Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada one can register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">The German businesses, for example the producer of the sport goods Puma are copied the same way legally.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattlox opens the folder with the recordings of the department of the registration of trade marks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010 the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name which the name of the stylish house Ermenegildo Zegna is also used for there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The that the Chinese are duplication and the infringement of the rights of the intellectual property world champions is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are multistorey department stores which is selling hardly exceptionally the forgings in the large towns.</seg>
<seg id="16">However matters Pattloxa are not such. On behalf of his clients it appears against the Chinese businesses receiving absolutely officially the right to use the name from the department of the registration of the trade marks which is already guarded somewhere already.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese are calling this "ban", a mark passenger, "minpaij".</seg>
<seg id="18">This word is being associated with "ban dakuanj".</seg>
<seg id="19">So they are calling the women who are hunting for the rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities will not recognize the guilt behind themselves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is causing damage to business, it is necessary with this to fight": Pattlox is convinced.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The trade mark is being washed away, the unique position is disappearing, image is very strongly damaged".</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the judicial costs in the branches which suffered are amounting to millions, especially in the event of the expensive products being copied.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the data of the the market research CLSA company, China with the sales volume of 15 billion euro per year is the third in size and very growing into the commodity market of the luxury articles fast.</seg>
<seg id="25">However to achieve the removal of the questionable entries in the roll of the trade marks is difficult, and this costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can last, with unclear issue, up to nine years.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattlox is talking about the matters in which the court turned claims down because the name protested at the end of the long time became "the real fact of the market".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the complainant will not be lucky, that it even will be to pay to the plagiarist because the damage brought it to the trade mark in China must Pattlox is speaking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes he governs the law of the jungle here.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also famous matters of the graphic components.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company Daimler lost the judicial dispute by Sany, by the business which acquired the manufacturer of the concrete pumps Putzmeister shortly before that with the producer of the building cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore the Chinese have up to now the right to use mark, similar to the star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely which bought Volvo used the blue-white logotype which was reminiscent of BMW initially; the process was successful, one had to change Geely it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The producer of the stylish goods Lacoste lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore with whom the famous crocodile watched to another side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The department of the registration of the trade marks CTMO confirms in Beijing that there in 2010 due to the shortage of personnel and the equipment of the rooms difficulties took place.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year "a return" came "from emergency situation in the work process to norm".</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the quantity of the crude matters on objections diminished by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57,000 such matters were closed, it is 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81,500 claims have still waited for productions in department.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is a lot with this it to fight worth</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">How very often in China, the numbers impress.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year in CTMO more than 1.4 million statements about the protection of the trade marks, of hardly third were received more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This also means record, a department announces that China became head of the list of the new registrations in the whole world the tenth time on end.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same is concerning the common quantity of the valid trade marks 5.5 million pieces in total.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 1.8 billion yuans of collections were paid.</seg>
<seg id="47">If to simplify, this means that every registration is in the average of 1280 yuans or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is it to protest it worth as the matter of the German family company shows Freudenberg many times more.</seg>
<seg id="49">During the space of more than seven years the group fights against the Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans managed to achieve that that the illegal production by it of the counterfeit automobile components was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However the imitator secured the Chinese rights to trade mark Freudenberg for himself.</seg>
<seg id="52">This was its own omission, since the surnames are not subject to the defense in Germany, Xanno Ventcler is speaking, the chairperson of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities is in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Also the department of the registration of the trade marks CTMO turned the claim of myunxencev down.</seg>
<seg id="54">Really, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposite direction continues the fight up to now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Necessary be on the alert</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now a question is on the examination in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Ventcler is hoping to bring the matter to good completion and is praising the professionalism of the ships.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he is also speaking: "The process is extremely expensive and much is taking the time from us, the money and the nerves".</seg>
<seg id="59">The inner expenditures are almost giving way to account-taking, the archive of the firm had to glance even through the acts of the centenary remoteness in order to bring proof.</seg>
<seg id="60">Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered "the large westiznachnuyu sum of money in a euro" to the opposite direction for the settlement five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="61">"From here as this costs to us a lot" Ventcler is clearly speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East threaten to leap even to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And if the imitators register unprotected trade marks behind themselves namely there.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese producer wanted in Germany to register the designation of Freudenberg for shoes and the products of leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group stopped production in these fields long ago, but I/you/he has managed to avert the registration despite this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"Necessary be on the alert", Ventcler is speaking.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both it and lawyer Pattlox are advising German businesses to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is insufficient to rely on some international the protection of the trade marks regulations, he is rather following the foreigners is saying "everything it is somehow it what to defend, what to register also at China worth" to Ventcler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise this can turn out much more expensively than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Really: if Freudenberg will lose in the last document of its drama concerning the trade mark, that is explaining to Ventcler he will have to pay license fees to the opposite direction for his own name.</seg>
<seg id="71">Will force out otherwise than we from the market in controversial segment.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A global day of Aids: you have to pritoptyvatj, you have to sing, you have to help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Xaijdeljberge the chorus Imbongi is rehearsing is but in Swaziland the orphans of Aids are happy about this.</seg>
<seg id="3">History of the relationships which overcame the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At first stomping is heard: they are picking the kovboijskie boots, the basketball plimsolls, the ladies' small boats and the man's slippers up the measure on brad floor and they find it fast.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once-two to three-four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only after this slowly increase the voices of the singers - the viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they are beginning, are enchanting and are following each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fite Xopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it is rushing out from his materchatyx shoes nearly, when he is leading them flexible and expressive gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The evening of Monday, in the musical hall of the institute of the medical psychology in Xaijdeljberge the chorus Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of the rehearsal fifty participants of the chorus arrived, from the specialist on the person's genetics before the caretaker, from 23 to 69 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om"Obani" is complicated thing, every voice of the chorus has its text, by same in an absolutely foreign language: the Zulu, which eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland are speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to the evaluation of Unaids, the United Nations' programs of the fight against Aids, in the peace about 34 million HIV-positive are.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland 245 000 orphans of Aids live.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time more than 40 percent of the population VICh-polozhiteljny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans of Aids in the village Ehsitzheni the association Voices for Africa found the bosses in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them visit the school that is preparing for the further teaching.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per month one can undertake sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is guaranteeing money for the school, a school form and the daily hot lunch in the Gogo-center to the child.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A story-teller or vosxvalitelj mean Imbongi in Zulu.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this hall they are not speaking fluently about the Bantu, they can but sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost ten years the chorus learns songs in this unknown soft language and he even brings them there from time to time again where they appeared for the first time: on the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in the distance 8733 kilometers are years from Xaijdeljberga, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, the village Ehsitzheni which depends on the voices of the German chorus is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There live about 2000 people, there are several things in the simple shacks of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children up to now.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them lost the parents who died of the virus ICh.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the miniature the illness of the whole Swaziland is reflected in Ehsitzheni: the highest level is VICh-inficirovaniya, the life-span, lowest in the peace, according to the data of the UNICEF being expected.</seg>
<seg id="28">The circumcision of the men's foreskin which provedly reduces the risk of contamination half is almost not taken on among population.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the virus of immunodeficiency, death in themselves on the middle of fourth dozen is not rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The chorus discovered this village on the joint trip on Africa in spring of 2005, but formerly the participants Imbogni saw the great number of the children in the streets which did not grab not only a parental concern, but also simply everything with: the food, the clothes, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without school education the person does not have any chances at all in the poor country.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first this was separate participants' private obligation: in a few euros to send the child to a year to the school and to give him the chance once a day to receive a hot food.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later the chorus already founded the unification "Voices for Africa" who since then is hardly professionally taking care of orphans SPIDa v Ehsitzheni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The facts about the infections which are passed on sexual road</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important diseases which are passed on sexual road?</seg>
<seg id="36">To the bacterial ones IPPP takes syphilis, xlamidioz and tripper (gonorrhea) away.</seg>
<seg id="37">AIDS, a human papilloma-virus, genitaljnyij gerpes and a hepatitis are frequent viral IPPP.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lobkovyij pedikulez and the itch belong to the parasitic ones IPPP.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups being struck?</seg>
<seg id="40">Mainly the syphilis and the gonorrhea are met with the men who are teaching the men sex.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koxa institute is presuming from the minimum being in four of every five cases of syphilis registered at Germany, the transfer is going on as a result of sexual contacts among the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">With the heterosexual adult people xlamidiijnye infections, trixomoniaz, kandidoz (the mushroom), a gonorrhea and a human papilloma-virus are diseases being often met which pass on sexual road.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spreading of AIDS amongst adults is comparatively low however about 20 percent of new infections of AIDS fall on this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people the xlamidiijnye infections are substantially more often than among the other groups of the population met.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European data, three quarters of all the infections amaze the young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">With us among young people the human papilloma-virus is often also met.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How is the quantity of the cases of infecting changing?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all the diseases which are passed on sexual road are not subject to the obligatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The rate of syphilis has doubled more than, according to the data of Robert Koxa Institute, from 1697 cases in 2001 up to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The quantity of new infections of AIDS since 2007 is coming down.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is smaller than in the previous year approximately on one tenth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms point out the venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The sores in the field of genitaliij, complaint on the urination, allocation, pains can arise with infectious diseases below the stomach, as well as the blisters or compressions.</seg>
<seg id="55">However they are often not being accompanied by pains and the other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one defend oneself?</seg>
<seg id="57">The condoms are capable of diminishing the risk of contamination, but do not give hundred-percent defense.</seg>
<seg id="58">But the stimuli of the diseases which pass on sexual road can partially spread also by means of contact infection and with narrow physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore the experts are recommending a regular inspection, especially on the frequent change of the sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">On early diagnostics one can cure most IPPP and avoid the remote consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Sponsorship, the donations and for the last line the fees for the talks of the chorus on the whole Germany do not allow calling something together.</seg>
<seg id="62">"All we sent in Ehsitzheni already about 200 000 euros", Annete Lennartc, the chairperson of the association, is speaking.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Codva Dlamini, the conscientious and active woman, is controlling the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">She makes sure also that the orphans were placed, for example near one of the grandmothers, well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogos, as they are calling the old women, this woman in the Zulu the support of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them received up to 14 orphans to themselves, they are giving them the roof above the head and they make sure that the children in form appeared in time at the lessons every day.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who relatives did not stay with are acting into the asylum to Xaniijsile, the single woman that is receiving wages from an association, in the same way as also two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Moreover, the association "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, two henhouses built and with American organization for health protection PSI jointly organized the change of analysis on AIDS for many inhabitants of the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is difficult to present, but they prefer about the illness which is so evident in the whole country to be deeply silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"The Aids is absolute taboo", is saying Annete Lennartc: "because it is connected to sexuality".</seg>
<seg id="72">It is quite unusual for the country which the king officially has 14 wives in.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Msvati III, is well known for his love of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such a style of life sanctioned by the state the guilt behind the virus ICh spreading so fast in the last years also lies.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is also lying on the vagrant workers who are delivering the virus on the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">The free condoms are literally in every corner, is saying Annete Lennartc, "but they are almost not employing them.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture is a flesh to the flesh".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to keep up the cultural exchange a little, the chorus Ibmogni carries out the trip on the south of Africa every two to three years and is singing the songs, complete of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which are many on the southern edge of the black continent know already since the times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus, full of the white ones which sing the songs in black tongue - such an acknowledgment brings the good mood and joy not only, but even, happened, caused the tears in front of the eyes of the austere border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">A trip has always brought also in Ehsitzheni where the singers are visiting supported children.</seg>
<seg id="82">In spite of the fact that one can find the small village on the go-cart with difficulty, in the valley of the river Ehculveni it is more than well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go in Ehsitzheni, there is light", are saying local people.</seg>
<seg id="84">BUT after the 8733 miles long flight back into Xaijdeljberg one after the tramping singers are returning as Bergxaijmer to the rehearsal hall in the street can see, that this light is burning as well here.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The cosmic department of the USA proved NASA the presence of ice of the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is also water which froze, although it is put to the Sun the nearest, as it is clear from three researches published in the journal Science on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe "Messendzher" found proof of the region of the planet being constantly in the shade being covered by the ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">His thickness has to be at the minimum 30 centimeters, and up to possibly, even 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hypothetically, water is occurring from the comet or, it is possible, the asteroid, bumping into Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">No one connects the opening of ice to the existence of life in the planet, the scientific leader of the probe Won Solomon said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature in Mercury can reach Celsius''s 426 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="11">However these openings could have helped to explain as water could and other prefabricated units of life hit the other places of the Solar System.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">For the inhabitants the Earth is imperceptibly probes, telescopes and the small robots, for example the "phoenix", are investigating the depths of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">They from time to time send representations to the Earth: the small windows gave into endless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The representation is coming from the camera tube which German researchers worked out from Max Planck's Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the dwarfish planet Cerera.</seg>
<seg id="16">As well as Pluto which has been turning for Neptunom, Cerera, around the Sun on the new definition of the international astronomic union from 2006 is not "a planet".</seg>

<seg id="17">This fragment of the infrared photo of the telescope "Spitcer" presents "the family portrait" of the countless generations of the stars: you have to identify the oldest stars in starlit circle the pink "newborn" stars in the form of the blue points, in a more difficult way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This region of zvezdoobrazovaniya - the scientists are unromantically calling his W5 - is discovered by the telescope of "Spitcer" in constellation Kassiopeya, in the distance of 6500 light years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This perelivchatyij heat of the dying man of the star photographed the telescope of NASA "Spitcer".</seg>
<seg id="20">The ring which is similar to the donut consists of material which the star threw out in the course of the dying.</seg>

<seg id="23">The starlit accumulation the Pleiadeses, also being called "Seven sisters", one can see at night with the naked eye.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, with the telescope of the color they are coming out better.</seg>

<seg id="25">Like the red eye fog winks at the observer the Snail on this infrared photo.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is put in the constellation of the Aquarius in the distance of 700 light years.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="27">The likeness with the terrestrial continent brought this fog nickname "North America".</seg>
<seg id="28">The combination of the normal and infrared photograph provides expressive cvetoperedachu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This new star in all the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of the infrared sensors of the telescope "Spitcer".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturn and his rings: How did they arise - one of the great riddles of the astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is possible, this the fragments of the moon of Saturn which completely disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">One of the greatest and most precise photos of the telescope "Xabbl": the galaxy of the Water gates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Depending on cvetoperedachi the photos of the spiral galaxies are turning into the present works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The photo which was published by the European Southern observatory shows the fog Trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius removed of a few thousand light years.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name Trifid is coming from the Latin word of trifidus (trilobate, three-separate) because the dark stripes of the dust divide the heart of the cradle of the stars made burning hot into three parts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the Ophiuchus' constellation the astronomers photographed the herald of the cosmic clash: in the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth the kernels of two galaxies merging together are rushing towards each other and will inevitably come across.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">This birth of the star the telescope "Xabbl" took off in the spiral galaxy M83.</seg>
<seg id="38">The one who does not like the technical reductions can call it with "Southern Bobbin Wheel" nickname.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The photograph of the cosmic telescope "Xabbl" shows the fragment of fog the Iris in constellation Cefeya.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fog removed of 1400 light years consists of the particles of the dust the sizes of which are smaller than near the normal domestic dust from ten to a hundred times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This representation was put together out of the optical and roentgen photos of different telescopes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It shows the ring from the black holes removed of 430 million light years from the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">This group of the galaxies under name Arp 273 photographed for NASA the cosmic telescope "Xabbl".</seg>
<seg id="44">The scientists are naming UGC 1810 the big spiral galaxy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">There is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way in this starlit fog.</seg>
<seg id="46">The starlit cradle constantly creates the new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This starlit cloud, connected to fog the Wall Socket, it is constantly also creating the new stars - in the distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy shining brightly with the small black hole still no do not raise dust, only gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">The researchers suppose that it arose shortly before Big explosion, when in the Universe hydrogen mainly meant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our views into the Universe: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably, the telescope was invented by Hans Lippersgeem - still before how Galileo Galilei a year later approached the observation of the stars, in 1608.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became more and more is but the spaces that are open to their look are deeper all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, but namely from 1947 to 1975 a year, the telescope "Xale" was the biggest telescope in the observatory Palomar near San Diego in the peace.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror described here five meters had the diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the USA, "The big binocular telescope" is installed.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is allowing watching into the cosmos with the help of two mirrors, each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"The grain Teleskopio Kanarias" has a gigantic inside device - diameter one only the mirrors puts together 10.4 a meter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror Of "the big South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of the reduction of the cost.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches approximately eleven the meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The shortage of the inexpensive constructive implementation: the telescope is fastened together at the vertical corner hard - this limits his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope "Xobbi-Ehberli" also has the vertical fixed corner in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="62">His peculiarity: high light-gathering proficiency.</seg>
<seg id="63">It is reaching: despite the comparatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the biggest world telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of the radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers are listening to some extraterrestrial signals in the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has the diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">Participating in "the Search" project of the extraterrestrial reason" (SETI), just any owner of the computer can help after granting his computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the observatory of the European astronomic service (ESO) is in Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here "A very big telescope" is - that completely corresponding to its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">His four mirrors allow clarifying even the average infrared spectrum in the spyglass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In the Chilean observatory ESO the set-up of "the European Very big telescope" is also being planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">His main mirror has to spread out on wholes 42 meters is and will be put together almost out of 1000 mirror components.</seg>
<seg id="72">However one not earlier 2018 should expect the photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By both of the telescopes of "Kek" were considered in the gavaijskom volcano Mauna Kea biggest in the peace until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="74">Two mirrors are installed in them by the diameter of ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The telescopes "Kek" belong to the observatory Mauna-Kea which watches into sky also with the help of the telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF together with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Moreover, on Mauna-Kea the new gigantic telescope has to emerge: with the mirror with the diameter thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here they may admire the illustrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However a cosmic telescope "Xabbl" delivers the most important looks from the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990 he is delivering the pictures of the distant peaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the cosmic telescope "Kepler" looks for planets beyond the limits of the Solar System - above all such on which life is possible.</seg>
<seg id="81">On February 2, 2011 NASA informed that 1235 planets-candidate were discovered since beginning of mission.</seg>
<seg id="82">On the photograph the last preparations of the cosmic telescope "Kepler" are stamped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">James Uehbba (JWST) cosmic telescope will not earlier 2018 aboard the rocket "of The 5 Arian" be sent to the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="84">The main mirror of the infrared cosmic telescope has the diameter 6.5 meter.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: he has to look for the Big explosion on the light of the first stars and the galaxies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The scientists suppose that there is ice in south pole of Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">However the reliable data about this are not here because "Messendzher" revolves nearer to north pole than the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar measurings during decades pointed out that there is ice in Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe that was thrown in 2004 "Messendzher" - the first which is revolving around Mercury - the scientists are convinced of this now.</seg>

<seg id="5">In southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po-bibleijski venerable age.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here the museum of longevity even exists.</seg>
<seg id="7">The search of the solution is in the country, where the 97-year-old old men seem still comparatively young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">One can name the trip across the Talywskie mountains wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mini-bus with thundering is rolling along the winding road past the hills which were overgrown with the thick forests, the stormy rivulets and the simple peasant houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is all around so green and what one can think as if you are in Wvarcvaljde is bright.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is in a few kilometers all from here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here talywi live one of the people of Caucasus about which it is known a little that they are excellently saying really only that is is on farsi also azerbaijzhdanskom and they are notable for longevity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Lerik is end point.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small small town kichitsya with the too heavyweight architecture of Soviet times which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountainous landscape at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tourists are almost not coming from Europe here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of 323 kilometers eight hours leave because the road has one stripe in total.</seg>
<seg id="17">Legendary fortune, must with which the country the mineral oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province while was not reaching.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced, that there is in Lerike to interest the tourists like what.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In May Baku was famous for the festival of the Eurovision song is but in the next year with us the festival of the oldest people of the peace will take place", Fatulaeva is speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the director of the museum of longevity, probable, only in the peace.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here talyweij from these places which are more than 100 years old zadokumentirovana the biography of approximately eight dozens. Fatulaeva points out the black and white photograph.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, it is 120 years old here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years another child was born in it</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But shepherd Wirali Myuslyumov who supposedly 168 years have been fulfilled is the controversial star of the museum.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence about the birth is not here, however.</seg>
<seg id="26">And with the account-taking that the oldest man whose age is confirmed by the documents has been 122 years old the age Myuslyumova is extremely questionable.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was born in this district in 1805, died in 1973", is explaining Fatulaeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years the daughter was supposedly born in it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like that did shepherd Myuslyumov add a couple of dozens of the years to his age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But even Rembrandt Woljc, the researcher of the age from Max Planck's in Rostoke Institute, heard about the old persons in Middle Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">, one can meet strikingly many people of advanced age also in some districts of China, in Japan or in the valley Xunza in Pakistan, is saying Woljc, in Sardinia extremely many very old people also live.</seg>
<seg id="32">However due to the absence of the documents the scientific confirmation of age is impossible in so far as there were no rolls of civil state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day is the glass of toplenogo butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless there is the fact that people strikingly often attain the biblical age in the district Lerika.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now 20 people live here in an older way than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why here in the south are so many old persons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade is explaining this by particular genes of talyweij.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum Fatulaeva, conversely, believes that matter is in the nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Talywi likes meat, bread and drinks the dairy produce, many out of them most of all on the glass of toplenogo butter every day. However such a high-energy diet can be healthy from diet-logical point of view scarcely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is matter in the primitive way of life which saves the people's youth? In Chengemirane, the tiny settlement close to the town Lerik, Mirzoeva Rubaba lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">At the age of 97 years it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzaeva which asserts that she has 143 descendants lives in the simple wooden house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is sitting on a floor with the barrel of butter, which got without rolls here and there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Here under one roof eight people, including one of the sons and the daughter Mirzaevoij live who for a long time already have had their grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also two kids are jumping close by.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen they are preparing tea which they are serving to armudu in the typical big-bellied glasses for the guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Near Mirzaevoij it is ideal even and the strong white teeth, under the head scarf she is hiding her long dark-dark-blond braids which her son with pride is opening in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always my the hair milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Also I have never used shampoo", is saying Mirzaeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The monthly pension suffices for life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She has eaten always what appeared in its own yard, tomatoes, potato, the green pea.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the whole life I have never bought the products in the shop.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then she is talking about her husband who served in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was the heaviest after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">But became better after "dear father" Geijdar Aliyev had stood near the steering wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">A propaganda is often not heard in the speech of the old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However the cult that is created around the figure of the father of the nation, who governed the country how the dictator, he does not know the borders in Azerbaijan practically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">It was at authority until 2003, then his son Iljxam took on the reins of the management.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old men.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 manats (a euro is approximately equal to the same amount) Mirzaeva receives as the pension monthly, for local conditions this is an amount on which one can live well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And the son Mirzaevoij who grew, possibly, is also right for a long time: "The old men in our culture are enjoying deep respect".</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in big family, are dear, are surrounded by the concern and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">Like what not reason to stay alive as much as longer</seg>

<seg id="1">The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution returned to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competing demonstrations in Cairo are testifying to the deep split of the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution based on shariah was met with the furious rebuff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president did not scrimp on pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have to create the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Also his success lies on my responsibility to people and to god", he said on state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was turned to all the people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Moslems and the unreligious Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But they all estranged in perplexed opposition up to now hopelessly feel fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fear of the religious state in Nile is on the favor of moguqestvennyx "Bratjev-musuljman".</seg>
<seg id="11">Moxammed Mursi said seemingly apologizing, that it cut down on responsibility temporarily constitutional the ships and I/you/he enlarged his responsibility "in order to save the revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However what as a matter of fact the 61-year-old engineer who has the doctor's degree of the American university of Southern California wants to save is not completely clear to the Egyptians and to the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will the justifier be deprived of power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Actually 234 articles managed to carry in the night 15-hour download with the obstacles at the constitutional meeting of 100 participants incited the Islamist, also this partially causes the fears.</seg>
<seg id="15">As well as in the previous constitutions, in project it is being said that the legal procedure is relying on "the principles of the Islamic right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what does "principle" mean?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and remains the matter of the interpretation, one can also be afraid of the Islamists using the indistinct formulation and the legal clearance that arises in connection with it for the stricter explanation of shariah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Alludes, at least, to this one new-brought article: in all the matters which are concerning shariah one should draw for counsel the university Alj-Awar, the most important Islamist institution of the country enjoying the big authority on the whole sunnitskom Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">This does not owe, but what in fact would have can mean that the clergy are overseeing a legislation consequence the restriction of the justifier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In constitution draft many things are the object of interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another problem: the civilians' jurisdiction has to remain court martial.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts served Mubarak's authorities for the members' of the opposition suppression in the period.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the dictator's overthrow there were up to 11,000 civilians in war conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also, as is said in project, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to maintain her morality and values".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">This is legally formulated so indistinctly that the state institutions with the help of this article will be able to check even the content of movies and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">This does not mean with the plain language what another as censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not a single article establishes directly the equality of the men and the women at all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But another prohibits from offending and porochitj Mohammed's prophet and his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">But what is insult and remains as it should be punished, unclear.</seg>
<seg id="30">The formulation is questionable also, that the people's insult is prohibited from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Will the caricature of the president or the joke about the jurist be enough?</seg>
<seg id="32">A matter of interpretation, as well as many things are in this project which offers Mursi for a signature and which, according to his statement, will "very soon" be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution returned"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Already a few weeks the opposition against the Islamists' superiority has been developing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Dozens of thousands of people got together in unusual unanimity in the evening Fridays in the area Taxrir in Cairo and swore to destroy this document still before it will can come into effect.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution returned, and we will win", said Xamdin Sabbaxi occupying the third place on presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Laureate nobelevskoij of peace award and the former head of the international department of nuclear energy Moxammed Ehlj-Baradei declared that constitution draft is place "on the dump of history".</seg>
<seg id="38">Across the service of the short news Twitter he accused the adherents Mursi of the wish to become head "of the coup d'etat against democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"If he will declare the referendum, we will go to his palace and will throw it off", said a member of the opposition Yasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We did not get yet tired, our brothers' blood be not otmqena yet": Egyptian mass media quoted the opposition politician Xaleda Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">Many judges also announced that they do not want to supervise a referendum, that he would have made it invalid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Organized "Bratjya-musuljmane" well called to the opposite demonstration, for their part, but, from caution, not in the area Taxrir, and after the mass prayer in another shore of Nile in front of the Kairskim university.</seg>
<seg id="44">A large number of the women under the covers and the adherents of salafitov who were shouting took part in it: "The people are demanding the application of the simple law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They demanded of Mursi: "Clean the country"! and assured: "The Koran is our constitution".</seg>
<seg id="46">The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began practically provoked the state the civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">The followers Mursi did not want, completely evidently, to take this risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"The Moslem-brothers" declared that both the enemies and the supporters of the constitution draft spoke out loudly and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now the time to let the people decide near the ballot box in what direction the country has to go came.</seg>
<seg id="50">Majority is for the Islamists' project, this is considered the solved matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The idea" of "the human rights" is never mentioned</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Xafiz is Abu Saeda in rage from this constitutional process sped up which, in general, had to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">The 48-year-old lawyer for human rights and the chairperson of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOPR) was defending "Bratjev-musuljman" when in front of Mubarak they were sitting in the prison or appeared before the court.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not because it shared their philosophy of life, but because the human rights for it are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Behind this it was beaten, is sentenced, is arrested.</seg>
<seg id="56">And now the word of "the human rights" is never met in the new constitution, he is sorry in talk with "Welt am Sonntag".</seg>
<seg id="57">The expansion of the influence Mursi on all three branches of the authority in the state disappoints the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are the overt blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of reinforcing a civil state, in fact the president annulled it": Saeda is sorry.</seg>
<seg id="60">But without civil public organizations democracy is not able to function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Even an international community which looks at the ideological fight of the directions in Nile against the mix of curiosity and effort feels Saeda, which everyone abandoned it.</seg>
<seg id="62">Behind this the payment can occur.</seg>
<seg id="63">The demonstrator in the area Taxrir is giving advance notice: "You are creating the monster which you will not be able "to check".</seg>

<seg id="3">Somehow, possibly, is the secret of the success of this country connected to local passion to one extremely fetid fish dish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few pieces of cheese which overripened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put them in the heap of the dirty and sweaty sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave them there on nedeljku.</seg>
<seg id="7">Your smell of rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies otwibayuqiij sense of smell will turn out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am under a name Fagernes in the small small town, in three driving lessons from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">All around there are picturesque looks which were covered by the snow. This is really beautiful, but in air the ineradicable characteristic smell is poured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and roaming in water until a year, depending on what is necessary namely taint to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As the dusks are thickening and it xolodaet, the Norwegians' crowds are gathering for the festival into Fagernese devoted to this very, we will say like that, the taking dish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"It eat raw and wash down he" is explaining "by the liqueur glass of the aquavit, local caraway vodka," Xavard Xaljvarsen, the local fireman by profession also in secondary occupation "rakfiskovyij general" who is guiding the carrying out of festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The people are eating everywhere around us fish which was being cut with the small cubes and are washing down alcoholic beverage with her sizable portions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Somebody likes the aquavit more than rakfisk", is saying Xavard.</seg>
<seg id="15">This drink is capable of interrupting smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am testing a couple of small pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it will be possible to carry the piece is that it differs by from the portion of the continent all not so bad - little under your the nose, then, which you have been transporting with yourselves in the bus for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from absolutely other times, the times of poverty, when, already before the appearance refrigerator is, wetted the fish in the hermetically closed barrels with salt-water in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the deep winter, when the fish already wandered well and soundly, they extracted it and after smothering the perception with an alcohol used into the food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Mainly, there is that fact that thousands of Norwegians had to abandon their country in search of work and to emigrate in the USA already in the memory of the past generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now after all the population is precipitantly growing - more than 13% immigrants are who the jobs, the high wages and the developed system of the social welfare pull here.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden come (the old rival but еще not long ago and much the more well-to-do neighbor) massovo to work here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is being perceived as certain important symbol, an indispensable symbol, although somewhat the fetid component of the past Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is one of the most expensive local dishes.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, everything is expensive here - the small glass of beer or the sandwich will cost you 9 pound sterling (14 US dollars).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway infrequently appears in world news, and the majority of the inhabitants of the country is organizing this, similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The people are unwillingly mentioning the name of Andersa Breijvika, the racist and the extremist of the right sense shooting last year and killing 77 men, women and children here up to now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Without mentioning his name, they are calling the terrorist attack "the occurrence on 22nd July".</seg>
<seg id="29">It is for the Norwegians really difficult to believe, that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens turned up capable on similar atrocities and murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the basis of the today's well-being of Norway a growth (since the beginning of seventieth) of one of the biggest petrol branches lies in the peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"However mineral oil is the cause of our prosperity not only", is saying Anna, our waitress, the woman with the long bright hair and the striking light blue eyes, delivering the trays with withstood rakfiskom is the realization of the Nordic well-being.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We such a people - you are calling this as you - rational.</seg>
<seg id="33">As well as the majority of the Norwegians, it are excellently speaking English.</seg>
<seg id="34">We do not love being posted on a presentation, we are not boastful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway is very carefully turning with its mineral oil - the big part of the earnings of the petrol branch is being invested into the special fund created for the welfare of the future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In years preceding the global financial crisis, when everyone sorili to the money, which they did not have Norway frugally calculated all the expenditures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"While" one "can ski in the winter and go to the excursions of the summer, this is for a happiness enough", is saying Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Also there is rakfisk", she with the careless laughter is adding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow in a line for some food - rakfiska from me will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="40">Here the burger with losinym meat is really exact exotics, tasty juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But us waits with the evening the even greater quantity all of the same fish with unforgettable smell.</seg>
<seg id="42">In my hotel they are organizing special supper, rakfisk let in, in the course of which the visitors are determining a best with vote or, it is possible, the most aromatic fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult beginning of career lies ahead of the president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the new president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto is preparing to enter a post, BBC of Grant's Uill correspondent is inviting us to look at the difficulties which it will have to come up against, and at the mixed expectations of the population of his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Road traffic is soon in Mexico City in an especially sad state.</seg>
<seg id="4">This town is overloaded by the transport and the steel obstacles cutting off a few key highways to the capital and causing chaos in the roads were erected in the better time, and since Monday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However this was not done in order that it will not be possible to let for the people to reach to work from the suburbs, but in order to prevent the participants of protests from winding up to the building of the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Sunday the new head of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto will put on the presidential sling and will take on the reins of the management by the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A complicated task is before it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico made good economic levels attached to the administration Felipe Kaljderona who now is packing her power, however the country wallowed in the war against the drugs which has already taken away about 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">My government is declaring" to the people of Mexico about its readiness to fight a violence", informed Mr Penjya Njeto the president of the USA Barak Obame in the oval cabinet of the White House earlier this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I am preparing to offer new security strategy, aim which will allow us to reach this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before such statements next to the president of the USA the political career of Mr Penjya Njeto was developing in the post of his governor of the native staff of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his home, in the densely populated and vast staff of the opinion about the new leader surrounding the capital of the country they differed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The straightforward person</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic small town Valje-de-Bravo, to example, they remember it with heat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The inhabitants are putting him enlivening of tourism, the development of the resort sphere and the creation of the infrastructure in merit.</seg>
<seg id="16">One may reach the town from the new highways, built g-om Penjya Njeto, which are strikingly different from the roads with the indents and the pits which were earlier in this place.</seg>
<seg id="17">The plates with his name are hanging on the modern building of the sport center and in the interactive impressing museum dedicated to climatic changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We connect the hopes of the real and serious changes to it", is saying his friend and from the institutional-revolutionary party (PRI) being headed by Penjya Njeto the political ally is Gabriel Oljvera Ehrnandes, the congressman of the staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We are expecting the real and decisive changes first of all in the field of security which are so sharply necessary for our country and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 of continuous stay at authority the party PRI was forced out by Visente Foksom in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Oljvera will recognize, that after it the party is putting 12 summer absences from the presidential palace Los-Pinos high hopes of Ehnrike Penjya Njeto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, it is refuting the accusations of vacuity which an opposition put forward to the new president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is really rectilinear and is betrayed to the matter of the realization of his sight of future really the countries.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, the person that can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But in another part of the staff many people developed another conception about the former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The municipal administration Nesaualjkoijotlj, well known also under name Sjyudad-Nesa, yavlyaet with himself the most striking contrast with the paved streets Valje-de-Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under the overpasses of the highways, it in many senses is a suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Also the problems are also carrying the severe character of this megapolicy in the municipal administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is for usmireniya of gangs which are dealing in the drugs in these districts earlier in this year, the troops were drawn; and the violence with regard to the women has a here especially sharp character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On the wasteland a few dozens bodies of the women's dead were discovered directly by the vast dump only in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than a thousand women were killed by Mexico City in staff during the governorate of Mr Penjya Njeto - this exceeds the similar index in the town Sjyudad-Xuares which was sadly famous for violence the name of which became common after the speech is touching on the murder of the innocent women considerably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to the opponents of Mr Penjya Njeto, one can speak about it in better case, that during his stay in the governor's post it could not to manage the problem of the women's murder.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst after all case they are accusing his administration of full ignoring of this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The inhabitant of concrete house, similar to the majority of the houses in this decayed district, Irineya Buehndiya is holding back her tears with difficulty, showing me the photographs of its late daughter Mariany the Moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">On Mariana official version in 2010 I/you/she carried out the suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">However her family thinks that her roommate killed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I reached her house, it "looked that" they "washed her body" in front of this" Mrs Buehndiya remembers.</seg>
<seg id="38">Signs that they beat it were, and the body has already grown numb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The mother of Mariany is retelling this history, and the daughter's portrait looks on us from the wall, where it is hanging next to the crucifix on which one word in total is traced: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">Namely this was denied, in their words, to this family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"The officials of the staff treated me as with the old gossip, dissatisfied naruwiteljniceij of calmness.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want the people simply to take on faith that they are speaking, and dipped all.</seg>
<seg id="43">But this is wrong, it is so not right, in particular when all around so much violations and shortages is", she is speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After putting on the presidential sling on Saturday, president Penjya Njeto together with it will claim difficult responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years dozens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected the crimes connected to a violence, and the new president promised to make the solution to this problem priority during his management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">I "hope that it will be the same president in an exact way to what was a governor" speaks Oljvera, the congressman from Valje-de-Bravo from the party PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However families of the victims are most of all afraid namely of this in Sjyudad-Nesa.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of the national self-determination a story of the American of the Mexican origin is.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans had to abandon Mexico due to the absence of the opportunities to realize himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left because they are reminding the inhabitants of the country of the complicated times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navarette thinks that the Mexicans of the American origin are torn among two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During the recent trip to Mexico City I fit through the corridor for the arriving ones, approached the zone of the border control and congealed on the spot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The signs pointed out two lines: one for Mexicanos (the Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (the foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I have been before them for a few seconds not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I appeared in central California, also me all the life named a Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is a simply conditional name, like a volume, as my friends in Boston they are calling themselves Irishmen, and the friends from New York consider themselves to be Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">I later dwelled on a complicated construction "American of the Mexican origin".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But I was in Mexico here.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was no need of conditional names or complicated constructions, here, in my grandfather's home.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simple as an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am speaking Spanish sufficiently well in order to ask the questions or it to answer them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary is poorer than with the native speakers, and I can not get rid of American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore I got my American passport and became for line for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered this history a few days back after the elected president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto again visited the White House and met with president Obamoij.</seg>
<seg id="18">Questions which are usual for the meetings of the presidents of these countries stood on an agenda: immigration, the drugs and commerce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">President Penjya Njeto spoke about the raising of the Mexican economy thanks to which Mexicans are now, with the same success voluntarily, they will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of crossing over to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude the agreement about partnership with the USA and Canada and to create certain north-American trade block similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, president Penjya Njeto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, however any concrete proposals did not sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico of the relationship with the United States is heavy and carried out old insults a question.</seg>
<seg id="23">The majorities of the Americans were never thoughtful about that that in 1848 the United States invaded a Mexico and forced her leaders to refuse half of their territory under the mouth of the guns.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the Mexicans think centuries, and not minutes, they also see reminding of those events in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore it is it only to some statesman of the USA to obmolvitjsya at least with the word of the critique in the direction of Mexico worth, in press and among the elite of the Mexican society after all the complaints on the Americans being encroaching upon the neighbors' sovereignty are heard here.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also the descendants Montesumy preispolnyayutsya with bellicosity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">At the same time relationships of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin living in the USA are most complicated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about insults?</seg>
<seg id="29">They are enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also those for whom such possibilities are not here winners and losers, people who find possibilities in this country for themselves in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or Dignity Anthony so many people of the Mexican origin only according to one reason: in some anybody - the father or the grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize himself in Mexico the moment of their family history and had to set out to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">These were mostly Mexicans of the certain type - the dark-skinned small-formed of poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are recalling this.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico they see this otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today our life is the realization of the American dream, we were studying in the good schools and we established ourselves at a good work, but it will not be possible for us to forget that, that even this dream is American, and not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination is confused and is unclear, but we know what country to consider its.</seg>
<seg id="37">United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Moreover we know that the majorities of the representatives of Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We are answering them like the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see reminding of humiliating defeats in me and are related to us as to the people of second type, as to the unreal Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are speaking Spanish insufficiently well, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence even is being explained by failures for them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would not have turned up behind the silk curtain after finding full life in the USA, but after losing the spiritual touches now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Gvadalaxare and I/you/she legally moved in the USA already in childhood, and this is reminding about among the real Mexicans and the Americans of the Mexican origin certain disputes existing me - the Mexicans more precisely understand their national identity, and the Americans of the Mexican origin are finding this vexing.</seg>
<seg id="46">It the citizen of the USA and he thinks that it belongs to both of these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time many my familiar Americans of the Mexican origin do not feel accessories not to one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We are listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but like also Bryusa Springstina.</seg>
<seg id="49">Receiving the better of two peaces, you are inevitably losing the roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the USA they are calling us Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I cleared up during my trip as if our relationships without that are insufficiently tangled immediately some Mexican leaders and the representatives of the intellectuals want to restore the relationships with diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans of the Mexican origin to work svoego roda as ambassadors of Mexico and interests to introduce it in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could have told our friends American about that, which this the beautiful country and they could also have convinced the political leaders to strengthen the connections with Mexico as it to healthily be visited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Aga, final.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing will come out.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too Many insults in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">BUT taking into consideration break among rich and poor, the revelry of corruption and narkotorgovli, many of us not at all think this country such a grass snake beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="59">Excuse, but understand themselves this, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Also this is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If the Mexicans' part can not forgive the United States' that up to now, they treated Mexico as them one and a half centuries ago, they will have to take on also that fact, what some Americans of the Mexican origin still in insult because of that, as quite recently they turned out with their relatives in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It really yes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe, with us much in common seemed than me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles in the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The agreement on the cease-fire among Israel and Xamas grouping becomes can fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Is the long-term peace possible among the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed encourages to conclusion concerning the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Are heard, the disputes becoming usual, absurd about the one who began the first; the mass of the buildings are turned into the ruins; 140 Palestinians most of whom civilians, and six Israelis put together are killed; for the first time during conflict, the rockets that were let out from the territory of the Gaza Strip fell down in the environments of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the sacred Jerusalem town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However in spite of the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians got stuck in their immemorial conflict, on the Middle East hopelessly came the changes.</seg>
<seg id="7">One can belong to this differently, however the events of "the Arabic spring" twirled in the rebellious storm the mass of the real facts which stabilized, the Israelis and also the Palestinian was not managed to stay in the side from whirl, shook the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Possible, as a result, the earlier their fight will become even more sanguinary.</seg>
<seg id="9">However reasons which give hope on an exit from this fatal dead end exist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without the winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The situation which at first developed does not give causes for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire will be fulfilled the agreement on which was signed on 21st November, the clashes which occurred this week only strengthened the positions of the workers from both of the sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Islamist Xamas movement coming to the authority in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will declare from their forcing Israel to recede from view, despite the losses that were suffered by them.</seg>
<seg id="14">In spite of the fact that they were destroyed some leaders of the grouping, and blockaded 1.7 million the inhabitants in one of the most densely populated and problem corners of our planet, Israel did not manage to destroy Xamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a matter of fact Xamas is growing its popularity in the West Bank - yet another Palestinian territory which is checked by the more moderate movement Fatx at present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Furthermore, the leaders can Xamas completely come to the conclusion that the time works for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the growth of the influence of the Islamist movements Arabic peace at Xamas emerge the new influential and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The regional reviving leader appeared Turkey which once was the nearest ally of Israel among the Moslem countries with a support Xamas; Qatar, one of the richest states and the dynamically developing states of Persian Gulf, followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="19">The triumphing supporters declare is Xamas about the creation around Israel of Islamist half a month from Lebanon in the north in which a paramilitary grouping Xezbolla is governing, to Syria in which the always более pro-Islamists rebels will overthrow the authority Assad's Bawara any moment and then to Jordan, where Xamasa allies are threatening the king's authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most considerable change of the balance of the forces in the region occurred on the southern boundaries of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arabic country, in Egypt, where in front of president Mohammed Mursi the influence of the movement became stronger the Brothers Moslem.</seg>
<seg id="21">Xosni Mubarak who has governed Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator not paying a particular attention to support Xamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The brothers Moslem are organization, on the contrary, in many respects similar from Xamas, but their leaders are inclined to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomatic arrangements Xamas becomes can an important player whose voice even Israel and America will not manage to muffle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time the supporters of the "hard" line will come to the opposite conclusions in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="25">In war sense Xamas be poverzhen.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli antimissile "Iron cupola" system justified the outlay on her creation and successfully destroyed many of neglected Xamas of the rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the USA remained true its fixed position; many European countries also put the blame in the beginning of the last round of violence on the Xamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">An economic prosperity of Israel is another important factor, in the peculiarity under the government of Netanyahu's Binjyamina who ignored the peace process to a considerable degree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In spite of the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis died of the rockets turned out from the territory of the Gaza Strip Israel managed to reduce the condemned man-terrorists' problem to the minimum, partly at the expense of the wall which is dropping by the territory of the West Bank - the considerable part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to expand despite the unlawfulness of such actions from the point of view of international legislation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Netanyahu's prime minister whose party is Likud within the framework of preparation for the elections which were planned for the 22nd January - I/you/she united with the conservatives even more aggressively more incited under leadership of Avigdora Libermana, I/you/she is extremely convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What sense in pandering to the Palestinians and giving to them is its own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If to give all the authority in the territory of the West Bank to their hands, did they begin to launch the missile from there in the direction of Israel as their co-workers are doing this in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to hold them behind the wall and to overwhelm hard just any attempt to pick up the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It is possible, the supporters of the "hard" line will gain victory; however their calculations can be refuted by the Arabic spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Under that, that the Islamists are testing who are coming to power in Egypt and other countries not the warmest feelings towards Israel, inner problems will become their priority task.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense part of the budget of Israel is greater than at all his Arabic neighbors taken together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The unbundling of the war against regional superpower will scarcely help the governments of the Arabic countries to strengthen their own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Mursi which jointly worked on cease-fire with Barak Obamoij is good sign and can mark himself the beginning of changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, into not smaller degree, it has to take the long-term consequences of his policy into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the onset of the democratic changes in the Arabic countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is the time bomb which will burst in the territories that were being occupied by Israel sooner or later, like the bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repressions already undermine the principles of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect - the growth of the Arabic population - it is redoubling these problems only.</seg>
<seg id="43">One has to pay for the sanguinary operations which are being conducted in the territory of the Gaza Strip for the suppression of the Xamas movement every a few years in the growing dissatisfaction of the international association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both of the sides are needing an external impulse</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The only decision which the sensible representatives from both of the sides are incessantly calling to remains, as well as the big part of the remaining one is a target and our newspaper: the formation of two states and concession by Israel of the territories in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, not the too impressive one in short-term perspective, does not remain - the hope cease-fire allowing the other countries to influence the sides of conflict more efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Are to Egypt which for a long time it has been for time to make the decision to cover the deliveries of the weapons to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar available as never, advantage in order that to convince Xamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish state taken from 1967 with the account-taking of the exchange of the territories and the resource sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The other Arabic countries also have to apply the efforts to the reconciliation of Xamas movements and Fatx.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would have done more for the creation of the Palestinian state than the vote lying ahead in the UN the result of which an acknowledgment of the virtual nationhood of Palestine becomes can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Also president Obama has to play his role in usaditj Israel behind the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first period it tak i ne did not present his own plan of the peace settlement.</seg>
<seg id="52">After return to the White House it has been showing as before the reluctance to be joined to the solution to the present problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is a catastrophically shortsighted position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States vitally are interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in the event of the peace agreement among Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="3">The first in world practice Australian law on the packaging of the cigarettes and the tobacco products of the same kind came into effect replacing the logotypes and the colored get-up of the different marks the equal cardboard box in a melancholy way-оливкового цвета with the weird photos of the parts of the body struck by the illness and the children's representations the health of which their parents' smoking podorvano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Apart from different pictures and the inscriptions that are giving advance notice of the harm of smoking the only distinction between the bundles brought in obligatory order since this Saturday is the titles of the marks which are printed by the equal small font.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are the most severe in the peace of condition for the get-up of the packagings of the tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Federal Government of Australia is declaring, what is the goal of this measure to keep young people from smoking, the lichen this harmful habit of the stylish status.</seg>
<seg id="7">Results of the researches that showed served as a basis for such a decision what the people, begun to smoke up to 26 years, in 99 cases from 100 so never and they are not becoming smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It "is evident, that the children understand even at a youngest age" a Health Secretary Tatyana Plibersek is explaining "the sense which is trying to bring the tobacco companies with the help of the get-up of the packaging", referring to the researches that showed that, for example, the crown is being associated with the princess' idea in logotype with the children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the least in the peace of the smokers' shares so these changes will not effect the profit of the transnational corporations especially, however also the other countries have already discussed the possibility of the acceptance of the similar measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The representatives of the tobacco industry strengthenedly counteracted the passage of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies assert that this will only increase the share of the black market in which the cheap and accessible cigarettes will be sold.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those, who were thoughtful his initiators", Skott Makintaijr, the representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia, is counting.</seg>
<seg id="13">The producers of counterfeit production of China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for the sale in the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For somebody the new laws contribute to the growth of business, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Xa from small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd asserts, what the demand for cigarette cases and silikonovye cases, hidden the unpleasant pictures on the packaging, I/you/he precipitantly appeared (from practically zero) ever since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the matter in the high court of Australia, to appeal where tried present law.</seg>
<seg id="16">In words Sandry Xa, company Zico already realized the order of six thousand products the wholesale establishments and he is expecting the new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A popularity of the social nets among namely that part of the population which these measures are directed towards is potential disturbance for the effectiveness of the similar measures, according to the experts.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the acceptance there are cigarettes in a conspicuous place in Australia of the series of laws, the sport measures that made illegal the television commercial of the cigarettes and the support with them, as well as prohibiting to the sellers from putting out, the advertisement of the tobacco products moved in Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The government of Australia prohibited to local companies and the web sites from putting the advertisement in a net, but it can not limit the foreign sites to this.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you are dealing in the tobacco products and only this small loophole remained with you, the idea to move its product will seem extremely tempting to you in internet", Beki Friman is explaining investigating matters of public health in the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Frimen is noting the growth of the number of the reviews on trade marks written from the person of the supposedly average users, in such social nets as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">A question arises: this is really a handiwork of the row citizen who that I/you/he did not feel sorry for the forces and the time and videorolik made, or behind this an advertising agency is likes the cigarettes Marlboro so much?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian department of the company British American Tobacco asserts that now in branch more are taken up by the adjustment to new rules than by the advertisement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the contestation of the new rules: these states are expressing the dissatisfactions within the framework of World Trade Organization reporting that that the commerce was exposed unjust restrictions, in spite of the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are extremely unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision of the WTO is being expected to the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Tatyana Plibersek, the government discussed the possibility of the passage by them of the analogous laws on the packaging with some other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001 Canada of first brought the obligatory allocation of the photographs that are giving advance notice of the harm of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now this rule is taken on in more than 40 countries, among them in Brasilia, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of the stiffening of the laws is being discussed in Great Britain, New Zealand, SA and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The great number of the smokers in Australia is demonstrative do not obey the innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures do not touch me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I am simply not turning attention.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">To be bored in the peace of electronic nets and the constant connections is not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On this Day of thanksgiving I suddenly have had to spend five hours in the airport because the mechanical disagreement happened to our plane and replaced it with another plane which we also waited for.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this way, I had enough time on reflections about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not deceive you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day in the airport in the expectation of flight is really boring, and here neither the books, nor the magazines, neither iPhone, nor even the shops of the free trade, will strongly help.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However recently more and more learned ones and specialists in children's development are speaking out for the benefit of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They are saying which to be bored not so bad in certain situations for us and for our children.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is forcing its brain to be distracted on interesting adjacent topics, that contributes to creation, possibly.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in so far as there are constantly we all in front of some screen in the modern peace, the advantages of boredom are going past us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Perhaps for us necessary strive to boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also at the same time it no not no.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will still return to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Earlier I, as well as many, I/you/she thought that boredom is the invention about the recent times, when with the people more spare time has appeared.</seg>
<seg id="15">This not so, the author of the book "Fascinating history" of boredom" is asserting Piter of Thuya, the professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"As a matter of fact boredom can really brag about ancient history", he is saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in Pompeyax the Latin inscriptions about boredom are discovered, dated the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At the same time the question about how we understand boredom remains open.</seg>
<seg id="19">Problem in that, a John is speaking D. Istvud, the associate professor of the University Ijork in Ontario, Canada, what understanding and the sight of boredom changed often.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After studying the materials of the researches on this topic and zadav a question to goal group into 100 people, the professor of Istvud and his co-worker came to the next definition: boredom is when the people "want, but they are not able to do what would bring them a satisfaction".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and apathy, he is speaking, consists in that that the person being bored is not doing something, that I/you/he would want to make.</seg>
<seg id="22">It not to do anything with apathy is not desirable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Main thing is in the boredom to be experienced, he is saying, this "the violation of attention and connected to this the deterioration of mood and the sensation that the time is stretching slowly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On description boredom can seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However professor Istvud asserts that the people being bored despite the possible connection between these states, see the causes of the problems in the environment and circumstances, and the people who are experiencing a depression see the problems in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that it is boring for us when as a matter of fact it is for us simply difficult to concentrate on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its research there is "Unoccupied reason: the definition of the boredom from the point of view of attention", refer published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor Istvud with the co-workers on the experiment more conducted earlier the participants of which listened to the recording of the voice that is reading magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">One participants also heard the loud sounds of the television program not belonging to a matter included in the neighboring room, the other ones heard the same sounds on the low one loudness, so one hardly could analyze them, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without the foreign sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants, who heard a television from loudness level low, they were noting, that they found boring, is more frequent than the other ones - it it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know reason this and they were attributing this to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we are trying to concentrate attention on a difficult or fascinating task, the interruption of attention can cause boredom, Mark of J is saying. Fenske, the associate professor of the neurology in the Guelph's University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the present research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"For example, on the other hand, "looking at the stream of the products on the conveyor belt in the search of the marriage the diverting music can help to avoid boredom" after we are doing uninteresting something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">He is taking into consideration, it continues, that when the people begin to rock on the chair or draw the caraculs on the sheet of paper, they are doing this from boredom, we now however know, that as a matter of fact such actions help not to grow weak physically simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The research showed that the children who they are not forbidding to fidget and to rotate are studying better and remember more information than the children who are demanding to sit quietly of" is asserting professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">At some all the moments we have felt boredom: on the delay of flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech glancing through the uninteresting film.</seg>
<seg id="35">However different people are showing a different degree of the penchant for boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 1980 for the measurement of such individual specifics the researchers worked "the special scale of the penchant for boredom" out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For example, questions and assertions are being used for the definition of the grade in such a scale "a great deal from what my having to make is monotonous and monotonous" or "For me "too a great deal interesting, therefore the time does not suffice for anything".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such questionnaires the researchers determined that the boys are bored more often than the girls, is saying Stiven Vodanovich, the professor of the psychology in the University of Western Florida, - in peculiarity in the presence of the diverse external irritants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In general, however as a whole teenagers are often bored.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 Rid Larson, the professor of the personal and social development in the University of Illinois, conducted the experiment in the course of which he was involved with the help of the beeper hardly with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">It received the following results: 32% of the teenagers reported that they are finding boring in the school and reported that during the fulfillment of homework, and 23% that they are finding boring beyond the limits of the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">At the same time only 3% of the parents noted that it is boring for them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data about what similar data about boredom would soon be 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mainly however he knows that "the peak of the penchant for boredom is falling on podrostkovyij age" because they are not allowing the children and the teenagers to decide to the complete extent that to deal them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">We will return to my initial question: is boredom useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it no not no because in extreme manifestations she can encourage the people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, some risky reckless games or the abuse of certain substances in the attempts to get rid of boredom as they show the researches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and the writers were thoughtful about the connection between boredom and creation, is saying professor Vodanovich having devoted more than two decades to the research of this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Like that our brain explains to us that one should begin another something; this is also boredom", is saying Gehri Markus, the professor of psychology, in the New York university.</seg>
<seg id="49">However he has always not known his this very brain, to be done namely better.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you will find boring and will direct this energy towards the playing on the guitar or some culinary experiences, will do for yourselves better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However if you will watch a television, for you will become is better only for some time, and soon this will go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Therefore, if your child is bored and you are giving him iPad, it will stop being bored, however he will not learn to fight boredom with another way to operate its time and employment independently or somehow, professor Fenske is speaking.</seg>

<seg id="54">Your child is learning not only independently to keep himself with something busy, he is also studying self-control, in general.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that it is necessary somehow to prevoznositj boredom.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Istvud is agreeing with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We see this so that we should feel boredom more often under that that boredom is the extremely unpleasant, unquenchable wish to begin something sensible", he is speaking.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">While it is incomprehensible as the new law on the legalization of marihuana will be used in the staff of Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ehntoni is Orosko, the nineteen-year-old player of the football team and the student of the public college in the southeast of the staff of Colorado is accused of the accomplishment of the criminal offense that consists in that that soon it will be absolutely legal in the whole territory of the staff: the storage of the small portion of marihuana and pipe in which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">G-n Orosko says that once the friends and it was in Lamare in September and went directly by the border between Kansas in the car on the prairie when the police officers stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer discovered marihuana in the car, Mr Orosko got a writ of summons for the storage of the drugs and possession of adaptation for the use of the drugs - the small infringements for each of which the penalty at the rate of 100 dollars is owed - and the date of the legal proceedings is fixed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treat us as with the criminals", is saying Mr Orosko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But the criminal is really it?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty which has continued already for a few weeks after the staff of Colorado voted for the legalization of the use of the marihuana in the small quantities for entertainment the decision of the hundreds of the small cases depends not so much on a law, as on the place of examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The accusations of the small infringements connected to marihuana are already taken off in hundreds of cases here also in the Washington staff which took analogous measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police stations have stopped already putting forward accusations the people for the storage of low doses at the age of 21, which will be considered legal as soon as in a couple of weeks the law will come into effect, in an also older way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However in the more conservative districts of Colorado the accusers made the decision to discuss the existing matters connected to marihuana draw and on former to responsibility for the storage of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time they are voting on the West in some towns from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous districts behind not admitting the appearance in their places of the shops new, licensed by the staff on the sale of the marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">All this "is developing so precipitantly that I do even not know" what "waiting for is further", is saying Dehniel of J. In the small town Avrora is Outs, a chief of police in the east from Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The representatives of the inspectorates are also in a staff of Washington the heads is puzzled pochesyvayut.</seg>
<seg id="14">They have to form the rules for the definition of the procedure of the licensing of the raising, the processing, the spreading and the sale of the marihuana, and it is necessary to do all this until December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are speaking, what Colorado, this is good or bad, most of other staff is overtaking for medical purposes, but now for entertainment in the settlement of matters of use of marihuana, at first.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"There is a more regulated market in Colorado, therefore they will serve as a good example", is explaining Braijan I. Smit, the representative of Counsel on the control of production and the market of alcoholic production is in a staff of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can do more, Mr Smit recognizes, to move out some proposals and to hope that this will start up like what.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We do not have any real precedent which we could orient ourselves towards", he is saying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill of the staff of Washington named by I-502 will enter due to the 6th December and will drive the staff into the state of uncertainty when the system of the state licensing has not been here yet for whole year, and right of possession is already legalized by the marihuana.</seg>
<seg id="20">BUT the complicated technical aspects have still existed, however, which is necessary to solve in this period, for example, how find equilibrium among the disposal of the staff about "adequate access" to licensed marihuana with prohibition of trade of it in the distance of 1000 feet from the schools, the parks, the play grounds and the nursery schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">He will especially complicatedly put the licensed the commerce with marihuana in the boundary of the towns, in particular in Seattle businesses and it the suburbs", Ben Livingston is explaining, the representative created recently research group "Center of the legalization of marihuana".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21st November the chief of police Outs has distributed the message about that that the Public Prosecutor's Office of the town will not draw her persons any more, attaining the age 21 to his subordinates by e-mail of Avrory for a year, to responsibility for property, and what stops with the small quantity of marihuana police to accuse people of some present violations "starting in this moment".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief of police Outs announced that the police will follow the observance in the town of the rules regulating the activity of the persons, for medical purposes raising marihuana, and will pursue illegal merchants and the spreaders of the drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The district attorney Uehld in the north of Colorado, Tank Ken, is presenting a stricter approach for this question.</seg>
<seg id="25">After vote on bill he declared, that the Public Prosecutor's Office will hold for a possession of marihuana responsible as before, mainly in order that to incite the using ones to complete the course of treatment her faces.</seg>
<seg id="26">At present moment the accusations of the storage of two and less than ounces of marihuana are made to 119 persons although many of them are being accused also of some other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I/you/he said, "the duty of our institution is to pursue because of the actions which are considered criminal at the moment of their accomplishment", Mr the Tank in its statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was ambiguous even in such places as the village district Mesa, where the participants of the vote turned down the proposal about the legalization of marihuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Grandee police of Dzhankwn, city even in the neighborhood, it is not holding the majors for a property responsible any more the small quantity of drug.</seg>
<seg id="30">The district public prosecutor Pit Xautcinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take off the accusations in already open matters connected to the storage of marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I am counting, what an observance of the law to provide as long as while it will not be changing is our direct duty", he is saying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of the fact that 55% of the inhabitants of the staff of Colorado taking part in the vote kept up this decision, switching on of matters of use of the marihuana for entertainments into state and legal system will not be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reaction of the inhabitants in different places of the staff bared the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to the experiment of the staff with marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">He is explaining, "In this question the district public prosecutors exists a cultural barrier", Won Makalister, the denverskiij lawyer that is presenting the convicts' interests for the storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of the reform of laws for marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have been persecuting people because of this so for a long time that now they properly can come to terms with that that this is already not crime", he is speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">To Colorado and to Washington - the first staff in which belong to the small quantity of marihuana just as as to alcohol - is predestined to become the experimental field on the scales of the country for the check of the very idea of the legalization of the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">The supporters of legalization and the officials of the staff are planning on enlarging the territory of the legalized commerce, but at the same time they with care wait instructions from federal the authorities which have been planning as before on considering the sale and the raising of marihuana as federal crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The supporters of the legalization of marihuana hope that judicial authority will be inferior in this question.</seg>
<seg id="39">For medical purposes despite a few good gave the cases receiving the wide resonance of the arrests of the merchants and the patients, using marihuana on medical evidences, the Federal Government in majority on a commerce with marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The agents of the Office for the fight against the drugs will scarcely burst into the houses in order to confiscate the small packet of marihuana, however they will almost shut their eyes to the shops of the recreational marihuana which new law is resolved, Kevin A. Sabet is counting, the former adviser on matters of fight against the drugs is in the administration Obamy being regulated by the authorities of the staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some towns did not wait for the activities of the federal authorities in Colorado.</seg>
<seg id="42">Already before the presidential elections some local administrations approved the moratorium for the opening of the new shops on the sale of the marihuana which anyhow would not have managed to open earlier than in a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Montrouz, the town in the western part of the staff, put forward on the examination six-month prohibition of trade with marihuana, which, in all probability, will be approved a next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to turn up in such a position that we will deliver a license to somebody, but then this will cause the serious problems at the federal level", is saying Bob Nikolson, member of town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our town voted against this correction.</seg>
<seg id="46">Also now with us the contradiction between the results of the local vote and that what a staff voted for is available.</seg>
<seg id="47">Still very many unresolved problems are left behind.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Uaijehtt: they survived me from Oxford behind my being a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">The pursuits of the students of the universities behind their looks began not today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">How much I remember myself, I always dreamed to act to the Oksfordskiij university.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and my older brother were studying in Oxford and an educational establishment, a modern counterpart of the ancient symposium imparting two principles of civilization were describing it as the better one in the peace - freedom of thought and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Both nevertheless, two weeks later studies are on the historic faculty of the Vusterskogo college of the Oksfordskogo university at the end of the eightieth, I gathered the suitcases and I/you/she went away as what developed into the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father did not withstand and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard asserted that I gave up the college because I did not like that my odnokursniki are dealing with sex in the neighboring room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer Eh. the Norman Uilson was playing around, that I left because I had to drink out of the qerbatyx cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">As a matter of fact everything was not funnily so.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I/you/she ran because they systematically etched me and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not at all due to my quite unusual name or that that I was studying in the private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">They etched me only according to one reason, and in this cradle of prosveqennosti brought glory to this looked like real cruelty and a blind fanaticism: my father, nowadays was late Vudro Uaijehtt, a well known adviser Margaret Tehtcher, also I myself was the conservatives' adherent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Will you ask why after all to remember this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the last data, the students' new generation keeping to right-centrist views is exposed to the same hunting.</seg>
<seg id="17">This hatred institutionalized and constantly growing against the students-conservative in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same defense of its rights as that which is being granted to the invalids, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The conservatives are declaring their Body Kristi from the student club of the college in Cambridge, what them "actively isolate often, subject to personal attacks and they are forcing to feel like undesirable guests" due to their political looks.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to bring the additional representative to the committee according to equal rights of the college in order to provide the freedom of the expression of their opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The documentary about the politician in student Wednesday which left 2 to BBC recently redoubled their situation only "The wonderland: young, smart and right", in which they introduced the conservatives the eccentrics and the neonazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">A film was shown in by Dzho Kuk, the former president of the Association of the conservatives of the Oksfordskogo university which is going in rolls-roijse is taking a silver suit and the walking stick with the silver knob.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities the students conservative are complaining, that of them they do "the scapegoats due to the rise in the charge for studies".</seg>
<seg id="23">The hatch of Blehk, 20 years, the vice-president of the Association of the conservatives of the Nottingemskogo university, in the interview of one of Sunday newspapers said that "in university Wednesday the warp in the direction of the left looks is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people who do even not know us consider us to be impertinent beforehand also with impunity the parents, rich in the wild children".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Sehmyuehl Roberts, 21 years, the student of the historic faculty of the college the Body Kristi in whom the petition about the intensification of the defense was given calls such an atmosphere "comfortless", but Stefani Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the conservatives' Association of the university Oksfordskogo, he says that the relationship of the members of the student club to the carriers of the right-centrist looks worsened considerably.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the threat both for the atmosphere of the intellectual discussion and simply for normal life of the members of the club", she is saying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">A few first weeks in Oxford I was not simple in minority, I was alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered there in September 1986, the shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excited Oxford from hatred against the conservative party.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a year before this the university deprived with vote the alumna Margaret Tehtcher of her honorary degree due to the reduction of the budget allocations by university education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere it would be even comfortless stalinistam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Into the freshman's first weekdays, after the students are meeting themselves and the lecturers, I felt that expected me ahead for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="33">I have not known yet that the lecturers turned a blind eye not only to the conservative-students' hunting, however, took themselves part in it with pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The political questions are the miners' strike, a privatization and the disagreement of the government: the sanctions against the government of apartheid to be used in SA they penetrated through the walls of the auditories sheathed by the wooden panels.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first seminar I should translate the French text of the eighteenth century into the English, and I was not ready to what followed this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Uaijehtt, is a lecturer said, nowadays the late Garri Pitt, please, translate the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">The text came to me with difficulty, I faltered.</seg>
<seg id="38">Garri Pitt was person, similar to the cake, and a very gall person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Tehtcheristy is fundamental do not teach the French or the brains" do not "suffice" for them simply?" - he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students began to giggle.</seg>
<seg id="41">With me in front of the eyes tears appeared.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I am advising you to take a few initial French lessons to a spare time if, of course, you are not not really busy revolving in society": Pitt probryuzzhal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned absolutely unhappy to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">In that evening in the college I sat alone at dinner; then somebody slapped me on his shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">This was James, the student of second course from the faculty of English who appeared as his member of the Association of the conservatives of the university.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you, is he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> - Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">above each, who they are suspecting of likings for the conservatives, they will scoff.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me myself is difficult, and in your case they know, that your father is close to Margaret Tehtcher, therefore will be you more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majorities of the freshmen conservative are pretending, that they are Labourites".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, I tried to dissemble in a cowardly way.</seg>
<seg id="52">I was insisting on that that I/you/she is not agreeing with all, that Margaret Tehtcher is speaking.</seg>
<seg id="53">Slyness did not turn out well.</seg>
<seg id="54">The freshman of the faculty of the philosophy, the politicians and the economies, studied which himself in Itone, said: "You are the daughter of the fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are infectious".</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students joined in his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was spoiled, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How are the conservatives dealing with sex? - One of them asked.</seg>
<seg id="59"> - They are beating each other, really?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so, as, probably, the homosexuals felt before the abolition of the prosecution in the sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">Will I be able to live for normal life in Oxford sometime?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or will I have to meet with the like-minded persons only under the cover of the night?</seg>
<seg id="63">I will really be must to become leijboristkoij and to hide its present convictions?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years which lie ahead of me have started seeming like the hell, complete of the persecutions and solitude.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Norman Stoun, the professor of modern history, was the only lecturer not hiding his conservative views in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">They hated it not only for accessories for the conservatives, however, behind that, that it was an adviser Tehtcher on matters of foreign policy also to one of her spichraijterov.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the college it did practically not appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">It despised it for provincialjnostj, pettiness and adherence marksistsko-deterministskomu view on history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he took on the professorial post in the university Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you will not be happy", he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started going to Oxford from the parental home in London trying to find the refuge among the relatives and the unpreconceived metropolitan friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not confide to me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies just any political look was being accepted in the forties there.</seg>
<seg id="75">"However, just the same the better university in the peace , - he said mournfully.</seg>
<seg id="76"> - There of such a are not capable, only not in the town of the dozing capstans...</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends-communist always behaved irreproachably".</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes became cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="79">Do not make the hurried decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am convinced, that this is simple jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">You will break my heart "if you will give up the university".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was worn out by the constants the trips to London and my emotional defense weakened.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also the conservative, did not withstand the pressure and refused his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">A next week during seminar, when the next lecturer of history absolutely seriously named me "an enemy of the people", I decided to act just as.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the shower burning from shame, I confessed, what "washed out for me "the brains the parents", I/you/she also named them "dotards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The breather was brief.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford was to drive ordained by fate my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote two columns each for the editions which belong to Rupertu Merdoku every week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I did not leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up themselves.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, after all I gathered the suitcase and the villages on the first the train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">Tak i ne I did not return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me a cry-baby and a rag.</seg>
<seg id="94">But at the age of eighteen years no one has to become the object of such a spite and the intimidations in the educational establishment.</seg>
<seg id="95">That pechaljnee, that this was Oxford which not only turned out fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, however, which is hiding po seij denj behind the undeserved reputation of the university which they value equality and freedom of thought in.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The most difficult occupation is in the peace: the miners with Kavax-Idzhena</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros the Indonesian miners are risking life and health pulling 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of the volcano along the steep stony paths</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is hell, and the other ones literally work in a hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them Anto Vidzhaijya, one of 400 miners who are earning sulphur with the loot for living in the volcano Kavax-Idzhen located in the east of the Indonesian Java island, is.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day Anto goes down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulphurous gas which is rising from the depths of the Earth congeals with contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After unpinning the huge pieces of sulphur the total weight of which can reach 70 kg he is putting them in two bambukovye baskets, is loading baskets on his shoulders and is carrying them upward along the steep stony road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano the height of which is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters however the emaciated loaders needed more than 40 minutes, in order to get up turtle step, retaining equilibrium with difficulty and feeling carefully the road in order it is not possible to stumble and it is not possible to fall down from the precipice.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one false step can cost them life as this happened to one tourist from France who broke out of the rocks Kavax-Idzhena a few years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Kavax-Idzhena and the miner earn 5 evrocentov in every kilogram of sulphur which they are obtaining</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">After turning up above, they are paving themselves road between the tourists who are photographing them how if they were monkeys from the circus and supporting the heavy baskets in a tired way three kilometers take a step to the scales which the mining company put hardly higher, at a height than 1,850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">The talk is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, the business, which has operated this volcano since 1960 and, it is better not to say either, its workers to whom he is paying 662 Indonesian rupees (5 evrocentov) for every kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then he is selling it for 10,000 rupees (83 evrocentov) the petrochemical productions, but this mineral is spread in everyday life and is being used for the manufacturing of the matches, the fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the lightening of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Since" пере wearing of 70 kilograms "is norm, we are earning" about 46,000 rupees "(3.8 euros) in each the walker", Anto who is normally fulfilling three daily oversocks is explaining to us.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has been wasting three hours on each of them and he feels at the end conclusion disabled, however they are allowing him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) towards the end of a day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems like mizerom for such a superhuman effort, this is three times greater than what it would earn in field is.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Daily pay the miners very high in local measurements, where they are paying 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) for the collection of coffee at a day and the average monthly payment is equal to two million rupees (167 a euro)" , - a loader is clarifying who worked as a mason earlier on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">His wages were 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day there and the area was not so difficult, but Anto returned with its family to Banjyuvangi, the small town close to the volcano, according to important reason, which is the same crushing one in Indonesia as sulphur: "I got married to the girl with Bali where one Hindus are, and brought it to Java, that she took on the Islam".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, it is breathing with difficulty, he is constantly coughing, and his eyes due to the toxic gases are streaming</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Into the own people 27 years Anto has led three years risking itself in Kavax-Idzhene whose sulphur has already begun to effect it despite the presence of the mask and the special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, it is breathing with difficulty, he is constantly coughing, and his eyes due to the toxic gases are streaming which a volcano is picking out.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is a price which he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">I "will still work" for two years:, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French", it is promising in the more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a porter in the hotel, but instead of this he is fulfilling the work of the mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing the dirty wooden shack with other porters, it gets up because sulphur does not stop flowing by night every day at two o'clock in the morning, when her characteristic yellow is turning into blue and it is sparkling among darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Throwing the call for shades, Anto is going down into the crater himself lighting a road with the small lamp connected to his helmet which he himself bought to his money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters are dragging the baskets with sulphur from the bottom of the volcano on their shoulders</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the loot of the sulphur for the saving of expenditures and is not granting any equipment to the porters who are working on their bill and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually, they are not producing even the part from 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the collection for the photography, which, together with the permit for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature reserve are collecting from the tourists who are coming in order to photograph the volcano and his people mule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This work for cattle, and not for the people", Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years who has led three decades on Kavax-Idzhene ever since the college abandoned, is declaring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable to pick up up to 110 kilograms, he is swearing, that he will suffer a work "so much, how much will be able", because he needs money for the education of his three children at the age from 18 up to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all of my lives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur burns the throat and the eyes when the wind is suddenly changing and he is catching the miners in the dense poles of smoke leaving the volcano, they are so much sturdy that no one is complaining about his difficult diseases... more serious, evident than their usual problems with breathing, artrozy, pains in knees and sores on the shoulders which became deformed under the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Only balancing the basket on the back, Unaijnik now 50 kilograms can raise 53 years into the own people.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day it and his comrades take out 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano which three trucks transport on the stockroom in Tamansari overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along the narrow path among the undergrowth.</seg>
<seg id="35">I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all of my lives" Unaijnik is declaring opening mouth in which a few teeth do not suffice widely.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of his five children, the boss, 30 years, he is also working as a transmitter of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">The time is passing, but poverty immortalizes from generation into generation one of the most difficult lessons in the peace: what human mules are teaching to Kavax-Idzhena.</seg>

<seg id="4">I the husband the patriot, you my wife the patriot, we will fulfill our civil duty and we will create life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It can seem improbable that these lines are the part of the advertisement of the mint pancakes, however became a hit despite this - or possibly thanks to this - this video in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">We "will put" rehpa, who "let's is kind of using local sayings "these phrases are part bao (the roll) into the stove", in order to laugh at the level of birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising agency which made this video, BBH is cherishing the hope that with the help of the advertisement they will manage to draw attention to the present problem in entertaining form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">His creative director, Duglas Hamilton, says that I/you/he wanted to use the power of the music that the people fulfilled their national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This thing exceptionally for internet, therefore we should make it cheerful and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are worst in the peace on reproduction himself similar, therefore we felt that this is that topic which we have to affect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew, that the government tried to do many things, to carry out the startup of the perfume with the pheromones for example or to organize the parties of the fast familiarity (blic-dates).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were kreativnymi, possibly, but optionally snapped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore we thought, why we will not be able to do the most samuyu kreativnuyu thing out of the possible ones in order to resolve the present problem, but namely create rehp?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who is not perceiving this is so thoughtless, this government of Singapore is so.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is spending 1,300 US dollars on the birth of the greater quantity of the children in a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for married couples and the parents grants up to 15,000 dollar on the child, is prolonging the vacation on pregnancy and the deliveries and provides tax abatement.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has low effectiveness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high technology state town in Southeast Asia, also well known in the conservatism of its instruction and in its strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">There is level of birth rate at the level of 1.2 children on the woman in Singapore, according to his national department on population, at present.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was lower than 2 - which is well known as the percentage of filling - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why singapurcy do not have the greater quantity of the children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Veij of Mines, the director of the Department of the policy on married couples and families of the National department on population, says that cause of that is "the improved education" and "the wider gamut of the career possibilities".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">This allowed the people the wider gamut of the versions in that, as for life goals and priorities, apart from the wedding and the creation of the family to be been available", she is explaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes of social norms contribute to the stature of the quantity of the bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the children's birth, why the level of birth rate came down in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the immigration policy which is directed towards the burst of the immigration for opposition to the decrease in population causes indignation among native population.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are web sites in Singapore where a xenophobia with regard to many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese who criticize for the maintenance of the wages on low level also the reluctance to be integrated being hardly hidden thrives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration is also looked at like one of the reasons of last year the ruling Singapore party receiving the worst result from the times of independence on elections.</seg>
<seg id="30">After elections an attempt to resolve the problem was, with the help of the quotas and some higher taxes for the foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall of birth rate provides the well known influence on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, the expenses for medicine and also begins to have the policy of immigration, the example of Singapore some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is exerting efforts that so much small habitation was not being built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, this began to influence the sector of real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The instruction in city development crossed the numbers of the small apartments, well known numbers to the control how "the shoe cardboard box", which one can build in certain districts of the town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are very well selling.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is the opinion that they can contribute to single way of life and are depriving the building contractors who want to build the big family habitation of their stimulus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the Lima Yu Sunj, the General Manager of the house-building firm EL Developers, says that their "shoe cardboard boxes" sell much more fast than the more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments will be sold of a few days, even weeks, more fast than the apartments of greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result of this our receipts are increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he recognizes that the new norms give the clearer landmarks for the building contractors who impediments helped earlier if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Overstrained too</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a town-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be the step in the direction of the increase of the national birth rate, after the conversation with singapurcami which work in the financial quarter of the center it seems that they will not have a particular effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are overstrained really, the habitation is expensive, also as well as education, also due to this many people they" are "laying" this aside, a young administrative official is speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have the children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But it is for me important its own money and the time to be available", has said another young man of 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The men and the women are mentioning their career, a stress and the prices of the habitation and the education as the reasons which prevent them from bringing the children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, in a quasi way the government was not trying to incite its citizens to the children's birth, in that, as for detorozhdeniya, the last word remains for singapurcami.</seg>

<seg id="39">Key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marjelos Porras, the lecturer of the English and the specialist in education and the teaching is, thinks that in order to direct children and teenagers it is necessary to understand what the goal of the social nets to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The internet appeared like resource for the search of the information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed", she is noting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras points out that also the author of the work is academician Mark Prenski, the skilled worker of the pedagogics from the Ijeljskogo university the Numerical aboriginals and the immigrants, invented these terms for the explanation of the present phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The numerical aboriginals this they, the children and young people who were born in the epoch of technologies.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital immigrants who have to learn them while we have still been studying themselves", she is saying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that this topic "is" complicated because we are asking them to have a certain criterion of the that what can either it is not allowed to extend, it to publish or it to speak, at the age, when ripeness does not suffice for this".</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also that they were electoral while it is the most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about consequences" she is adding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, to show the most effective way, that confidentiality the children and the teenagers , - to ask the questions which force them to contemplate.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Speaking with it that they did not do this, is useless", she is adding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras is listing some versions: there are things which you would not have told to the stranger so why you are doing this in internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or you would have liked, if they published a photograph you like that, which you about your friend published?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know, that the other ones are publishing for you?</seg>
<seg id="52">Are you asking other people for permissions, when you have been signing the photographs from the parties, in order to note them?</seg>
<seg id="53">Also still one, everyone should know what you make at every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to give to them to know something, that they must behave onlaijn just as, as they are doing this offlaijn.</seg>
<seg id="55">I/you/she governed same.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Out of internet the person is behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, one has to be in some social nets just as", she is asserting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Vigilance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Ehstuardo Guardiya, the university lecturer, the professor of the primary education and the consultant on education, a necessity of the politicians of the social nets conscientiously reading the heads of the families is explaining.</seg>
<seg id="59">Understanding each of the points, they have the good bases for talks with the children about the prerequisites of the opening for the discount entry in internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, he is saying "also that it is allowed what extending or what publishing age".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Concordant Gaurdiya, a key question is not to remind the children of a lesson "speak with the strangers".</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafaehlj Korrea, confirmed today that the creation of the common nationality is the goal in which there is "South America in this case," yes, he has to study by Europe".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Korrea who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (UNASUR) being organized in Lima declared the state television of Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" also in other clashes "however now they" practically "one native country".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It was defending, in this context, the project of the establishment of the South American nationality which countries participant UNASUR are approving.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve the free transfer of the citizens and the workers on just any South American country, it has already occurred with some members of Andskogo association as this, but up to now there are reactionary sectors which want to bring us back into a past" is warned it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Moreover, the Ecuadorian president showed himself as a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of the American states (OAS) under the prerequisite of the reduction of the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and the consideration of those who signed the Pact of San Jose about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who are giving lectures never undertake any obligations, but we, the South Americans are signing everything, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Inexplicable, that the inter-American human rights commission is in Washington and is being financed by the United States", he declared alluding to the political refuge given to the founder WikiLeaks Dzhulianu Assanzhu by Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Korrea certified that he is not regretting this decision because with it he did not commit his principles, and observed his "deep values" of democracy and human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that at that time "certain suspicions were in that that Assanzh be ehkstradirovan to the third country and the process will not be observed".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Moreover, it castigated Swedish justice to arrive to his territory for the interrogation behind demand about the crime on sexual ground being supposed, while "himself the Swedish legislation considers it possible to carry it by means of videokonferencii which one would be able to make out of the embassy of Ecuador in London out".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Korrea confirmed, that risk exists physical deterioration and mental health Assanzha.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I did not say anything serious with it ever since it arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem", said the Ecuadorian head of the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">So this is what is really the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health due to the confinement in the small space without opportunity to do the exercises in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">This influences just any person's health", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Korrea pointed out, what decision the problem of the refuge, granted Assanzhu since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the granting of the guarantee of inviolability which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs and emphasized that negotiations in London about the search of the solution to the problem of the confinement of the founder WikiLeaks were.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We are not carrying on the negotiations about human rights, we are not using this word for a present case, but constant discussions were.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs because lawyer Assanzha, Baljtasar Garson, is carrying out the series of the processes in different European instances" is mentioned it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And I/you/he expressed an opinion, what "will grant"if Great Britain tomorrow the guarantee of inviolability, this will end".</seg>
<seg id="20">AND if Sweden, as the legislation is excellently allowing it to her and as it has already made in other cases, Assanzha will interrogate a senor in the embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype will interrogate it, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Korrea took advantage of the situation, in order to show himself as advocate of the freedom of the press and I/you/he emphasized that "mediocrities, unscrupulousness and the lies which deform the freedom of the expression" are not patient.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The head enemies of the freedom of the press this not the spoiled malefactors politician, but the bad journalists that are keeping up a profit, a blackmail and a blackmail" he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It remained content that neither these journalists, "nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois countries leader have dominated" anymore "in Ecuador" in this aspect, and added, what, be re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution for the continuation of development in true direction".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Korrea also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least before the next elections, argu this with those, that the organization "has" to be hard it is not allowed to suffer opportunism and the support of the coups under the mask for legitimacy either", because in reality this shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In personal plan I have never been interested in an authority, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, the socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only on the side of political authority.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement considered that namely I guaranteed this probable victory so one has to admit this responsibility", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In the event of victory this would become my last period in the president's post, and then we are withdrawing from public life.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The mortality through Aids is the result of the late diagnostics today</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabricio was 21 year, when they announced to him that his analysis gave the positive result on an Aids.</seg>
<seg id="3">"They practically stunned me", he remembers that difficult, despite all the the doctor's measure, moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The youth hid this from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">After deciding to manage an illness independently, he wanted to hear about it as much as possible. Also his efforts proved correct - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabricio is one of the "oldest" patients of ВИЧ-department of the hospital of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where it wound up after overcoming quite a lot of obstacles in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It lives with a diagnosis "virus of the person's immunodeficiency" (AIDS) already 22 years. At the beginning of the nineties into this it would be complicatedly to believe - existed too little at that time the versions of treatment, they knew too little about an illness, in a too preconceived way they treated the patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social defense did not want to take his leave of it "because he had a cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those times having Aids was sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do this without making the quality of life worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless not knowing about their illness many people are coming up to now when the virus already caused the damage, "weakened" their immune system also they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 year after the appearance of the Aids in the peace later, at least after the first declared cases, "big achievement is at the present time that, what the survival of the patient, who begins a treatment timely, also the survival of the common population into precisions equal" , - ВИЧ department chapter indicated HCG, Xaijme Andrade Viljyanuehva after pleading that that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific edition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Also the ВИЧ/СПИДу, Andrade Viljyanuehva expert explained to Infekcionist that since 2008 the scientists came to the conclusion that the Aids is not sentence, however the duration and the quality of life depend on the degree of the defeat of the immune system which is available with the patients with the beginning of the diagnostics, with the better life-span being expected with those who are not using drugs: right up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4 are, also up to 50 years, when 500 CD4 are being announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply said, abovementioned means that that according to these terms who a diagnosis VICh-polozhiteljnogo has received at the age 25 years "will be able to live keeping up the control without problems right up to 75 years" he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to appreciate this progress, one should remember that the Mexicans' life-span has been today on average 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality came down in the last years, in the event of Mexico considerably, the number of the people, the dying men is from an Aids, came down from 6.678 in 2007 up to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report YuNEhIjDS), is also true and what from the moment of the appearance of Aids, 60 percent of the patients in national data base died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Xalisko of 255 people they died in 2011, and 187 deaths are already registered by May this year; nevertheless, it is being asserted that there is general access to the antiretrovirusnym compounds since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why are there up to now lethal issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - It personally seems to me that problem is not in access to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I imagine this, the situations are so in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The at the minimum last 12 years we have not had any shortage of the medicines, problem was that the patients are coming very late because they do not know about their infected state that is, at late stages of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It listed the crushing data: "Nine of ten patients are coming when they have already had some opportunistic infection; what it is necessary to make, so necessary in order to exert a greater influence upon a common mortality, this to see off diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to grant the tests for the discovery on mass scale, for all the people which" will "ask" for this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In their proposal specialists and the officials of the State counsel on prophylaxis SPIDa v Xalisko (COESIDA), as well as even the patients, kind of Fabricio which turned for the check to the private laboratory, incited agree only about that about opinion, what did this it the friend both, despite his young age, it already has been on the stages of Aids and suffered even with the sarcoma Kapowi, the cancerous tumor, which is one from some widespread complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is changing when you know what with you an Aids is.</seg>
<seg id="25">Several things think that they will die, and nothing wants not to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Since I anyway will die, I will better be torn off three times a week", they are saying. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I live well, I am doing exercises, I am taking medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Currently, his parents know that he bore the crawfish only.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live for normal life as any another does.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I am working, I have many lessons, I am traveling, I am carrying out active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I am taking care of themselves and of another person", is Fabricio transferred which agreed to share its private life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to spodvignutj those with its statement, who now, in the context of the Global day of the fight against Aids, a fear tests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Will let will be checked, if a risk of contamination was, let them hear whether they are VICh-polozhiteljnymi so better as soon as possible, and if they have already had a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as just any another person, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">This his message summarizes the topic of the fight against Aids in this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The chasms are great among the programs in the field of the health service and the simple citizen, thinks Rikardo Salazar, the journalist from Gvadalaxary who dealt with the problem connected to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="35">Also biggest this the prophylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, dedicated to this task, "as a matter of fact the spreading of the condoms increased, one or two gave to us earlier, now packages on a hundred give to us, and this is really good, but it is turning out that there are those who do not have the access to the condom now up to now", he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">There are teenagers among the most vulnerable to new infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why they are for you"? this is a popular question, with malice and condemnation, on the side of the social workers, the school consultants, the health service's co-workers of the drugstores and the workers, which teenagers do not want to hear a propagandist certified.</seg>
<seg id="39">I am offering to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms were not only behind the counters and that hundred their was in the automats in the places which often some young people visit in the public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not an encouragement of laxity.</seg>
<seg id="41">The talk is not about the payment of beer and the motel, answered the governor of Ehmilio Gonsales after they had asked him whether the dispensation of the condoms is possible on his instruction.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not sexuality, it is best to make the condoms accessible to those who have already practiced the sexual activity", he noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key data in Xalisko</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is registered 13.435 cumulative case (12,158 SPIDa and 1,317 VICh).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The staff is taking up the 4th place in national appraisement of new and cumulative cases of Aids and the 13th are up to AIDS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of contaminations belong to a sexual road, 6% across blood and 2% to a perinatal road.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">Gektor "Xetin" Reijes: "The basketball was my life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The inveterate basketball traveler Gektor "Xetin" Reijes has been connected to these sports for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, all the world went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Hardly anyone is keeping "Xetin" Reijes in Puerto Rico in the memory of so much basketballs histories, as Gektor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And, however, formerly than the brain hemorrhage confined it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reijes was dipped into sports into the flow of more than 60 years, as player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the commissioner and the leader BSN with the Cowboys Bayamona and president of the Federation of basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I fulfilled many roles in the basketball during its life, including somewhat simultaneously as when I was president BSN, the General Manager of the National Team and the president of the federation in the nineties," Reijes remembers in Bayamon during the visit of Primera Hora to his place home where it lives with Isabelj its true wife during the extent more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The basketball was my life".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reijes is not exaggerating doing this assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all the walls adorned by the photographs and the memory things, gathered for his long road, they are testifying to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamon in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the largest emotions it is keeping those, who remember his road through the Cowboys, starting with the middle of the fifties as player until 1982, after the talks into roles have been been old his 15 years from-agent or the agent of the contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This were my better years which I enjoyed most of all because I had the opportunity to be the part of eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, as agent from-agenta or the leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">Joys, including five championships which were going on from 1971 to 1975 a year have been many years.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I took my leave of one in 1981, in a year of the debut of Dzheroma Minsi v BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Kuko of Ortis which was a great administrator" started guiding since that moment and from now on: Reijes pointed out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that the Gin of Bartov which went here and was in the university of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: "I for you have a very strong player, the growth 6'7".</seg>
<seg id="16">You "want?"</seg>
<seg id="17">Also this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who were at Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartov recommended then sniper Raijmonda Gauss who received nationality and became one of our best high scorers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that I/you/he said what if Minsi brought championship Bayamonu, Gauss would have helped to conquer still one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">I enjoyed the Cowboys' championship with Gauss, but already in the distance, because I/you/he has already been registered as the boss of the federation by 1988.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements Minsi in national national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember how we beat the USA for the first time during the olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then a World Championship of 1990 on which we received the fourth place and this had to be bronze came if that Canadian judge who forced us to replay the final game did not say Reijes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">That team from the World Championship of 1990 is better national team, what you saw some day?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It among the better ones, in the same way as also that, which I/you/she won from Dream Team on the Olympic games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But that was my love, what from Panamerikanskix of games is in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we broke the national team of the USA which quite looked like that, which won bronze from us on the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that team not only they again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramona Rivasa, Lopesa Fiko and 'Pikulina' (Ortisa), but also 'Tonjito' Kolon young (Xavjer) and James Karter, the brothers Leon (Fransisko and Ehdgar) and Mario 'Kixote' Morales, who was not able to participate in 90 a year due to the trauma knees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Team, which was possibly, not the best one in the plan of the personnel, but I/you/she brought us a gold medal and a big joy, was the team of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neukene, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the roll players like 'Kanito' Njevesa, Pablo of Alisea and young Rolando Xurruitnera in place of the players, temporarily pushed aside is for a disorder in championship Panamerikanskom Mar-delj-Plata, we won gold contrary to all the forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without all doubts, this was Pikulin Ortis.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are impressing his indexes in the international tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one dominated in Puerto Rico so, as Pikulin did this, at this level.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also this is without account-taking of his career in the different leagues in which it was playing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican the leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very complicated question.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was with us very the good cubs generations that includes Xulio Toro, the Flora Melendesa, Karlosa of Moralesa, Raijmonda Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the young ones, I like the work as a Leo Arilly really.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you consider your main achievement in federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The participation by the national national team among 1988 and 1995 in the most famous epoch, and that there were up to 17 teams in a season at the beginning of the nineties in BSN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">That did you have to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Things were which I wanted, for example, to realize the regionalization of the smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that the boys played from Ponse only in their field and pleij-off is only against some teams from the other parts of the island in the national ones.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the children are traveling and are playing too much, also this is excessive.</seg>
<seg id="45">I see, at least, the fruits of obligatory certification and course for the operating, official persons and the judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">This brings me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I am listening to the music most of all, am watching the musical videos of my epoch in YouTube, am enjoying my grandchildren and go to some basketball matches from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I am enjoying the company of my wife, Icabelj which has always been with me.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week the students investigate the apokalipticheskie such as nuclear war, the zombie, the viruses and the bacteria phenomena and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In this semester, when the professor of the religion Styuart Warme decided to read course about an end of the world, he knew that the irresistible bait was available to I/you/he: the end of "the long reverse counting" of the calendar of Maya, on 21st December, which many people caught as behind proof that an end of the world approaches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Warme of idea did not have what expected it into the nearest a couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sehndi, the financial crisis which several things are calling "dolgoarmageddonom", and the growing conflict, where they will draw Israel, place, where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times think that Apocalypse will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not realize, that this will be of all the most samyij apokalipticheskiij semester", Warme told the students of the University Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey) this week.</seg>
<seg id="6">If to analyze that it is occurring in the peace at present how if with us 30 days in total remained, this was really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also remember, what bad good for those who have a apokalipticheskiij way of thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Also it is the professor not only who is offering courses for the topic of the "end of the world" in this semester, theoretical one last in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The associate professor Barri Vaker is reading course in the Templjskom university "Mass media, culture and end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week the students investigate the apokalipticheskie such as nuclear war, the zombie, the viruses and the bacteria topics, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We are analyzing why these ideas have been spreading with time", it, and a way said, who they are offering the hypothetical scenarios which cause the person's certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material falls into the terrorists' hands, for example, the war can burst out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month the students analyzed the films on apokalipticheskie topics and studied as they are being correlated with some examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell the students about it being possible, it being probable, it being plausible and it being impossible" Vaker said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The professor of history of Latin America Mehtjyu Restall and it co-worker Amara Solari, an associate professor of history of art and anthropology are in main kampuse of University of staff of Pennsylvania, amalgamated in order to read the course which is simply called "end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We are not adding '2012', in order to always have the opportunity to read course is once more in case the end of the world" will not "occur" said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite "the inevitable destruction", the students have to study, have to prepare projects and have to take final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">To Penn State the final examination will be taken on into the eve of Apocalypse, which is not leaving the students another choice, besides how we should work "until that night into which the end of the world will hypothetically occur" Restall said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses turned out to be quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"The places have been ending in two hours", Restall spoke about his course for the students with the high middle gain which 35 students enrolled in.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have been receiving the messages by e-mail for many weeks before the beginning of the semester from the people who asked whether there are places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students certify, for their part, that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I like to observe what the people are doing to comfort themselves", told Bridzhid Robinson, the 23-year-old student of the department of religion and sociology from Xaddonfilda, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the apokalipticheskiij form of the thought, the secular form or religious, this only a matter of solace or his absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Uill Vekesa, the 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and sisterly matter, said that I/you/he watched all the apokalipticheskie films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I have never heard about the course which would teach this", he noted.</seg>
<seg id="27">I like it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no one of the questioned students is have talked anymore about the professor: I/you/he did not say that he believes in the date of the end of the world on 21st December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project affected the prophecy of the Maya, and in some kind we discredited it", said Dzhuli Zeglen, the 21-year-old student of the last course is in the Templjskom university from Uehst-Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Maijya never predicted end of the world; this is simple the key moment in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that the apokalipticheskoe concern in western culture which has had a few centuries exists where the people react to some changes around predicting end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The internet caused the increase of these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other places the people do not think about this", he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Primarily in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dogerti, the professor of the religion of the university La-Salj who is teaching the courses in the Philippines in this year whether I/you/he answered a question about that fast, he about some course knows about "an end of the world" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines is not taking part at the end of the light", he wrote alluding in front of the higher instance to an order.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Dad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall turned attention, that during the long time was being talked about many days last the ships will not occur, I/you/he also said, what if nothing on 21st December, "the people will begin to think about the next date right away" or philosophize, that 21st December are the beginning of septennial period, according to course of which peace will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The students and the lecturers in a carefree way belong to this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several things said that they are preparing to go to the parties of "the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Perhaps, I "will call somebody of the friends in order to laugh together" Samira commented the Ford, the 20-year-old student of the faculty of connection.</seg>
