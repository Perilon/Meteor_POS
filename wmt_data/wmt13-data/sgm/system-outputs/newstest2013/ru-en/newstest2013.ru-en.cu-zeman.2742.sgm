<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders defended their policies to combat spin on the election.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in the center of Бреннана believe the myth, arguing that the cases of spin on the elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">The same lawyers Republicans have counted only 300 cases of electoral spin in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, such actions partly to discredit the system of american democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada american states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why most state governments since 2009, make laws, усложняющие registration process or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has gotten a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only for one year 2011 was taken by 180 legislation limiting the right to vote in the state's 41.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require pressing voter ID and proof of having фотографией with american citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws reducing the period of the early vote, voter registration упраздняют right in the voices of the day and undercut the right to vote for eligible citizens судимость.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections no US state not обязывал voters make ID with фотографией.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana-became the first staff, who gave such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court ruled in 2008 конституционность law, enacted in индиане.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican officials scurried to extend this practice and in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they have spurred bills, commit the voters make identity documents with фотографией, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, in contrast to the Quebec american citizens do not have such a universal identity documents, as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of american citizens, there are 21 million people, entered for the voting age, have no identity documents with фотографией, выданного government body of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 will not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the cost of obtaining required identity documents, often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions диспропорционально affect young people, minorities and people with low income levels.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000, 18% of people over the age of 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years, did not have the required identity documents with фотографией.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students-voters, who, as a vote for candidates from the Democrats, several states are not permitted to use the ID with фотографией, выданное their учебным заведением.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states allow members and рыболовецких охотничьих clubs who vote for Republicans, mainly used for the voting удостоверения, given to these клубами.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state has not demanded proof of the presence of american citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2001, more than a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are aimed at, obviously, to restrict voting by those who come from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is that two-thirds of latino voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters in day of voting in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also have the right to individuals or groups to help those who wish to зарегистрироваться.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction is not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make in lists of some 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, have led to a drop in the level of 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared to 2006 year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition to republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, who voted first, were афроамериканцами, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened with the domain of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted first.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to the white, which, while creating 76% of voters who voted, among the first was only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">A few projects laws was ветировано state governors — Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The action most неоднозначных laws was suspended with the intervention of the general prosecutor of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This enabled in part to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring formally identity documents with фотографией.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules, joined in the action, of course, will make it hard to generate suffrage in the election of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics of the Democrats' rail bias laws that have been taken, seeing in them an obvious target for it to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report from the center Бреннана 2011 reveals that the States, these laws are implemented, 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system, will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing clearly: these new regulations will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, such actions partly to discredit the system of american democracy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Скрининг cancer предстательной cancer: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the test on пса gives sometimes perverse results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to бесполезному medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men, and so reluctant проходящим диспансеризацию, there is what the засомневаться even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the research, conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups исследуемых, so it is difficult to interpret the findings, and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the european, found different levels of mortality in those patients who underwent скрининг, and those who do not pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of метастаз at 30-40% higher for those who have not passed скрининг.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, I recommended to be tested since, with 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had cancer простаты.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men of african-american descent is also subject to an increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is making the right decisions, as the only cancer detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient needs to clarify the extent of the risk of his ракового disease, offering him the possible options, without necessarily простаты cancer treatment, which poses no risk to life in the long term and making choices, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men who have surfaced, the cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressively and poses no threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We let them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress – we start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly we exactly define criteria for making decisions about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I recommended to still be tested.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also important проконсультироваться with their doctor to determine, or there is no need to pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of урологии Мовембер, has created a tool that enables us to assess all for and against the passage of test пса.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe, to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">That is, if all people nice питались and quite moving, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">“If no one was smoking, this figure has risen to at least 50 %,” highlights André Болье, press secretary of the canadian association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by наследственностью.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain the entirely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For canadian Association cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is doing huge damage to the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Even today in квебеке there are 1.5 million smokers,” says press secretary André Болье.</seg>
<seg id="33">Asia fact: in 10 years, after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is declining in half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the кар, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, Tolstoy and direct кишки, пищевода поджелудочной, cancer and матки.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer кишки Tolstoy,” adds in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it raises the risk of cancer sufferers from Tolstoy.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should also avoid колбасных products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Консервация meat by копчения, сушки or засола, can lead to education канцерогенных substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">“The past can harm the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer,” поясняют in Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Витамины</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have been exploring the influence of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called однозначными.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the SCC, vitamin E studies give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed the reduction in the risk of developing cancer простаты, another gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer, vitamin D and there is no complete clarity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Бозон Хиггса in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Минувшим summer reported that scientists may have found бозон Хиггса, caused the fuss – and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is that this бозон explains all the mass of particles in the universe, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, this latest particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model, our best, or, in any case, “the least imperfect” descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, but which has not managed to find empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics is still not certain that it is precisely about бозоне Хиггса.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we have to deal with, really new частицей and that it strongly resembles бозон Хиггса predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, is to confirm, though for the full confidence of some of the data is not yet достает.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Хиггса, as the chances of astray seem minimal, and consider what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world, one law is inevitable, гласящий, two things that may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no way around that rule, does not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of this nature: the principle of the Pauli exclusion, which постулирует that two particles cannot occupy the same space at one and the same time, if they are in the same “квантовом state” is a “state” is, in broad outline, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of this, the share of physics particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find a decent citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the other, the суетятся бозоны гнусная Banda, the anarchists, who have no respect for nothing — at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно prove to be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Both reports site (incidentally, totally необыкновенный) Particle Adventure Berkeley lab, these бозоны was, in turn, on two groups: мезоны, about which we are not here to speak, and “force” particles, which are subject to the forces of nature and that in some way applies бозон Хиггса.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you have been able to read the хронику, this one thanks to the incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or “частице light”, which is “курьером электромагнитной forces.”</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle, with electrical заряд, accelerating or changing direction, this “violates” электромагнитное field in this particular place, roughly as the stone for the fishpond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this “violations” is born электромагнитная wave (of light, or инфракрасного radiation or ультрафиолета, etc.), and this surge is no more than a фотоном - and, therefore, one of the “host бозонов forces.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same thing is happening with бозоном Хиггса, with only the gaps that to this бозон emerged, must be “broken” another field, field Хиггса.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the field Хиггса much, much стабильнее электромагнитного field; to stir up his need to achieve and very, very high энергий, as if it came to замерзшем пруде, the surface which could offend only very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why a huge ускоритель particles, as one who are exploiting the ЦЕРНе - G Адронный Коллайдер, a ring with диаметром in 27 kilometers! - to achieve such huge энергий.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field, useful, and also to explain the relationship between бозоном Хиггса and host.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic fields.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like for example магниты, interact, while others-no: leaf paper, for example, will not be kept in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles interact with the field Хиггса: those who interact with supply, while others (like фотон, incidentally) it does not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what is the “can do” all of these studies, asked Miss Пламондон?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science, they are used to test the right standard model (see), and it also allows physicists нащупать divergence between the results of observations and expectations of projectiles.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, some of them object to yearn for such divergence of comprehension, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for “new physics” and silence some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, we need to say, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for the gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which shapes the roughly 80% of the universe (oops-oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But as far as ЦЕРНе such disparities are not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person's difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: in the early 1960's pioneers research laboratories in лазера белла could not even think, and what kind of revolution will bring to their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in Лабораториях белла, where, in 1960, was invented лазер, and who himself has developed the first continuous лазер (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially лазер was seen more as a “лабораторный гаджет.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine …</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And, moreover, can an annex is for the toolkit, сопровождающего study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optic research in 1969, has developed a small датчик light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This датчик, although this was not at all of its original definition, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This, of course, does not mean that the work of great Адронного Коллайдера will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.</seg>

<seg id="3">The debate should resume shortly, and in this time is preparing a bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet in this crucial area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Debt” tried to take a closer look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Монтережи.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cancer простаты, разрушавший his uniqueness, gave him a reprieve for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">“I was given five years, I had lived seven,” he says, between life and death, лежа in bed in the orphanage паллиативного nursing Victor - Гадбуа in Белёй, which arrived on the eve of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is doing their job: unbelievable weakness, which does not give themselves walk in the toilet and even their own feed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at the table, on which it is worth аппетитный lunch, he agrees, and seem to have helped him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He бодрится, even manages to smile, to talk with незнакомыми people who work around him, bring him drugs, are in his ванну.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage in normal death.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I have the greatest desire to me вылечили from diarrhea, it is humiliating,” he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the staff has found the drug from this malaise.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">“During his life teaches us that a man should мочиться standing,” Pierre tells Broder, a psychologist in the orphanage-Viktor Гадбуа.</seg>
<seg id="17">Регрессировать to state child-for some unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“Everything depends on the ability to cope with the decline of the man”, he argues.</seg>
<seg id="19">So how, in the view of many people, although паллиативным departure, in the most important events случаяются and the height of this decline.</seg>

<seg id="20">Patients coming in паллиативный asylum-Viktor Гадбуа, all sick cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts look to for them at the three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called “therapy”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Miss A., 89 years, most fears die “in the consciousness that is being strangled.”</seg>
<seg id="24">But instead, the disease has allowed me to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">“I have good children,” she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">“I don't want nothing more in life,” she says, before being allowed to put it, маску облегчающую breath.</seg>
<seg id="27">It still awaits in the coming days, the recent visit of his son, приехавшего from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the orphanage, Viktor Гадбуа - with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is паллиативный departure, which remains, when nothing more can be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the death of more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In квебеке for every 11 700 residents account for one seat in institutions паллиативной aid.</seg>
<seg id="32">This very little, given that, sooner or later, we are all dead.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctor's home.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to паллиативному caring</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Is that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному caring, that is, to the withdrawal, which is given to alleviate the suffering of patients, Secretaries in the stage of their life, whether in the home, in the hospital or in the orphanage.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as asylum-Viktor Гадбуа and society паллиативного nursing home large Монреаля, are pursuing more or less exclusively on care for cancerous sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is a big gap in the health care system of Quebec leads many doctors specialists паллиативному caring for fear of the law, легализирующего assistance and aid in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October циркулирует manifesto signed by beacons in паллиативного withdrawal, Dr Балфуром Маунтом and Dr Бернаром Ляпуантом and свидетельствующий about their disagreement with this initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christian мартель, Quebec's health-care system is not enough, in order to secure the right to паллиативный departure of high quality to be resolved, the transition to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, “I saw пациентку, which has spent 14 days in the separation of emergency, in harrowing болях, and no one has taken the necessary measures to make it easier for them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die, only because they did not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="1">“ПСЖ - not фк Barcelona!”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season you have achieved in ПСЖ необыкновенного scope.</seg>
<seg id="3">As you объясните this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by the individual сознательностью, but can-and the new измерением ПСЖ.</seg>
<seg id="5">Profit great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I расту every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technical staff also much place.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything is happening very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I'm not распаляюсь.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the beginning, in the middle of the preliminary work in НИФ in Клерфонтене and before my arrival in Saint - Этьен I always шагал forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you извлекаете benefit from competition, established by Carlo Анчелотти …</seg>
<seg id="14">Пополнению this summer, not the play matches very high levels.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to such a player, as I want to be on the level and выкладываться at maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Carlo Анчелотти lends support to my позиционировании.</seg>
<seg id="18">His deputy, help such as Claude Макелеле, who played in the same position, and I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Анчелотти - boss position?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Анчелотти inspires respect to the technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, in the league, he has no equal in number, and he is the best coach in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experience, and he won with plenty of титулов высококлассными клубами.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles парижу.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I отходил from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has, I also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season ПСЖ?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league лион took place in our leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the League champions: we said квалифицировались восьмую one in the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We'll try to get as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say to his word face-to-face with a very good european teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">First, we want to finish first in our group, in Porto, in order to be able to accept a return match in one-eighth the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether ПСЖ become first-class european club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">It has to have the budget …</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major european club, парижу needs to win titles and cement position on a long-term view.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, the ПСЖ has the means to make the project viable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Do not take the title in the league last season, will be the biggest failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we actual ardently desire to get this чемпионский title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were close to it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, was a disappointment, because we had all come to manage the first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We completed it with 79 очками.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Монпелье, played more фантастический season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think, all will be in order.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that, in a fight for the title are such strong teams, as Marseille, лион Bardot and, I think, that we have the power to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you not think that the media expected too much from ПСЖ?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect much, given how much was FDI and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully prepared for this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against Труа and we still find that раскритиковать, of course, it is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We ask, what the people expect more from us.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with accounts of 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not фк Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to promote the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proven in the league champions that can respond to modern challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester Юнайтед, which already has two season, failing to qualify for the final one восьмую, although they, too, have spent huge amounts of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given that we put the amount you were 15 points ahead of already to зимнему перерыву.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be to neglect our opponents and the French.</seg>
<seg id="67">Лион and Marseille, which did not rise to the occasion in the past season, were “awakened” this new ПСЖ.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how увлекательна first League.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, and as a result we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">ПСЖ seems to depend entirely on deeds Златана Ибрагимовича.</seg>
<seg id="71">So what if, say, that there is some “Златанозависимость.”</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that ибрагимович very successful and that he beat a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to this and it shows that he is a star of the League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and star of world-wide.</seg>
<seg id="75">As a group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surround him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done, it really is.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates and others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Тьяго Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have the Euro-2012 with a team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I fervently wish to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me grab a little playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there, many things, and I was there.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I was able to play a good отборочные matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I hoped for since my крещения in blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave образцово.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first месяцах Дидье Дешама led blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They результативны for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">It has a good position in отборочной group the world.</seg>
<seg id="91">He's strict coach, he is close with the players, and encourages the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Блан.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Блан reached its goal, he квалифицировал us into the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Дидье Дешам lead blue in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Good заслуженная draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is the key match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given us the confidence in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such games.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, изобретенный Сатоши Накамото (nom de guerre), while at the same time is a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros …) and secure exchange of Protocol on the type of BitTorrent, which allows members to exchange файлами between one level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200,000 operations have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites make биткойны for donations or as a tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The биткойна, reaching a peak at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, fell to $2, before the return today to roughly ten dollars (rates identifies the site bitcoincharts. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing extraordinary in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report of a virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes the биткойн as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “a similar to the common currency”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Биткоин is different from other types of virtual currencies, as a “credit” used to advance in видеоигре, which are made in the process of the game or who may buy (and sometimes and convert).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operations of exchange controls and always обрабатывает any central authority.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all Биткойн узлы networks are simultaneously the holders of the accounting books, аудиторами, currency issuers, покупателыми and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">This network operates?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each deal between two users actually happening between the two electronic адресами, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only for each new payment users can choose the other allegations, thereby ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The set of information, concerned by the deal, struck электронно, using a system of шифрования with double the key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can also verify the authenticity deals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to содержимому файла may test that биткойны, used in the bargain, there really are in public счетной book разосланной throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A key step is to register a new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">She is going through a solution of mathematical equations, разосланной решивший computers, which, as a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new строку.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is about phase хэширования файла, converting large файла in digital signature, a brief and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers “borrow” new транзакцию and add it to the number, before the “хэшировать” all together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number, which would give a unique digital signature (many нулей in early).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as it is found, the number of other узлы easily verify that it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Транзакция thus proving нерарзрывно цепочкой associated with all other transactions; any modification of change digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, with the aim of deception users very quickly (less than ten minutes) willing to pay twice the improvement and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be vindicated by the network — and the other would remain неподтвержденной, as they have different electronic подписи.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, решивший task, receives 50 биткойнов.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the reward regularly share пополам, probably until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited to 21 million, but they делимы стомиллионной to one that still leaves the Fed …</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already experienced the ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sites, services Bitcoin, have been attacked, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Used by the defect is not for the protocol,” Pierre заверяет Нуаза, which recently launched Paymium-company осуществляющую payments real money using a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also told about the possibility of laundering money through this this анонимную service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash will also enjoy this flaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept the donation of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, their permit.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Ади Shamir and Дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed счетную book and found that almost 80% of биткойнов does not come in.</seg>
<seg id="41">“The massive sell-off” were announced in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">“Thirty thousand dollars were swapped” радуется Йон Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which deals with конвертацией биткойнов in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Нуаза, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or бесконтактного payment via mobile phone, but it uses to test the Bitcoin transactions, thus goes cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="45">Обладатель better control of their personal data, and can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to set new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just enough to tell us that can be “сфотографировать and recognizable” телефоном specifies, Pierre Нуаза worry that he has already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of more горизонтальных.</seg>
<seg id="49">“Before the Bitcoin утвердится, it will be for some time, but the year 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult births of Egypt's constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him an extraordinary powers, he decided to play by the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="4">Застав everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago, the head of the state provided a collection of two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon for two years, as Egypt relies on preliminary text, in which several times been amended, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the view of his opponents, the president persists in its “autocratic бреду”, “continuing to violate the word” and “flout right.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are convinced that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held for 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to refuse to explain the intentions of the text of the article for egyptians, Article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent is raging across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he declared in one interview american еженедельнику Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The more that the call to fast-track vote like an ultimatum to the egyptian people: “either you голосуете for my text, or I оставляю itself extraordinary powers”, which, as expected, should be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals not откликнулось on challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society, have done the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the necessary кворум was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the brothers-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that in most cases, the articles were проголосованы unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Комментаторов позабавил, incidentally, is the fact that one of the few differences emerged days around … time to pray, because some members of the committee thought that clock Constituent Assembly were wrong to set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday still go vote, is composed of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of attention, Article 2 ultimately remained identical to an article of the constitution of 1971, гласящей, that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.</seg>
<seg id="25">Салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the “principles” on the “rules” that would give them the opportunity to more rigorous application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, who see in this a public relations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their view, the Islamization constitution happening through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to Article 220, which grants the University of al-Azhar консультативную role, in particular, in terms of verifying compliance with laws шариату.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to specialist on Egypt софи Помье, this is worrying, because “the people that are supposed to make the decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the emergence of theocracy.”</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, moreover, взбудоражены fact that the next president of this university, it seems, will be far less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">“At the moment there is no particular religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on these texts are not ulamas, and people with a university education, some trained by the french system” - reassures Блое Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that “around Article 220-digit can emerge, as used in terms of religious заимствованы лексики.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to the “фикх” [Islamic law, прим ред.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And, in the future, could emerge, the question of how civilian judges competent to pass judgment on this.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Aside from its religious aspects, the text passed yesterday, is subject to criticism, because it gives the sweeping powers of the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they have significantly reduced compared with those which have been under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another moot point: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget is not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also not be blocked by the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the association to protect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The past also expressed concerns about the text, which they believe in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Saved the responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth forbidden to insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of expression, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, none of the articles are no longer talks about protecting women, highlights Хеба Мораеф, from Хьюман Райтс Вотч.</seg>
<seg id="47">In her words, the only positive moment marks the prohibition of torture in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word, which had arisen in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the egyptian president was supposed to speak yesterday evening on television, манифестации scheduled today in the second half of the day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">As long as the MPS and lawyers argue that the law would give about обязательном linguistic testing, in a country already appeared rogues, selling “липовыми сертификатами”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Each year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities, Russia's coming 13 million guest workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority of the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only aim is to earn money to support the families of the remaining at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">From 1 December entry into force of the law, according to which each worker мигрант owes will lose the exam on knowledge of the russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">As long as this usually works only for those who intend to work in the service sector, жилищно - communal beings, agriculture and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over time, however, the promise in ФМС, tests will become compulsory for all coming.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will have to lose not only the language, but Russia's history, and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of language will have to affirm and to gain, and to extend permission to work.</seg>
<seg id="11">An exception is only for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the language of the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not elude law and people get успевшие аттестаты and degrees of education until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, обреченность and protection of human rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network экзаменационных points will work under the auspices of the Institute of russian language name Pushkin, the University of Friendship, мгу СПбГУ, and other russian college.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants will cede tests in all cities; now in Russia for more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative of the tests supported and MPS, and госдумы ФМС.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here are the lawyers, before the law came into force, too many times in the press to ask the question: what, exactly, will it?</seg>
<seg id="18">That will change that knowledge of language and for Russians, and for themselves a visitor?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, the reply of migration services, this will reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery.”</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of talk now about protecting the rights of labor migrants, поясняет ФМС Russia's chief representative in Tajikistan, Viktor Себелев.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights must start before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The system will allow only organized set of 90% of the foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems are the migrants without the profession, education, not knowing the language, not a medical освидетельствования.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without an understanding of the language, is confident Себелев, future мигрант is bound to face недобросовестными people who, under the guise of helping him “всунут путёвку” in жуткий тесный Barack, where he and dozens of his kind will be months томиться without food and documents, вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">“At home they promise one thing and to приезду bilking them, imposes passports, do not pay the promised wages,” confirms chief chief of labor migration мс Tajikistan Толиб шарипов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not ругайся, насяльника!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, while many citizens среднеазиатских republics, gathered on the commercial opportunities in Russia, is that not only does not know the language of the country, in which aspire to, but on its own it is hard to write.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their wines, but the problem: few malleable, Uzbeks, Tajiks, can afford to get even толковое primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families even to feed their children, let alone to decently, and their одевать обувать снаряжать in school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Дорастая before подросткового age, these guys at the first opportunity sent on earnings.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if not with a knowledge of the language, they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Чувствуешь and incomplete.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">True, in the law's language lawyers point out one important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the same status-there will be no экзамена, nor the subsequent official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, much of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“You are welcome, or outsiders log воспрещен”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the Visiting argue that to get official status in our country is not so simple.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is in the bureaucratic препонах and all those same linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, legalization is worth the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And that is the fake registration can be done quickly and in just one-and-a - half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, hence there is no registration, and cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,” reflected with journalists citizen Tajikistan Умед Хушкадамов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“Налетай, not скупись, Buy painting”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of membership in the force of law about language, фальшивыми are not only мигрантские documents about the registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">A few “липовых” to buy certificates of Test linguistic tests already изъяты ФМС employees.</seg>
<seg id="48">Spurious отпечатаны paper on the usual цветном принтере.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they could be holding the new owners not задаром: each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus ease the task of passing the tests, it has paid for the document's seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">In this two-plus times more expensive procedures of the formal tests: it would cost labor мигранту in three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">That is the task of the soon-to protect the system from corruption, to “корочки” cannot be simply buy converge, and representatives of the authorities, and lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the meantime, the authorities can promise гастарбайтерам, not сумевшим successfully undergo testing times, with the first time to study the basic языкового rate.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, приезжим, not russian, who will be предлагаться work in areas not suggest active communication with the people.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Russia's interior ministry proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of the civilian weapons.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: нажать silent on свадьбах when, without the victims, and slaughter, Moscow's lawyer Dmitry виноградовым, as a result of which нажать killed seven people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Police want to ban the wearing of травматики in public places and raise the age from which one can get a license to weapons-from 18 years to 21 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of the proposed, head of the Duma committee on security and counter corruption ирина яровая and promised that the amendments in the law about weapons do in Госдуму soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not everyone is happy that the russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “закручивания screws.”</seg>
<seg id="8">In a letter, which the authors-representatives of various public стрелковых organizations-require to abandon the “senseless tightening.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of registered weapons хулиганства with minimal, said the russian service, the BBC's lawyer - криминалист Vasily forest rangers charged with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the interior ministry, the six months of the 2012 $committed crimes with gunshot, recorded in the interior, while all over the same period recorded 1168 thousands of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of an open letter, confident that the tightening of legislation in the area of civil weapons not put offenders go on a “black market”.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, they say, in Moscow can find any weapons to not really high price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, in the interior ministry argue that control the situation with the spread of illicit weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from factories to officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The “black market” weapons пополняется through a variety of channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main such channels five, tells a colonel in the resignation of Viktor баранец, ten years проработавший structure in the Department of Education and генштабе.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Скриншот site that takes orders for weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first is “the army or military footprint”, that is, the weapons, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Weapons тащили and russian officers, and кавказцы themselves,” says баранец.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This kind of “black” - weapons stolen criminals from representatives of the power structures.</seg>
<seg id="21">Баранец поясняет that this includes and унесенные with police складов, and stolen directly from the staff of law-enforcement agencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal “стволы” has its roots in the sale with military складов.</seg>
<seg id="23">For many military pick often have exploded.</seg>
<seg id="24">“There is a version of the proven that part of s-were made specifically to укрыть недостачу”, says the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">For its part, according to баранца, hidden weapons manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“Now плодятся private arms factory, which not only 12.2 on the international market and emits weapons from flooring on the black market, including Moscow,” tells the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of “black-market smuggling.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially many пистолетов автоматов and come from poor countries, for example, Киргизии.</seg>
<seg id="29">“There is its production, sometimes кустарное, and a mafia, which sent a stream,” поясняет former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts thought, roughly what share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.”</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this in 2011, drew up the center of the troubled analysis and public-managerial design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analyzed the MVD, accountability and Росстата криминологическую literature and open data порталов gun on topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">By far the largest part of the illicit weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and power networks.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market was there “to officials, whose work is linked with weapons,” said the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of the cases, the weapons come from the seats of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur хищения on stage production of weapons, 5% in the “black археологию.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The seller is a consultant to one of weapons stores, попросивший not call it the name, pledging that weapons, найденное black копателями, long ago nobody buys is too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often than not, as he says, for a new party sellers go on military storehouse.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through прапорщика man buys unit, for example a pistol тт.</seg>
<seg id="40">He give her, transmit through заборчик.</seg>
<seg id="41">“He flies in the city and sells here for 900 euros for штуку with two shops,” he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">“The truth is that the police in the course of all, so periodically when burning plan for раскрываемости crimes, a procurement controls the traffickers illegal weapons,” adds consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">“As in a store.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer most often find each other through the unknown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I заглядывал on sites, in blogs, does not yet have comrade, who offered to come on a platform of “беговая”, where will people who увезет me in the corner of”, where we will bargain.</seg>
<seg id="46">Price ствола I learned only there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The military observer Viktor баранец</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To get ствол me a familiar, in which there is a way out, tells a seller-consultant. — I have an acquaintance there, but I do not believe in it.</seg>
<seg id="49">Sellers in the markets is, but there also needs to be replaced, relatively, “from Ivan ивановича, who asked to have a tooth дочки had.”</seg>
<seg id="50">I now even a couple of кастетов достаю through human, in which certain.</seg>
<seg id="51">He, too, is supplying them only to me, because it knows that I not сдам.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">New entrants are seeking weapons differs.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military Viktor баранец already itself in the role of the buyer, illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when groomed for the publication of an article about this.</seg>
<seg id="54">Schemes, he says, has not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He gave альбом with фотографиям, where “was all that happened.”</seg>
<seg id="56">“I feel like in a store,” recalls the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Bidder, according to баранца, do not offer cat in мешке - all we can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, a potential client, not simply buying-we едем with the seller in the forest, there are posing a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">“Give me an opportunity to shoot, and when I убеждаюсь that weapons hitting well, are starting to bargain,” describes the procedure expert.</seg>

<seg id="60">Shop on диване</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Поисковики Internet address on websites and groups in “Вконтакте”, where the offer to buy weapons “for different purposes.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">This does not need no documents and personal meetings.</seg>
<seg id="63">“Enough to have a certain amount of money,” written in advertising on the site of the “Fighting шапке bought a pistol or a machine gun.”</seg>
<seg id="64">The users leave their application and asking questions.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the US, the бастуют фастфуда workers and supermarket</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through work on “кассе макдоналдс” by up to a quarter of all american teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in универмагах corporations Walmart and fast-food restaurants popular networks, such as “макдоналдс”, “Бургер King”, “Тако Bell,” “Уэндис” and “Kentucky фрайд чикен.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As long as no one takes predict, into whether this surge in the ninth вал or it is to expire in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Stocks support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file employees of Walmart, and a system of fast food, suggested the protests is the creation of their trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">As long as this sector is not gripped by trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Stocks began last week, the day after благодарения, in the so-called “black Friday”, when America crashed orgy of cheap распродаж захватившая, millions of “Street and sometimes сопровождавшаяся потасовками.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To this day, some workers corporations Walmart, in which around the world hard 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and пикетировали together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporations, whose product расчитан on modest and middle-income people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all the light, from пеленок, охотничьих ружей and car thermal energy to пылесосов, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">So many-paid employees of Walmart отовариваются only on paper.</seg>
<seg id="14">Availability and range of goods made Walmart, one of America's largest corporations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap goods, in part because little is paying their workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The past also complain about working conditions, for example, on the lack of автопогрузчиков or live hand сканеров.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants in the “black Friday” required to raise wages and grumbled about the cost of health insurance, to borrow the corporation, spiking from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">Типичному worker Walmart, получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, this costs unaffordable, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart will boost среднуюю salary to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost the corporation to 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is roughly 1.1% more than it spends on pay now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of buyers, each visit to the shop will do them all to 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For a year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart fairly note that protests have occurred only in nine states and corporations have no малейщего damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Black Friday” to continue in its stores from 8 p. m. on Thursday, before midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its кассовые boats produced in “black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the corporations Deng Фогелман argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the action of protest has been all - навсего “another пиаровским трюком” организовавшего its trade union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“Free касса!”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued into this week in New York, where their target were not универмаги Walmart (in this progressive city not жалуют, and so their here as long as there is no), and “макдоналдсы” and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Макдоналдс says that it sells billions порций, and after that he does not even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Джумейн Williams, a member of the New York City горсовета</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At this moment, the minimum salary, according to the federal and New York law is 7,25 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast-food restaurants, over time, its pricing, but only, and on average they rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Fewer of them in this expensive city does not make one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can you be in New York on such money, for me, is inconceivable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through “макдоналдсы” was nearly a quarter of american teenagers who подрабатывали for their прилавками after school, living with the parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few who saw in the main source of table or planned задержаться there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, I am constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers “Макдоналдсов”, who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even to feed her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Forum newspaper Wall Street Journal hangs comment, which the author observes that irresponsible kids, if you don't know what you will have to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The protests, which began at 6.30 in the morning Thursday, the “Макдоналдса” 40-68 on the street and Madison-avenue, demanded that кассирам поварам system and fast food began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, that is more than the current minimum have doubled their salaries.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the fast food were created labor organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration has rarely made it easier for them to life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But now, the trade union rapid nutrition is difficult and for subjective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main-extraordinary churn ordinances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Несогласные</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The tumultuous protests took place in this day and a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The climax was the stock in mid-day rally in “Макдоналдса” near Times Square, which is opposed by several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the горсовета Джумейн Williams, stated: “макдоналдс” says that it sells billions порций, and after that he does not even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by other prominent and the New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city, Bill de Бласио, stated that, “we must дружно join in support of workers fast food that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York йоркец!”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As охарактеризовала what the New York Times, this was the biggest event of this kind in the history of american fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid общепита, which in New York with tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">So far, it is not clear whether this would generate искра flame mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">“As long as it is a medium to fool the brain”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technology topic дополненной reality in the recently adopted seen mostly through the prism of special eyeglasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At first, the summer on its annual conference operating model has shown Google, and then in November it was known that bid for the corresponding patent applied and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, from a conversation with a group of online 3D-technology in Кэмбриджской lab Microsoft Шарамом Изади follows that for scientists this company score - пройденный phase.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air, bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Расскажите, please, in broad outline, what does your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Are we doing human interaction with cars, but with this attempt to раздвинуть borders this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">As long as mankind in part застряло on stage work with пикселями on flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We just want to look at the 5-10 years ahead and foresee the drastic change in this engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, приставка сенсоры Xbox and Kinect is a step forward, and almost no one now Xbox Kinect is not for sale, after all, without all the interesting жестовое management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Is that still awaits us ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that Kinect have endured the interaction on a physical level, much still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The improved system gets more information (data), and the conclusion is not very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that, working on a truly трехмерными отображения systems on the basis of the various technologies, including проективных.</seg>
<seg id="15">To be released in the computer world, our physical, make it more physical.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place-to hell these дурацкие шлемы virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">What do you think about голосового management?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular штука, but not переоценивают is it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It certainly is not a panacea, the question arises приватности, because not always wants извещать surrounding about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all kinds of interacting with computers are good, but everyone in their нише.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the management of устройствами in public places there was a project in which we thought of gestures, but not over размашистыми, and over such parsimonious, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">With gestures filmed not cameras device, and наручным браслетом that фиксировал for movement and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="25">As long as he is a big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of наручных hours.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general, the future for mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Is it both?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">— For example, how can you ask me to pass on to you the bank газировки?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say and simultaneously покажете.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">“I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- About, it will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">There is something you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not, for the moment, the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Is not necessarily, but this mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think, in the short time we mostly have to work on the development of new types of сенсоров, which will allow more accurately determine people's reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, лазерные сенсоры, they provide a good resolution on the surface, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">If the talk about your work with сенсорами Xbox Kinect, which you claim to modern камерам?</seg>
<seg id="37">Lacks the depth of the resolution, or even something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In principle, the current generation is what you can build in our work over трехмерным распознаванием.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the well would get мегапикселей 8 speed to / with.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not in themselves мегапикселях, and as матрицы and depths.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the last point of view, all current technologies for us is not enough good-it adds to the work проектировщикам algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then there is need to remember not only the pro-settlement осям X and Y and Z's house.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also very important that the speed of the number of employees in the second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The man is a dynamic, and the current 30 to / with frankly маловато, especially for the gesture.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Бетишес from our Рэдмондской lab made сенсор касания with regulated delayed processing-from 1 to 100, with modern мс серийные сенсоры closer to the second (60-100) figures.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would in my work very пригодился equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний to employees in the second was more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">– And the number of cameras increase does not need to be?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">In Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which actually - инфракрасный излучатель, and the second sink for reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And this is already the third camera-that is, indeed, the usual сенсор visible spectrum.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not applied to determine the depth of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem …</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible counterpart, with Kinect поиграться кривизной location of cameras and look, as this will help in determining трехмерном position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">— Remember how, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not презентовала public their points.</seg>
<seg id="56">You are not, it seems that from the point of view of routine use of technology дополненной reality points – this is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Of course, the all-time разгуливать, tossed смартфон in raised hands, not very comfortable, but this is what I think: the steep option would be “переходящая” дополненная reality when, on the basis of a cloudy platforms you would increasingly turn to points on смартфон, проекционный дисплей and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points are very personal device, in that their power (приватные things you see only), and at the same time weakness - дополненная reality on the basis of points would not allow you to work on virtual objects, together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual голографическими objects in the air, available not only Tony старку from “Iron man”, but simple and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, critics often point to the idea: there is no тактильного recall!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lecture, I often say that дополненная reality is the seventh-a breakthrough in the compact human and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that may well be the eighth добавка тактильных fever.</seg>

<seg id="7">Кирилл миллер - one of the very петербургских socio-philosophical сказочников, creators of new мифологий.</seg>
<seg id="8">Кирилл миллер is a man петербургского avant garde of the late 1980's-of the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, he is a man of cities, its emergence on the streets is causing his smile from citizens, поднимающий all mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">He recently took in the hands of шарманку and became петербургским шарманщиком, as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.</seg>

<seg id="11"> - Кирилл, and why do you still ходишь city on the red, and not in the Yellow or бирюзовом, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> “I chose the red color as модельер, in appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red color is a compromise between художником имиджмейкером, and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although in a society that is perhaps not серое, aggression and excitement недоброго properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations designed to began speaking.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my stock is an invitation to a provocative debate.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At an exhibition in DC невском, where were выставлены my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that this is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and the new, free like me were uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became дружить with a new wave of artists, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the “пушкинской - 10”, and more of it.</seg>
<seg id="22">I quit in theater, the clothes, the music, all жанры, beyond words.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="23"> And all of this is united in your Арт - clinic … - I was important очутиться in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where should gather all the best of the creative forces.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took on the territory of пушкинской - 10, and as long as there was no repairs, existed музыкально - артистический club, богемный Club, home of the St. Petersburg богемы.</seg>

<seg id="65">Report: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of the consumption, this from the other operas.</seg>
<seg id="67">I'm a man of culture of yesterday's day, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and die in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of рисования pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I have for this is culture.</seg>

<seg id="74">This is in Moscow is now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have the leverage, there are people who could be experts, but they задвинуты, as need higher experts who correctly assess these experts and offer them the way.</seg>

<seg id="81">We need a cultural soils, and we have now more writers than readers, that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">Here in Europe, the very many people любопытствующих. either on the exhibition, concerts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">I think that choice is low.</seg>

<seg id="11">Approach to matters of reproduction in space began with flora.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get out completely normal птенца.</seg>
<seg id="17">But a further problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The problem with the fact that this птенец should find a toehold, it must rely on its ножки and start moving,” поясняет заведующий laboratory Institute health biological problems (ИМБП) injuries, Vladimir сычев.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding a toehold, птенцы randomly кувыркались.</seg>
<seg id="20">And in 10 hours, the newborn was full атрофия instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Птенцы not to react to light and breath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there was the point that, through four суток they simply погибали.</seg>
<seg id="23">“And the two times we вылупляли птенцов, after it refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them,” - the failure of an experiment with Vladimir сычев птенцами in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time with animals biological “миниковчег” flying in orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on “биоспутнике Бион” will be the only gay species.</seg>

<seg id="28">In principle, there is not a supernatural found nothing.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing from space rats have offspring.</seg>

<seg id="32">Not an easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, losing, customary habitats, simply could not realize their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">The same people, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.</seg>

<seg id="36">On ethical grounds such experiments.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women in space would fly for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was the Tereshkova's.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious, that have the humanity, is a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our чайка улетела, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the fly in space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether it is the child after the birth of the air.</seg>
<seg id="42">“After all, on this issue, no one is in charge,” says veteran ракетно - space industry вахтанг Вачнадзе.</seg>

<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman: светланы савицкой, twice побывавшей on orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, a son was born.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">We have a few units, there are astronauts, after long flights all cost, and growing healthy generation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The military chief of the main checkpoints ревизионного management: checking шварц - system failed due to the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the industry, the Czech Republic has a good government procurement agencies control and, despite the availability of quality legislation, has lagged in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav кала, vice-president of the Supreme checkpoints ревизионного management, from an interview for the site Aktuálně. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“The law will never be perfect, but he must correctly applied, which, in my opinion, we are lacking,” commented the present кала.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusions provides joint inspection czech and german regulators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the wrong approach Peter Нечаса practices lead to so-called шварц - system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister announced that гдп (Civic Democratic Party) will not be concerned about entrepreneurs audits-goes it is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">“The law should be somehow appropriate, and if it is something bans, and the Prime Minister may not stand up to the workings of the institutions, which are expected to remain the responsibility of audit and seek to meet their obligations,” an кала.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting, ревизионного committee in the Chamber of Deputies you разговаривали about a joint project between the Czech and the german parties, within the framework of which was сопоставлено legislation for public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Had in mind the parallel review that we began, perhaps, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it suggests that european legislation says, how should undergo public procurement, it follows the national legislation and then also use in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All of the information was собрана and, even with the still unfinished test, surfaced interesting differences-simply put, the legislation we can be “precise and безошибочное”, but in practice we use on some measures, give in to Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows, therefore, that is not enough to create more and more уточненные rules, must focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As well as the project can help you, what it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is such a joint control can contribute to efforts to halt qualifications laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not result in a positive outcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means obtaining appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) the low price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we achieve this, lowering the limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps this system переполнится “bonds”, so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, they will find much easier than if the limit is not diminished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the internal problems of practical use legislation on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as the system functions control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is there such a body as our КРУ (checkpoints ревизионное management) or it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the institutions, there as our КРУ opposes Bundesrechnungshof, by our principle, there is also a panel, generating a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the authority to a certain extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are divisions in auditing and on the level of federal land-that their system is somewhat different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can manage only the federal money, the state means we have at hand.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal счетных Chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local legislation, there are easier than the us?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Indeed, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany could serve as a model, but it can certainly say that it is better for everyone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is so because they are dealing with better control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but повторюсь, such comparisons don't like me.</seg>
<seg id="31">But to say that even образцовые countries faced with many challenges.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not have received no benefits from our cooperation with офисом, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If talking about domestic legislation, as were reflected in your institution, the amendment to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it still does not show in our work to control.</seg>
<seg id="35">So as we are implementing controls on the need to take account of the fact that some of the delays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Take this into account only in the process of preparing the future tests, we have begun to use our new tool “detection of risk неэкономности”, through which we turned away almost 14,000 public contracts we examine their... there, of course, these changes will manifest itself, because the change in the cap, change the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">As you see, the claim that the law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is, of course, a step in the right direction, and, I hope, it is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which may arise, that the rules “ужесточатся” and they will be impossible to comply with.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the operation of the previous rules-controlled enterprises повязаны with provider (for example, the regional operational program — with the Regional Council) that any to uphold the law on public procurement means of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in such a case, strengthen the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think that's not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should be ruled out, those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the mistake, not on the formal влияющую decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then, as out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's recognize that this path will lead nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister announced that гдп will not be concerned about entrepreneurs audits of the so-called шварц system. — what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">“Schwartz-system” is prohibited or resolved?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be somehow appropriate, and if it is something bans, and the Prime Minister may not stand up to the work of regulators, who are expected to remain the responsibility of audit and seek to meet their obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">We can say: “we поменяем this law and this разрешим”, but you cannot say that, let's pretend that nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that will protect the public procurement..</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal disqualified only for formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but he must correctly applied, which, in my opinion, we are lacking.</seg>

<seg id="5">Moreover, in December, you are going to give a completely unique three концерта against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Could we tell you about this readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is about the national event fundraising, which we планируем here is already within two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has a calendar майя, about the end of December 21, which declared at 11: 10.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before the event, the 20th December in 21: 00 parallel стартуют three концерта in Prague, and Брно Остраве.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Those who came to a head this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially it was my idea, the further we all придумывали together with our художником Гонзой Аугустой.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apart from that, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to, together with the public think of the state of the world we once передадим our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of May calendar we have created a unique collection of goods from shoes, t-shirts, and the original сумок ключиков against the end of the world, these things can buy. at www. E-tap. cz and thereby together to support us.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The purchase of equipment for безбарьерного educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year so we work with civil association of Tap in Едлички Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly attend school students Institute Едлички and spend with them uplifting and interesting arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves have no money to go to преподавателям, and thus we seek to give them that opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">As part of the project, the construction of additional Едлички Institute in the future there will be a separate building, in which we переедем with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On every концерте committed several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to draw up a program that заинтересует all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, controlling Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with даном барта, the Tap Tap, Марьян Банго and Иржи Сухи.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of all the details can be seen at www. kpks. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Whether you are planning to any such “ambitious actions” in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, will be the first time stand on фестивале “Prague Spring” and here, of course, приготовим fun program with interesting гостями.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year, we would be delighted to have representation in the national чешском House in New York, and I personally, we will be in the US, is very much wanted to speak in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About заграницы you have serious plans, you already have in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">A group of the Tap Tap-this is the group of people with limited capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">As you справляетесь with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so scared, as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants in the electric инвалидных колясках, their коляски must travel in багажном secession, plus the large number of cargo and'with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, as long as these problems without s. czech airlines ČSA and british airline British Airways has always been famously prepared for us, how many times I удивляло.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to выездам overseas you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public relations for the disabled, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">With than you encountered by now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still on a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared with прагой in Moscow are many barriers, and there still is in диковинку самостоятельное travel on electric a wheelchair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is also not in the course of such banal things like give way to инвалиду clear.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there are already there are organizations that are trying to take people's attention to the problems of people with limited capabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Rather than in, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up to the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are so many things, the implementation of which far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to come, that the upgrading and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, who is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with a severe form of disability by moving on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, where everything …</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not a very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities to take an active role in public life, in this we them with the Tap Tap slightly опережаем!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but in the moment, when among us will appear well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">As long as this single cases — people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">A group of the Tap Tap in now is very popular, but back on two years ago, in 1998, you have forced her to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the Institute Едлички as воспитатель around me was a lot of young people who wanted to somehow address.</seg>
<seg id="60">And because I've музыкант and играю including at саксофоне, along with a colleague, organized an interesting Music кружок.</seg>
<seg id="61">Ah, but over time, says our leading Ладя Ангелович, this is a little bit out of control (смеется).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity of same came only in recent years, or I something путаю?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, we helped that we began to join the famous певцам and actively working on the propaganda of the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can assess, essentially as if there is no.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the European Union means we can afford skilled teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Whether you stood in front of the goal so well раскрутить The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In business, a lot of things-Shaw, подражающей one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all new accepted with caution, and it lasts for long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but I say that осмелюсь Tap Tap, one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, this is of course …</seg>
<seg id="72">But this very sorry излишня, because people with limited capabilities are not any dementia and all abandoned by individuals, which we should pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are the people who can live a life and, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities-as it is, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Обеспечило whether success that you strict head, what you think?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do work qualitatively, we should be in many things of hard-line and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I believe that this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly to make, and when learning that two times a week they should run on репетиции, visit подготовительные rates and spend a lot of time on the road, the very quickly lose enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the composition of the group the Tap Tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were in the early in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Ладя Ангелович.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open a group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have a desire and force of will, our door is always open.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, a meeting of ministers of the european space agency Poland was adopted the twentieth member of the european space agency as the second country from countries in the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of ЕКА 12 September 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with ЕКА in 1994, and for the next 40 years, took an active role in a series of projects to agencies.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the path to космосу Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before World War II, the polish enthusiasts were рейсами in space, but this is not always встречалось with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Напомню, for example, about the lecture and. Штернфельда, 6 December 1933 represented in Варшавской астрономической обсерватории ideas from his innovative work in “the introduction of космонавтику.”</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (1905, R.) left the audience lukewarm, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr Ian Гадомский was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the prize of Robert Эсно - Пельтри and André Luis Хирша for “bringing космонавтику.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Ian Гадомский (1899-1966), about which stated above, later became a great пропагандистом астрономии and космонавтики.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in Polish, magazines, hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Гадомский became known world пропагандистом космонавтики, and his contribution was the coverage including the one on the opposite side of the moon кратеров was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built rail дрезина, missile-equipped vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear, even to break or to drag carts, was to be used rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this дрезине known only from the press that era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began thinking about missile стрелах.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study logistics секция weapons technology in conjunction with professors Мечиславом Вольфке and Густавом Мокжицким.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the lingering materials, studies have reached that stage of the practical test.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of german troops work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in специализированной press came the idea of фотоэлектрической missiles-fighter, which proposed the engineer Рогозинский, and in the next year to work out the “air missile торпеда авиационная rocket-and-bomb” author Леливы - Кживоблоцкого.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war, all the projects military use missile technology in a temporary research and advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, devoted to space achievements, appeared in the polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the polish society астронавтики (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time, about the society is mentioned in November 1954 Andrews magazine “problem”, in which four публикуются wordy article on астронавтике.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, a professor of M. Суботович has proposed a society that will engage космонавтикой.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already набирали momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research - перспективная industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the start of the 1956 polish society астронавтики (ПОА) tried to join the international federation астронавтики (founded in 1951), and is already in the autumn ПОА became its actual member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the next year, the first chairman of the ПОА Казимеж Заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of астронавтики.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he remained until the time of his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">With the 1956 ПОА contributed a significant contribution in the development of a highly successful метеорологической missiles RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile выполнившей scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM-1 has been completed in 1957, and the launch of the first took place 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket, to overcome the distance 1800 M, was about 80 centimeters in length, and her weight was less than 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently, was built and improved version of the RM-1А, and in the summer of 1959 on Бледовском пустыре were conducted tests двухступенчатой missiles RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was in length of about 1.4 M, and her weight was approximately 11,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the missiles was already in a position to do the real work of rocket science-RM-34 could overcome on line, and its task was watching the high-rise ветром.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The first type of missiles Наследницей RM has become a rocket метеор - 1, which was devised in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.</seg>
<seg id="39">Rocket was meant as двухступенчатая, its overall длина was 510 centimeters, and the initial weight-32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Were developed three types of (обозначенные as метеор - 1А, 1В - and-1С), the size of which различались chambers for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rocket метеор - 1А were appropriated space worth 0.4 L, метеор - 1В 0,34 L-and - метеор 1С - 0,62л.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range from all three types of was 37 kilometers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968, Aircraft Building Corporation in the development of missiles from метеор - 2, and its first летные tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket метеор - 2 with стартовым 380 kg weight was able to withdraw a useful cargo weight of 10 kg on dropped about 60 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built versions of метеор 2Н метеор - and-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Should also mention membership in КОСПАР (Committee on Space) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee КОСПАР two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, within the framework of Интеркосмос, Poland joined in the research of outer space on soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the polish pilot Mirek Гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека.</seg>

<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public work is not a solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled a law about public work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution has caused оживленную debate in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at this проблематику with a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unconstrained by the private capital, together with unrestrained financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the significant difference in the cost of the labor force (wage) raises the price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept should be aware of when a producer, through the delivery of cheap goods to withstand the economic competition that “bashing” the value of a rival to take a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the massive scale of this means for most entrepreneurs or extending the production overseas, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance of rises in unemployment as a result of those in countries where the cost of labor, compared with other high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital does not bear no social responsibility, including that produced them and for unemployment, rising unavoidable state spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of similar businesses pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social damage caused in their pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that you do not need to make a concrete statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Бесцеремонные methods of private capital to create the economies of individual states, when governments are forced to join in competition with each other, to artificially reduce social level of its population in the country, with the aim of attracting foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government's own population is at the discretion of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected, above all in the changes of the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to make its economically ​​народ diktat of private capital, above all in the field of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the area of labor law.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of the increasing levels of poverty and, along with that, and the gap between the poor and the rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany for several years, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already close to a million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In terms of the competitiveness of the german economy is constantly presented cases, when employed people receive a salary, that the state they should доплачивать, they received a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">This scandal has become known to the public, and, in the case of additional workers needed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in nearly all of the southern states of the EU, will result in the same state, in which people, who are under pressure from the crash of social status, or forced to value, as it was in the 19th century flushed, or exist in нищенскую salary at society's backyard in the hope that someday in the country come to private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But спрашивается, where does it take?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the chinese, indian, Brazilian, Turks, марокканец, egyptian, African still works for a share of european wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the media to nauseam argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of their own agriculture-driven economy that leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not the managers of the action to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then, should answer the question, not in the private capital is now virtually the entire policy, and the governor of the state, in its own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">Explicit answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is the existence of the almost all-powerful lobbies and omnipresent in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, we have a situation, безысходную проявляющуюся in corruption, ensure mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department because of a lack of financial means поручают drafting legislation to private legal firms, which are tied to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills argues the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">The entire power comes not from the people, as the constitution of western-style, and from the powerful groups, to their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly in such ​​ситуации, as it is described by Аппианом произведении in “crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar's and Помпея”: “the state has long held together, and did not engage in violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal obtaining милостей with stones and by.</seg>
<seg id="39">Graft and corruption flourished without the bans, and went on to a pre-election люд проданным voice”” … порядочные people not баллотировались as ruler, at the end of the day the state for eight months left without the Consul.”... “seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the need for choice energetic human “.. Аппиан thought that this would be Помпей, but they became цезарь, who has replaced the democracy on an autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in древности, in modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is inherently not intended for use in public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">The current outcome is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">It means to cause of fascist and communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization systems, 19 and 20 centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">To date, the absence of these regimes, and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain type of pausing, after which is expected to be the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Above all, tragically, the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, or at least, not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both on the international and national and european levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level.</seg>
<seg id="48">So the trend is systemic in nature.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is a specific political and social reforms that will strengthen долевое state participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, the crowd of islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Резы Пехлеви бежавшего, after the revolution in the US, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the US administration a positive outcome of the situation not to, she could not afford to dismiss Shah overboard because that is at the root of the allies could undermine confidence in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was reinforced by the botched the release of the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Inmates diplomats were finally released after 444 days after talks brokered by the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity at home and антииранских sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election-year, completed the election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, срежессированный актером Ben Аффлеком “Operation Арго” describes one of the episodes in the history of America, which brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of six embassy workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After they completed the complex further twists its way in the embassies of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, it has helped экстравагантная legend dressing, according to which they выехали on canadian passports as members of the production team in place for the country, подыскивавшие съемок - fantastic epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of жанров</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert “evacuation” Tony Мендес, asking for cooperation in Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To legend was accurate, in specialized journals have been about the film, устраивались press conference, the fictional manufacturing company, had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Мендеса.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Аффлека - this particular combination of several жанров.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called “film - киноопус”, the history of successful затеи, bubble-example may be a series of films about friends Оушена.</seg>
<seg id="20">The film constantly change the mood-on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes from Tehran (титрах shown знаковые historical photos, events and the way that those same situation were продемонстрированы in film — big differences in this not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, Hollywood облегченные fragments, пересекающиеся with irony and moderate exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions-the men in suits, discussing the situation for tables, negotiations on лестницах institutions, on the phone …</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Бену Аффлеку gloriously failed to make рестарт careers.</seg>
<seg id="24">From высмеянного actor became a respected режиссером, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Operation Арго” his third полнометражный film, after the tragic детектива “say good-bye to, детка, say good-bye to” (2007) and “триллера city” (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first film Аффлека, who remains in his hometown of the filmmaker-Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sense of the atmosphere in the room this refers to the taste, which возвышали earlier films director over голливудским standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And it shows in the “Аффлек Арго”, where Tehran “plays” in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film are occurring on the streets, with the reconstruction of real events — the entrance scenes of the embassies of his impressive clarity, which also captures the confusion and непредвиденности emotions that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.</seg>
<seg id="30">Similar effect Аффлек and his colleagues are in сценах s fictional (fake headquarters in Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Режиссеру had to deal with that narrative suggests many exciting scenes кинематографического meaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">He is successfully working with this little, sometimes something додумывает - there all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a telephone call in America, prevents the impending crisis in Tehran's airport, and the chase on runways посадочной page look quite надуманно).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The lack of “Арго” is absent, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Аркин and John Гудман in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very обаятельны, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are in the film is far from the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film Аффлека lacks a little драматизма, this film, which can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing постановку and retro-style, воссоздающий триллеры 1970.</seg>
<seg id="37">But exciting.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, that is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, and also for evidence, as exaggerated notions of the all-powerful and всезнающих спецслужбах.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I say all the time that включусь in a fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I уточнил, if that will be elected senator, will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not the position, a position-it is a tool through which I can make their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I need the most influence and широчайшие powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation ропщем themselves in a bar or watching tv, but with this ready растоптать any who try something has to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this добавляются media that human очерняют, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, about me saying that I даю bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to the Иржи Пароубека.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Turn to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fight for the presidential castle you started with the thesis of the material and the criminal responsibility of politicians and about обратных property of the above $20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to do this, we need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have no such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">As you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I, as a citizen of the lobbying to holding экскурсий became free enterprise, it failed to advance.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in политиканстве - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately чинят obstacles, and that is holding back the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent беспартийного person I am far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have an advantage in that I without party раскладывания on полочкам, irrespective of the tenets can take from each party, what is best for our country, and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see a person, more relevant to the right or to the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">With the Czech's point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to blame me for the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, not at all important-a little to the left or the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important that we were going forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not about what someone refers to the right, and to the left, I want to unite people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always assistance of any good for society, whether his decision to propose КПЧМ or гдп, and I just go against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You злитесь, when someone says that you are a populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But not доказываете you this is what you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you создаете business plan for firms, you also have some ideal goal and views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And for this you стараетесь converge.</seg>
<seg id="37">We can call this populism, but all the proposals, to which I say, already operate in the world, or the prominent experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that, in politics, you cannot long продержитесь.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you выйдете to people and поговорите with them, you will realize the material and criminally responsible?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to lure away them on their side, that we have made.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, it would establish the direct tv ways in which I draw on председателям parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminally responsible for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they, in case of failure, should be told why it does not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality, which makes the abuses, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president – that was the achievement of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">To say directly that I любитель, not a genius and not an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies, to stand up for their beliefs and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I only amateur in politics, and for his program попытаюсь gain the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">Things I try to push their own; in that case, if this fails, through six years закончу and go back to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is, in part, it sounds as if Окамура should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm not no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that, one, I will do nothing, so I ignored a number of famous people with offering a run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused, in connection with a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I at least supported leading investigations журналистку Jan Лоренцову, which exposed the fraud with light fuel Asia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I put forward his candidacy because people and really неудовлетворены, but now I feel themselves on the scales.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people are not going to vote, and the majority of those who have opted for the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us independents in the Senate, only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You think about the basis of his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about this, because I have no time to screen the purity of the past every potential supporter, and I have no money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent run only twenty thousand крон.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about the property, and how are your own affairs with this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Personal wealth is estimated at $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a station in Prague, at a cost of around $25 million, headquartered in 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, коллекция art of approximately 10 million, Астон - Martin at 3.5 million and шкода Суперб per million, well, and even a few million on account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally Астон - Martin I have emerged, because this was my мальчишечья dream-I always liked Джэймс Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women, and at the same time fought against over villainy and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You ездите on Астон - мартине, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money in this particularly don't want to invest.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15-60 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I must inject themselves in debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign, I have already invested $2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program not so интересна.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Spending on the campaign, I essentially покроет сенаторская salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But on this money, I would have not had lived, for example, could not pay for the son of a british school, which is 30 thousand a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to earn money, so nowhere would not ran.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Thus, you will continue to do business, to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Wouldn't you not saying that reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of salaries.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, and their activities I partly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the Managing Director of tourist agencies in the spring will be my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would have wanted to, that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to something live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, how the entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two to четырехсот thousands that получаю and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I become president, his business would be finished.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects of the MVRDV argue that the real adventure is not only in the imagination of Спейкениссе and his recently built the book mountains-2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">“It seems to me the building веселым, it looks футуристично, finally we have once again we can see something interesting,” says Лизетте Верхайг прохожая, on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Stephane Спермон, a specialist on it based on nearby major venture, believes so: “no, this building is really good.”</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder: why do we now another library?</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has the Internet, ipads and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, no one has already voluntarily not enter such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному городку under роттердамом, belongs to an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population numbers 80.000 people has a very low level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To deal with this always: a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution to the overall education and build seven s fictional bridges, who portrayed on the euro notes, in the form of живописно раскрашенных миниатюр from железобетона.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this initiative просветительской was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers realized that it was the only way to break the grip of statistics: build here библиотеку!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Вини Маас from роттердамского архитектурного bureau MVRDV, Master of the courageous столбчатых диаграмм and author of clever, sometimes even cynical построек, snubbed by the task with his usual невозмутимостью and appeared on конкурсном opposition research in 2003 with five books under мышкой and ухмылкой on its face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And so, as the members of the judges озадаченно оглядывались and shrugged, дерзкий Маас сложил from its original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in his project of the following words: “respected townspeople!”</seg>
<seg id="14">This is it, my proposal: “книжная Gore” in Спейкениссе, the so-called Букенберг!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">After nine years of this mountain of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the project, which also includes ревитализации underground гараж, supermarket, mail and several surrounding them home prices and таунхаусов a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, “книжная Gore” was marked by a second Prize competition “the best library in the Netherlands of 2012 .”</seg>
<seg id="18">The project also participates in the dutch national конкурсе wooden equipment 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, безликий пригород, which previously could not offer nothing but the post-modern pedestrian zone and surprisingly некрасивой ратуши, white facades which suggest a молокозаводе, has become richer, the one thing the modern architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But most important of all-in Спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impressions: книжное Эльдорадо under колпаком for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="23">There was only one, in the center of the лифт проходящий горного array, for the real aficionados of the architecture and reading choose to explore the countryside пешком.</seg>
<seg id="24">Остекленное from all sides-removal светлое and easily foreseeable, floors of обожженного Hinduism asserts and many street lights unmistakably creates a sense of public urban area.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment воссоздана perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="26">View unwittingly seek скамейки, dogs and are in the football boys and девчонок.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere-books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">“Usually the deficit shelf are along the facades, and are located in the middle of a dark hall, typically неуютный and безликий,” says вини Маас.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have put a classic sense of space on its head and lift the zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Domestic space of the book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the host offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental and technical center locations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially радуют black deficit shelf, which serve the отделкой walls, парапетами, лестничными перилами.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their sights and smells текстура peculiar.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated architects and engineers, construction workers lost in more than guesswork, what it is for unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">“We tried to work with the secondary materials,” explains Йоп Трауборст, head of the project, representing the community of Спейкениссе, in line with the demands of a standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once again on the same agrarian venture in Фрисландии we met a by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in теплицах and on the fields in the Netherlands as подкладки under roots applied artificial волокнистый material миллиметровой толщины.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">A delicate textiles, serves a one-two of the season, after that it can emit.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the first time in this library полотно - such volumes-was спрессовано in панели толщиной four сантиметра.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the impact of the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) into the dark, homogenous, the sound of the material, a bit like a new car and запаху little sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top are 105 ступеней.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who преодолеет path-almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in литературном cafes not only fantastic species in the city, but also the dutch крокетами and древесными фикусами in window.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, and in the first part of the right humidity air on literary woe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The costs for a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“It's hard to believe, but this is a building, despite many стеклянных structures, represents образцовый project in terms of ecology,” says Троуборст.</seg>
<seg id="46">For his отопления and cooling the Earth is used.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although книжная Gore is under glass колпаком, even in the clear days the sun falls into the only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Vast farms of клееной timber, lying перпендикулярно стеклянному фасаду, provide shade and take on more of the solar rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in помещении very palatable.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the defense provides a fully automatic рулонные шторы.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stephane Спермон, упоминавшийся above скептик from it, has already visited the new библиотеку.</seg>
<seg id="52">Лизетте Верхайг also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as the traditional chinese medicine преподавательница Синтия Богард, which is called “the soul of Букенберг Спейкениссе, which has long lacked.”</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: a few weeks before the opening of every citizen has received an invitation to sacrifice one of their own book.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were to occupy the empty seats on the shelves are not yet fully укомплектованной library-at the time it was 70.000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelf заставлены доверху.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">“There is nothing worse than полупустая library,” says the architect вини Маас.</seg>
<seg id="59">“I think that, thanks to our invitation now every citizen in some ways is associated with this new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it only serves to.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Спейкениссе wrote his литературную history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And even though they are very young and необразованны.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is, after all, only the initial point for english identity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Сабо: “the Germans should play a more important role”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Сабо, an expert on the relationship between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow the diplomatic path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Most Welle: in the early weeks, Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of the Palestinians to get observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin refrained voting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Стефен Сабо: Germany does not support israeli actions in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that the american position, it also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – while not speaking too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the imposition of no-fly zones.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is true.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact is that it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, and it is moving from the policy, which is to say, by the US, to strictly german foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans lack a coherent single policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to this.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that, as long as they only нащупывают its role, but are on the road to a more “normal” foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy, which holds France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly is the “normal” foreign policy from the german point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This willingness to borrow in its national interest, is not dependent on the US or european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the german foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other big states, and so Germany must defend their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The tables are the economic interests of the position in the Middle East conflict, and for a vote in the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="27">So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and elite in arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not attached to the far too much weight, it is not entirely one-sided link.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, воздерживаясь when important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am confident that, in Europe and even in the United States, the majority of the german position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I do not think that this was the same dramatic надлом, as the libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany may even become so a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, this is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests entails reckoned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, clearly have voiced support for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a divergence of opinion between the US and many european states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In the power of american domestic politics, such differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that Obama's government in the back of their minds has sufficient understanding of the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, can't openly hold such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that a significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, the reply that Obama is not enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is easy to whether Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes it such a difficult situation for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, непротиворечивая european policy, but now it is not.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can't stand as part of a broader approach and instead are forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is because they are doing to the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that, in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in forging a common european position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, because of ties with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This theme has always been щекотливой.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player-not to take it on a really major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or the leadership role is still hard to give Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed to this, it still always a disappointment and, for obvious reasons, so far always comes, it is hard to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis – each time, when Germany assume the important role that lends itself to the various антигерманские feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans are not just deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Indeed, it is an old problem: you do not want to be is surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than that of the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must take into account the different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the influence of the United States in european politics has diminished, but at the moment the EU is not supplied this vacuum, who remains the same, then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like it, not pleasant or reinforces нелюбовь to you-this is life!</seg>

<seg id="10">So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead Wears Prada can file-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">This same way legally they are copied german enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.</seg>

<seg id="21">“This damages the business, with the need to fight,” convinced Паттлох.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Trade Mark размывается, unique position flotations, image very much suffering.”</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of the expensive копируемых products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to market research company CLSA China, with volume sales of 15 billion euros in the year, is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">But achieving undoing of dubious records in реестре trade execution is difficult, and it is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Паттлох recounts affairs, in which the court rejected claims, as the first long опротестованное name became “реалией market.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If not истцу is lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору, as his знаку damaged the trade in China, says Паттлох.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes, the law of the jungle rules here.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also the famous case of графических elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with the producer of construction machines, Sany, a business that, shortly before the firm acquired-producer бетононасосов Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the Chinese still have the right to use эмблему, similar to the Mercedes, star.</seg>
<seg id="33">Купившая Volvo company Geely originally used сине - white логотип, напоминавший BMWS; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">A producer of fancy goods Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which has the famous крокодил looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">Agency records of commodity signs CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010, because of a lack of personnel and equipment and there have been setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the past year has “return from emergency workers in the process to normalcy.”</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the number of cases has dropped objections необработанных at 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed almost 57.000 such affairs, 75% more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Yet 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in ведомстве.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To deal with this is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year in CTMO comes more than 1.4 million claims about protecting trade execution, nearly a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record and means that China in ten consecutive time led the list of new регистраций all around the world, the agency reports.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same goes for the total number of actual trade execution, only 5.5 million штук.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, was to pay out £1.8 billion yuan fee.</seg>
<seg id="47">If simplify, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Опротестовать its worth many times more, as it shows the german family enterprises Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, owned fights against the chinese плагиатора.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans have done, that the illegal production of them fake auto parts was gone.</seg>
<seg id="51">But имитатор secured for a chinese rights on the trade mark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">This was an oversight of their own, so as not to be protecting Bin in Germany, says Ханно Вентцлер, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the agency records of trade execution CTMO rejected претензию мюнхенцев.</seg>
<seg id="54">The truth, in both the next инстанциях Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Need to be on guard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question now is for review in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Вентцлер hopes to bring it to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: “the process extremely roads and take what we have plenty of time, money, and the nerve.”</seg>
<seg id="59">Domestic spending is unlikely to succumb to the учету, архиву firms had to просмотреть even a century ago, acts to bring evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg inconclusively proposed противной side of “greater шестизначную amount in euros” for a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">“Hence, it is clear how costly that we should,” says Вентцлер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East threatened to infect even in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And it is in that case, if имитаторы register there for a soft trading signs.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to file наименование Freudenberg for shoes and products from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="65">Owned long ago ceased production in these areas, but despite that failed to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">“The need to be vigilant,” says Вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="67">As he and the lawyer Паттлох recommend german businesses to be very cautious with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international regulations protecting commodity signs, more foreigners should be “all that somehow it is worth defending, registering also in China,” says Вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it may prove to be worth far more than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the Freudenberg lose in the last act of his drama about signs of the trade, it should pay противной side лицензионные fees for its own name, explains Вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise, we drive away from the market in спорном сегменте.</seg>

<seg id="9">Fifty members of the choir on репетицию came from 23 to 69 years, from специалистки on human genetics to дворника.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Th” Обани” — not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to completely чуждом language: зулусском, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Aid for самопомощи</seg>

<seg id="12">According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations program on AIDS in the world, there are about 34 million people infected with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="13">23,5 million of them live in southern Africa.</seg>

<seg id="16">For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Эситжени group Voices for Africa has found шефов in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend school, готовящую to further education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros a month, one can assume шефство.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees the child money to school, school uniforms and day-to-day hot lunch in Гого - center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Имбонги on зулусском language means рассказчик or восхвалитель.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this chamber does not speak fluent on банту, but are good at singing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost ten years of chorus of разучивает songs on this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, the length of the summer 8733 kilometers from Хайдельберга, in the northwest of the Kingdom's Swaziland, is the village Эситжени, which depends on the votes of the german choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent of Инфицированы</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There are about 2,000 people, some still in ordinary хижинах from глины and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus ИЧ.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Эситжени, reflected in the disease: the highest level of Swaziland is HIV infection, has the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Circumcision at flesh in men, which reduces the risk of contagion доказанно, half the population is almost taken.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the population in Swaziland are themselves using, death in the mid-fourth decade-are not rare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The chorus of opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Имбогни saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only родительской concerns, but simply: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without a school education a person has in a poor country, there is no chance at all.</seg>
<seg id="32">First it was the commitment of private individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get hot food.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later, the chorus of a unification “Voices for Africa”, which has since almost профессионально cares about сиротах AIDS in Эситжени.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about инфекциях, sexually transmitted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important, sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">To dismiss бактериальным ИППП сифилис, хламидиоз and триппер (гонорею).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral ИППП are HIV, the human папиллома - virus, генитальный герпес and гепатит.</seg>
<seg id="38">Лобковый педикулез and чесотка belong to паразитарным ИППП.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the major поражаемые groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Сифилис and гонорея meet mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute of Robert коха comes from what the least in four out of every five cases сифилиса, registered in Germany, the transition is happening as a result of sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">The гетеросексуальных adults often встречающимися illnesses передающимися sexually, are хламидийные infection, трихомониаз, кандидоз (грибок), гонорея and human папиллома - virus.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among гетеросексуальных adults we have relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV заражений falls on this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Youth хламидийные infection are significantly more often than among other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the data, three-quarters of all infections hit young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have the youth also often meets human папиллома - virus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As is changing the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the disease, transmitted sexually, are subject to mandatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">Incidence of сифилисом, according to the Institute of Robert коха, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV заражений since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is roughly one-tenth of one less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">With infectious diseases can arise canker in the area of genital mutilation, complaints with мочеиспускании, throwing, pain, bottom живота, and also the will or уплотнения.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they are not accompanied by болями and other symptoms and remain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can we protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but it does not provide стопроцентной protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">After all, partly возбудители diseases, передающихся sexually, can also spread through контактной infection and in close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">So experts recommend regular check-ups, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">With early diagnosis can be cured most ИППП and avoid the consequences of the remote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Шефство, donations and not in the least fees charged for speech choir across Germany allow something up.</seg>
<seg id="62">“All we have sent in Эситжени already roughly 200,000 euros,” says Аннете Леннартц, Chairman of unification.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village of money from Germany ordering Цодва Дламини, conscious and an active woman.</seg>
<seg id="64">She cares about the orphans were well-built up, for example in one of бабушек.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Гогос, call on зулусском old women, this pillar of the villages.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have taken to him to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and making sure that, in the form of children every day in time came from.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who are not left home, coming in to the orphanage Ханийсиле, lonely woman, being paid from associations, as well as two поварихи that every day, prepare for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Moreover, the “Voices for Africa” organized a швейную school построило two курятника and, together with the american institution to protect public health PSI organized a surrender of analysis on HIV for many residents of the villages.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident across the country, prefer deep silence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">King with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Аннете Леннартц, “because it has to do with sexuality.”</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusually for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Мсвати III, known for his fondness for излишествам.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy, instead of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such санкционированном state-style life also lays the blame for what the virus ИЧ so quickly spread in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is also the бродячих workers разносят virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms are literally on every street corner, says Аннете Леннартц, “but they almost do not use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture-flesh to flesh.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to maintain a bit of cultural exchange, the chorus of Ибмогни every two or three years, making a trip to South Africa and поет songs, full of грусти, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern corner of the black continent know even since the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus, full of white, singing a song in the black language-such recognition not only brings a good mood and rejoicing, but, even so, engendering tears in the eyes of the strictest пограничников.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Trip always also leads in Эситжени, where певцы подшефных children attend.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite that, a small village with a hard-to-can be found on the map, in the River Valley Эцулвени it more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Идите in Эситжени, light,” said здешние people.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after-8733 километрового flying time back in Хайдельберг when топающие певцы returning in репетиционный hall on the street Бергхаймер, we can see that this light on fire and also here.</seg>

<seg id="7">The search for разгадки in a country where 97-year-old старцы seem still relatively young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The journey through Талышские mountains can be called wild and романтичной.</seg>
<seg id="9">Микроавтобус with громыханием headed on the road past извилистой заросших by dense forests, the turbulent речек and ordinary peasant houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">All around so зелено and vividly that, one might think that is in Шварцвальде.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But it is the southern edge Azerbaijan, Iran's border is only a few kilometers from there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here live талыши is one of the nations of the Caucasus, about which little is known, is just what they do and say on фарси азербайжданском and different долголетием.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The final point is Лерик.</seg>
<seg id="14">Small town кичится too heavy architecture of soviet times, which is not harmony with живописным mountain ландшафтом.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe's almost not coming here, the road from the capital Baku азербайджанской утомительна too.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 323 miles away eight hours, as the road is only one page.</seg>
<seg id="17">Легендарное wealth, which the authors of the Caspian Sea oil, here, in the province, while not добралось.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">But Пилата Фатулаева (48) convinced that Лерике than there is in the interest of tourists.</seg>
<seg id="19">“In May, Baku Welch фестивалем songs of the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we will meet other the oldest people in the world,” says Фатулаева.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the director of the museum longevity, probably the only in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here задокументирована biography of roughly eight dozen талышей of these seats, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white picture.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, he here 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the age of 136 years it has another child was born</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But the controversial star of the museum is чабан Ширали Мюслюмов, which allegedly marked the 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">Birth certificates, however, is not.</seg>
<seg id="26">And given that старейшему man, whose age подтвержден files, marked the 12 years of age, is extremely dubious Мюслюмова.</seg>
<seg id="27">“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” explains Фатулаева.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was is married three times, and he had a child at the age of 23, 136 years he allegedly was born daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">So whether чабан Мюслюмов added a couple of decades to its age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After all, even Рембрандт Шольц, researcher in the age of the Institute of Max Ростоке, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">“A lot of people have advanced age can be found in some areas of China, Japan or the valley Хунза in Pakistan,” says Шольц, “on сардинии also live extremely many very old people.”</seg>
<seg id="32">However, because of a lack of documents the scientific confirmation of age is impossible, because there was no реестров civil state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day, a glass everywhere</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the district of Лерика strikingly often reaches the biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now here 20 people over the age of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why here, in the south, so many долгожителей?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Azerbaijani экскурсовод Fareed Мугимзаде explains this special genes талышей.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum Фатулаева, by contrast, believes that the deal in nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Талыши like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them on выпивают стакану everywhere, every day, but hardly a высококалорийная diet can be healthier with диетологической'point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or, in the case of первобытном lifestyle that keeps people in youth? Ченгемиране, tiny селении not far from the city's Лерик, live Рубаба мирзоева.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 97 years, it is still relatively young for these широт.</seg>
<seg id="42">Мирзаева, which argues that it has 143 потомка, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It sits in the semi with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает 94-here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Here, under one крышей live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Мирзаевой, which long ago already have their grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also nearby скачут two малышей.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the kitchen guests prepare tea, which shows in the typical пузатых стаканах армуду.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The Мирзаевой perfectly flat 2011 and the solid white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark русые косы that her son proudly reveals before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always have my hair молоком, so that they never выпадали and retained the color.</seg>
<seg id="49">“And I never enjoyed шампунем,” says Мирзаева.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="51">She always ела only that grew in its own backyard, tomatoes, картофель, горошек.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Propaganda is frequently in the speeches of the old women.</seg>
<seg id="57">But the cult of the father of the nation, conceived around figures, who rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.</seg>

<seg id="11">Mohammed Morsi, hardly извиняясь, said that he temporarily cut the competencies Constitutional Court and expand its authority, “to save the revolution.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a degree of american doctors of the University of Southern California, is not entirely clear egyptians and the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Whether out of the forces of the judiciary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact 234 articles have quietly in ночной 15-hour скачке with impediments to исламистски настроенном Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly the cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings relies on the “principles of islamic law”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But that means “principles”?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists would use the blurred wording and the emerging in connection with her legal люфт for a strict interpretation of Shari'a.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At the very least, it suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters concerning the Sharia, should attract for the Council of the University of Al - Ашар, Supply islamist institution of the country, something more authority in Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">This should not, but could mean that the clergy надзирает for legislation that de facto would be the limit of the judiciary.</seg>

<seg id="6">Leave them there for недельку.</seg>
<seg id="7">You could smell отшибающий обоняние ракфиска - one of the world's most famous норвежских деликатесов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in a small town called Фагернес, in three hours away from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around covered in snow живописные. this is a very good, but in the air разлит неистребимый signature smell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Ракфиск is форель, посыпанная солью and бродившая in water up to a year, depending on how it is душка needed to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As the massing сумерки and холодает, crowds gather on the other in норвежцев Фагернесе devoted to this himself, say so, захватывающему блюду.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“Her eating raw and запивают рюмкой аквавита, local тминной vodka,” explains Хавард Хальварсен, local пожарный profession and moonlighting ракфисковый “General”, which is holding a festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us, people eat нарезанную кубиками small fish and its запивают немалыми спиртного portions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“Someone more like аквавит than ракфиск,” says Хавард.</seg>
<seg id="15">This напиток перебить can smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have a couple of пробую shreds.</seg>
<seg id="17">If пронести piece under the noses, everything is not all bad – than a little different from the serving sushi, which you long возили with a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ракфиск - this is the Norwegian product from completely other times, the poverty, when, even before the advent of the холодильников, fish in the autumn замачивали герметически closed бочках соленой with water.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then a deep in the winter, when fish are already well and thoroughly забродила, it removed and, приглушив perception of alcohol, consumed in food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of норвежцев were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrating, mainly in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now, as the population rapidly grows more than 13% are immigrants, which involve these jobs, higher wages and advanced social welfare system.</seg>
<seg id="22">Residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, and yet not so long ago and far more зажиточного neighbor) en masse coming here to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ракфиск is seen as some kind of an important symbol, непременный, albeit somewhat зловонный element of past Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is one of the most expensive local dishes.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, there are expensive – small бокал beer or сандвич would cost you in 9 pounds sterling ($14).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway has rarely appeared in the world news, and most of the country, it seems, please.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">People here still reluctant to mention the name of the general, Anders Breivik, the right-wing экстремиста расиста and, in the past year расстрелявшего and kills 77 men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Not to mention his name, the original called “what happened on July 22 .”</seg>
<seg id="29">Норвежцам it is very difficult to believe that, in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens has proven to be capable of such atrocities and killing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the heart of today's well-Norway is growth (since 1970), one of the largest нефтегазовых industries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our g, разносящая подносы with выдержанным ракфиском, a woman with long светлыми hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of нордического prosperity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We the people – as you call it – рассудительный.</seg>
<seg id="33">Like most норвежцев, it perfectly speaks English.</seg>
<seg id="34">We do not love выставляться on display, we not хвастливы.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway's very Nehru carefully treats its oil revenues, much of the oil industry invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the years before the financial crisis, when all the World сорили money, which they have not been, Norway бережливо подсчитывала all costs.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening awaits us even more of the same fish with незабываемым odor.</seg>
<seg id="42">In my hotel spend special ужин devoted to ракфиск, in which visitors votes determine the best or, perhaps, the most ароматную fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is direct телеэфир, in which the show's top wearing a tie - бабочке, surrounded by тарелками with ракфиском.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like песенный competition “Eurovision Song Contest.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“So, тор - Jürgen assessment of what you put in the best fish there, up in the mountains?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">“Yes, this is our assessment Хавард,” …</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination-American narrative of mexican descent.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to implement themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind people of the country's complex time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Рубен Наваретте believes that Mexicans of american origin разрываются between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed on коридору for coming, close to the border controls and stalled on the spot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs point to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in Central California, and my entire life called мексиканцем.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is simply a contingent name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New York to see themselves as the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I stopped at the complex design “American of mexican origin.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, at home, my grandfather, there was no need for provisional titles or complex конструкциях.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply the American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I say speaking Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary of poorer than the carriers of the language, and I can't get rid of the american emphasis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Because I достал his american passport and was in place for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered the story a few days ago, when the president-elect of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda was usual for meetings of the presidents of these issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The president of Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of Mexico's economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will remain in Mexico, instead, to перебираться in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and create some североамериканский trade bloc like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, the president of Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not hit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States is hard and old scores исполненный question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have never thought about that, in 1848, the United States moved to Mexico and under дулом винтовок forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans minded centuries, not минутами, and see reminders of those events around.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So it is only of any US state деятелю обмолвиться any word of criticism in the side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the mexican society here, there are complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants Монтесумы преисполняются воинственностью.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In this most complex relations with Mexico are more than 35 million Americans of mexican descent living in the US.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the grievances?</seg>
<seg id="29">Their enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people who find themselves in this country for opportunities, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, фениксе, Denver or San Antonio so many people of mexican descent and only for one reason: at some point, their family history anyone-father or grandfather-not having to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most of all, it was a certain type of Mexicans — смуглые, малообразованные, from poor farming families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about this.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico, see it differently.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the american dream, we studied in good schools and good work on устроились, but we do not forget that even this dream-America, not Mexico's.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination muddled and unclear, but we know what to believe their country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the mexican elite ruling class, and we do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">We are with them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the degrading поражениях and refer to us as a people, as a second-class ненастоящим Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not talking about well-speaking Spanish, and our ties with Mexico are not strong.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them because of the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would now for шелковым fog, finding in the US сытую life, but having lost the spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved in the United States even in childhood, and it reminds me of that, between the real Mexicans and Americans of mexican descent, there is some friction-Mex четче understand their national identity, and Americans of mexican descent this обидно.</seg>
<seg id="46">She гражданка US and believes that belongs to both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, I know many Americans of mexican descent does not feel neither belonging to one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We слушаем mexican group the Tigres del Norte, but love and Брюса Спрингстина.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lost roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the us we call Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relationship is not enough without the intertwined, some mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans to the mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell their friends-Americans, which is a great country, and how nice of her to attend, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Ага, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing will come.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many grievances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and binge outlets, many of us do not believe this country too great.</seg>
<seg id="59">I'm sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, амигос.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If the majority of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States, as they did with half-a - century ago, Mexico, and they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of mexican descent still in обиде for, most recently in Mexico with the interests of their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes, definitely.</seg>
<seg id="63">If anything, we have more in common than it seemed to me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles in the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is possible to long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are, as a conventional, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings ruined; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, with the territory of Gaza rockets have fallen in neighborhoods of the capital of Israel's Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East have change.</seg>
<seg id="7">This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” закружили мятежной storm in many well-established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to remain aloof from вихря, shaken the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even more bloody than previously.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons that offer hope for a way out of this impasse mortal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the current situation does not give cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed by 21 November, will be honored, occurred this week clashes only strengthened siloviki on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, chat to power in Gaza in 2007, 2008 from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the losses they incurred.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas expands its popularity in the West Bank is one of the Palestinian-controlled territory currently in the more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that the time to work on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the influence of islamist movements in the arab world, Hamas creates new powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">A resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among muslim countries, has the support of Hamas; it followed the example of Qatar, one of the richest and carried states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Торжествующие supporters of Hamas' claim of an islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, in which governs militarized group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels to overthrow the rule of Bashar Assad's, and then to Jordan, where the king's power to Hamas' s allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant change in the balance of power in the region happened on Israel's southern border, in the most populous and important arab country, in Egypt, where President Morsi Мухаммеде strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention support for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are, in many ways a parallel with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future, the diplomatic расстановках Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice is not able to damp down even Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, supporters of the “hard-line” in Israel will come to different conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas was повержен.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israeli missile system “Iron купол” justified its creation and successfully destroyed many of the agent of Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the US remained committed to their fixed positions; many european countries also assigned blame for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular with Binyamin Netanyahu's government, which has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis killed by missiles, produced by a delegation from Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes on the territory of the West Bank, a large part of the непризнанного palestinian state-and protects the jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such action from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party-as part of the preparations for the looming on 22 January elections-teamed up with even more aggressively-conservatives under Авигдора lieberman, quite удобна.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and give them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If put in their hands all power in the West Bank, not whether they begin to launch rockets toward Israel from there, as do their fellow in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">Better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise its head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, supporters of the “hard-line” will win; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">With that, the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority is domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the defense budget, Israel's more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism, Egypt's President Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In Israel, not less, must take account of the long-term consequences of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least the onset of democratic change in arab countries, the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that, sooner or later, will explode in the occupied territories, Israel, like автобусу взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the jewish state, and the demographic aspect-the growth of arab population-only exacerbate these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">The violent operations, which are taking place every few years on the territory of Gaza to Hamas, must pay the growing discontent of the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need external импульсе</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution, to which reiterated calls for the sane, representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">There remains the hope, not too big in the short term, in the hope that a cease-fire would allow other countries to effectively influence on the sides of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which has a long time to accept the decision to shut down the supply of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a good position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the jewish state, with the 1967 with land and a combination of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other arab countries must also make efforts toward reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more for the creation of a palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which can become a virtual recognition of palestinian statehood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to tap into solving the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia's entry into force of the law about унифицированной packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about smoking images of damage and struck down by illness, parts of the body контрастно stand out on green унылых коробках, identical for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in the world to practice the australian law однотипной packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replacing логотипы цветное and forging of different brands of equal коробкой bleak-olive color with dire snapshot hit by the disease of parts of the body and the images of the children's health, which undermined their smoking parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Aside from different pictures and надписей, warning of the damage smoking, the only difference between with buckets, introduced in обязательном order with this субботы - name brands, that same small напечатаны шрифтом.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most severe in the world conditions for formalizing упаковок tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Australia's federal government claims that the goal of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the вредную habit of fashion status.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the heart of the decision became the results of studies that demonstrate that people are starting to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100, never become курильщиками.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“It is clear that, even in the most юном age children understand the sense that tobacco companies are trying to communicate with the help of formalizing strips,” Health Minister поясняет таня Плиберсек, referring to research that performed that, for example, the crown in логотипе associated with children with the idea of Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the least in the world of smokers, so that these changes will not count on profits, multinational corporations, but the possibility of similar measures have already seen and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this will increase the share of the black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">“This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his start the,” believes Scott Макинтайр, a representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Budget manufacturers of products from China and Indonesia will provide far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, the new laws are conducive to the growth of the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Сандра ха from a small family company Zico Import Pty ltd argues that demand for портсигары and силиконовые футляры, скрывающие unpleasant images on the packaging, rapidly grew up (with almost zero), since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court in Australia, where tried to appeal the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to сандры ха Zico, the company has already implemented the order of six thousand products wholesale businesses and expects a new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among the very part of the population, which are aimed at these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After making a series of laws in Australia, make illegal tv advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers put cigarettes in plain sight, advertising tobacco products moved to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia's government has banned the local companies and Web sites to locate advertising in the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If you торгуете табачными изделиями and you have remained only this small лазейка, the idea of advance its product in the Internet you seem very temptation,” поясняет Беки grocery, исследующая questions of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Фримен marks a rise in the number of review on brands, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, such as social networks, like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this is a matter of rank-and-file citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes, not wished forces and time and made the broadcast, or is behind this рекламная company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The australian bottling British American Tobacco, argues that the industry is now more involved in adapting to the new rules, than an advertisement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules: these are the state's claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade has been unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all of these countries' trade relationship with Australia is quite small.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to the government, the collective Плиберсек обсуждало with other countries to take similar laws on their packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada has introduced the first proof of posting photos of warning about the damaging of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now, this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia had not obeyed improvements.</seg>
<seg id="32">These images of me not задевают.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply do not обращаю attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">“Simply выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь пачку in the pocket,” Viktor поясняет el Хейг, покупающий cigarettes with фотографией tumor ротовой полости on пачке.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, the only thing that can force me to give up-this is my small дочка.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Йу заведующий магазином tobacco products, King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same упаковка's complicated the task of positioning goods at полкам</seg>
<seg id="37">“Before I have the new party разгрузку уходил hour, and now four hours,” he complains.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Скучать electronic networks in the world and the permanent connections is not all bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this day of благодарения I suddenly had to be five hours at the airport, because our plane surfaced mechanical dislocations and replaced by another aircraft, which we and дожидались.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had plenty of time for reflection about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I would not fool you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Полдня at the airport in anticipation of рейса - it really bored, and there is not much help, no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even the shops беспошлинной trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But lately, more and more scientists and experts in childhood development is in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that, in certain situations, for us and for our children скучать is not all bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">This leads to an interesting brain distracted ancillary topics that may contribute to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because, in the modern world, we all are constantly facing what any screen, the benefits of boredom passed by us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Can be we need to strive to boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time there is.</seg>
<seg id="13">We are back to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before I, like many, believed that скука - invention about recent times, when people have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not so, argues Peter туи, a professor of Greek and Roman history, the canadian University of Calgary, author of the book “увлекательная history of boredom” (Boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In fact скука boasts very ancient history,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in Помпеях discovered latin calligraphy of boredom, датируемые first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It remains an open question about how we understand скуку.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, says John D. Иствуд, адъюнкт - University Professor at the University of York in Онтарио, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often изменялось.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Learning materials research on this topic and asked the question of targeting a group of 100 people, a professor of Иствуд and his colleagues came to the next definition: скука - this is when people “want, but can't do that, generating them satisfaction.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between скукой and apathy, he says, is that people скучающий not doing something that would want to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">Apathy with nothing to do not want.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the main переживаемой boredom, he says, it is a “violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time reaching slowly.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On described скука can seem very like a depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Иствуд argues that, despite the possible link between these состояниями скучающие, people see the reasons for the problems in the world and circumstances, and people undergoing a depression, see the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems that we bored when, in fact, we just find it difficult to concentrate on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study “Незанятый mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention”, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Иствуд with colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants who listened to a recording voice читающего magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud sounds, not as a matter of television programs, включенной in a neighboring room, others have heard these same sounds low громкости, so that they could barely break, and a third group only listened to a recording votes without звуковой pathways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard the tv with low громкости, noted that they were bored, more often than the other – it was difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to concentrate attention on the difficult task of attention, or a fascinating abnormality can cause скуку, says Mark J. Фенске адъюнкт, a professor at the University of the Neurosciences Institute Гвельфа, Онтарио, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do anything неинтересное, “for example, всматриваясь in the flow of products on конвейере in search of a marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It continues to it that when people start to покачиваться on a chair or paint каракули листе on paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such action is simply not help we relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“The study showed that children who do not prohibit ерзать and go round, learn more and запоминают more information than children, from which require смирно sit,” says Professor Фенске.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we all feel скуку: with delay рейса (as in my case), listening to the speech, scanning монотонную неинтересный film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But different people have different propensity to demonstrate the extent of boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980's to measure such individual features, the researchers have developed a special “metrics prone to boredom.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For the definitions of such a scale used questions and statements, for example, “a lot of what I have to do, and однообразно монотонно” or “me too much interesting, so the lack of time”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of these вопросников researchers have identified that boys missile more often than girls, says Steven Воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular with a variety of external раздражителей.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, teenagers in general often missile.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Mr. Рид Ларсон, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he связывался through пейджера with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they bored in school and during the implementation of household tasks, and 23% said that they bored outside school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">With only 3% of parents admitted that they bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Ларсон notes that it has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom, now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he knows that, in the age of “подростковый must peak prone to boredom,” mainly because children and teenagers are not permitted to fully address than they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back to my original question: скука useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations of it, as studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky азартным games or abusing certain chemicals in trying to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between скукой and творчеством, says Professor Воданович, examining this issue in more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">“So our brains suggests that we should do something else; it is скука,” says-Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the City University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But this is not always the most brain knows, it is better to tackle.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are bored and you направите this energy on the game on гитаре or кулинарные опыты, you will be making themselves better.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you would watch tv, you will be better off just in time, and soon it will pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if your child скучает and you give him the ipads, he stops скучать, but he will learn to grapple with скукой on its own or as any other way to manage their time and employment, says Professor Фенске.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">“And such skills of independent regulation задействуются in the different situations,” he argues.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only on their own to occupy themselves something, he is also studying самоконтролю at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that скуку need as the praise.</seg>
<seg id="56">But consider it a bad thing, too, should not be.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Иствуд agree with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">“We see this so that we need more experience скуку, with скука - this is very unwelcome, unquenchable desire to tackle something rational way,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In fact, people want something отключиться from constant concern and just relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">“In the modern world, we are used to the constant over-stimulating the senses, he says, and when there is a silence, we теряемся and did not know what to do.”</seg>

<seg id="1">While it is unclear how the new law will be applied to the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Ороско девятнадцатилетний soccer team player, and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado State accused of committing criminal offences, заключающегося that will soon be totally legitimately throughout the state: possession of a small dish of cannabis and the tube, in which he's smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Ороско says that one day in September, he was with friends in Ламаре and drove in car on прерии near the border with Канзасом, when police stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Ороско agenda came in court for drug possession and ownership of приспособлением for drug use, petty offenses, each of whom причитается fine of $100, and appointed by the date of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“We treated as criminals,” says Mr Ороско.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of the hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much on the law, how many seats from consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The charges in the small правонарушениях associated with molecular, already bets in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped file charges in people age 21 and older, for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks after the law takes effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in the more conservative constituencies Colorado prosecutors decided to consider the existing things associated with molecular, and still have a responsibility for the storage of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs Денвера mountain areas of the West to vote for it, to prevent the emergence of in their new places, shop staff лицензированных for the sale of cannabis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“All of this is evolving so rapidly, that I did not even know what the wait for further,” says Daniel J. Оутс, chief of police in the town аврора on East from Денвера.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of regulators in Washington State also озадачено почесывают heads.</seg>
<seg id="14">They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing growing, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis, and all of this needs to be done before 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most of the other states in the resolution of the issue of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, the first, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In Colorado, more than an orderly market, so they serve as a good example,” поясняет Bryan and. Smith, representative of the Council's regulation of production and marketing алкогольной products in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now, no one can do more, acknowledges Mr Smith, than to put some proposals and hope that this will work.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We have no real precedent, in which we could navigate,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington State, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and full year ввергнет staff in a state of uncertainty, when state licensing system is still there, and the ownership molecular already узаконено.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are, after all, still rocky technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find a balance between распоряжением state of “adequate access” to лицензированной cannabis with a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, game sites and child care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“It is especially difficult to locate лицензированные enterprises will trade molecular point in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” Ben поясняет Ливингстон, representative of the recently created by the research group “center of the legalization of marijuana.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November, chief of police of Оутс авроры sent out his underling e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract individuals entered age 21-year, for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stop уличать people in these violations “from this moment.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Police chief Оутс told me that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activity, выращивающих marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal traders and распространителей drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Prosecutor Уэлд counties in the north of Colorado, Ken, the LHC is a more rigorous approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to hold accountable for the ownership of molecular, mainly to prod its users-a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At this moment, the Eastern agents charged in storage and less than two ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“The duty of our institutions-hunted for actions that are considered criminal in their moment occurs,” said Mr. the tank in his statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was uncertain, even in places like rural district Меса, where participants vote rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The grand Джанкшн, the biggest city in the district, no longer has attracted совершеннолетних responsibility for possession of small quantities of drug.</seg>
<seg id="30">Prosecutor окружной пит Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided to not take charges on already open, associated with the storage of cannabis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“I believe that, to provide for the implementation of the law, as long as it does not change-our direct responsibility,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, принявших vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of cannabis for entertainment in public and legal system will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the confused reaction people in different places the state laid bare-digit relationship of local authorities to experiment with molecular state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">“The окружных prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier,” Sean поясняет Макалистер денверский, the lawyer representing the interests of those convicted for possession of cannabis, and the local representative of the National Organization of reforming the laws on cannabis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">“They sought for so long people for this, that now may not truly come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington — the first states, in which a small number of marijuana, about the same as for alcohol is destined to become an experimental fields in the country to test the idea of drug legalization.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they опаской waiting for instructions from with the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of cannabis as a federal crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Supporters of legalization of marijuana, the hope that the management of Justice cave in this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite a few received wide publicity arrests of traffickers and patients, употреблявших marijuana for medical depositions, the federal government in most cases gave good trade molecular for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and the 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Bureau agents to fight drug is unlikely to rush in homes, to seize a small пакетик marijuana, but they are likely to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of the state stores рекреационной marijuana, which allowed for the new law, believes Kevin A. Сабет, a former advisor to combat drugs in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores on the sale of cannabis, and so could not open up earlier than through the year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, Монтроуз city in the western part of the state, has proposed a six-month ban on trade in molecular, which appears to be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">“We do not want to be in this position, that we выдадим someone license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Николсон, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city has voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we have a clear contradiction between the results of the local vote, and voted for that state.</seg>

<seg id="4">My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world учебное establishment, the modern counterpart classical симпозиума закладывающий, the two foundations of civilization - свободомыслие and tolerance.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="5">And yet, two weeks later, dropping out on historic факультете Вустерского College Oxford in the late восьмидесятых, I gathered чемоданы and departed, which culminated in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>

<seg id="13">Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I for one reason only травили, and in that it was the cradle of прославленной просвещенности a barbaric and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Уайэтт, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was сторонницей conservatives.</seg>

<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, follows center-right views, is subject to the same травле.</seg>

<seg id="30">A year before, the University of voting have stripped the former студентку Margaret Thatcher her почетной extent due to budget cuts spending on higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere would be неуютно even сталинистам.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week первокурсника, when students знакомятся with each other and with the teachers, I experienced the first time that ждало ahead of me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I still do not know what teachers not only overlooked during the травлю students-conservatives, but also very happy to take part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues-the strike mineworkers, privatization and oppose the government to implement sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - проникали through обшитые wooden панелями Wall audience.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">“Miss Уайэтт, said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please, переведите first paragraph”.</seg>
<seg id="37">The text давался me with hard, I запиналась.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very желчным man's face, like a cake.</seg>

<seg id="43">I was back in his room is very sad.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the evening, in college, I sat for dinner one; then someone похлопал me on the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, a student with a second-rate of the english language, which is a member of the University Conservative Association.</seg>

<seg id="50">Most первокурсников - conservatives pretend that they labour”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local пабе, I tried to maintain a cowardly лицемерить.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that did not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The catch failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">Первокурсник of philosophy, politics, and economics, who himself studied in Итоне, said: “you are the daughter of fascist pigs.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contagious.”</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was flawed, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">“As conservatives have sex? asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> They колотят each other, the truth?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I feel so, as must have felt homosexuals to the removal of criminal prosecutions in шестидесятых.</seg>
<seg id="61">Whether I will ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or do I have to meet with minded only under cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">Whether I will be forced to become a Labor and hide their true beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years I have become seem адом, full of hardship and solitude.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Стоун, a professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">His hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was Thatcher's adviser on foreign policy, and one of its спичрайтеров.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he has not appeared.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for personal remoteness, pettiness, and commitment to Marxism - детерминистскому view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Билкент in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">“Here you are not will be happy,” he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I was touring in oxford from родительского at home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and friends непредвзятых metropolitan.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told the father that hate oxford and explained the reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">He believed me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in сороковые years there are any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">“But this is the best university in the world, he said жалобно.</seg>
<seg id="76"> Is there such a not able, not only in the city of frozen шпилей …</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends-communists always behaved perfectly.”</seg>
<seg id="78">His eyes влажные помутнели.</seg>
<seg id="79">“Not принимай поспешных decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that this is just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You разобьешь me heart, if бросишь university.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was constantly изнурена journeys in London and my emotional protection weakened.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a conservative, not weathered the pressure and abandoned his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">Next week, in time, when another teacher history very seriously called me “enemies of the people”, I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that “I промыли brains parents”, and called them “old дураками.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the lid firmly гроба my career in Oxford was to care of my father.</seg>

<seg id="1">The biggest profession in the world: miners with Кавах - Иджена</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The four euro indonesian miners risk their lives and health, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulphur in the volcano on steep каменистым тропам</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for whom their work-hell, and others are literally working in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them Анто Виджайя, one of 400 mineworkers who earn a living prey of sulphur in вулкане Кавах - Иджен, based in the east of the island's Ява.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day Анто спускается hit rock bottom, where кратера сернистый gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, застывает in contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Отколов huge sacks of sulphur, the total weight which could reach 70 kilograms, he puts them in two бамбуковые basket, will place a basket on the shoulders and carry them to the top on обрывистой mountainous road.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before the bar of the volcano, which is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам requires more than 40 minutes to climb черепашьим step, barely keeping the balance and carefully нащупывая path to not оступиться and not fall over the precipice.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that another large step could cost them life, as happened with one туристкой from France, which collapsed a few years ago with clear of the rocks Кавах - Иджена.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners with Кавах - Иджена earn 5 евроцентов for every kilogram of sulphur, which drill</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, they pave the path between the tourists that their фотографируют, as if they were обезьянами of circus and weary, carrying heavy basket, go three miles to the scales that горнодобывающая company расположила slightly above, rise to the occasion 1.850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is about пт Канди Нгримби, venture, which эксплуатирует since 1960 this volcano, and better and not say, their workers, which it pays 662 indonesian rupees (5 евроцентов) for every kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83) евроцентов нефтехимическим manufacturing, for this минерал distributed in everyday life and is used for production matches фейерверков, косметики динамита, and even for отбеливания sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">“So, as is the norm переноска 70 kilograms, we зарабатываем around 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every ходку,” поясняет we Анто, which usually carries out three daily переноски.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours to each of them and in the end feels разбитым, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems мизером нечеловеческого for such efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Поденная шахтерам price is very high on the local standards, where the collection of coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and среднемесячный earning two million rupees (167 euros),” разъясняет грузчик, who previously worked on каменщиком туристическом island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the station was not so severe, but Анто returned with his family in Баньюванги, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as massive as сера: “I'm marrying a young girl from Bali, where some индуисты, and he brought her on Яву to it adopted Islam.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Анто asthma, he breathes, constantly кашляет, and he слезятся eye due to toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years Анто spent three years, risking a Кавах - Иджене, which has already begun сера checked on him, despite the availability of masks and special eyeglasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes, constantly кашляет, and he слезятся eye because of the toxic gas, which emits a volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that he must pay for achieving their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Поработаю another two years, because they want to open a shop or learn spanish or french,” he promises to more than an acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Наказанный life, this comfortable and bright young people could be туристическим гидом официантом портье, or in the hotel room, but instead he performs work мула.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dividing the disreputable wooden hut with other носильщиками, he comes every day in the morning, two because сера not fading вытекать at night, when its signature желтый color is blue and блестит among мрака.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, Анто спускается in the crater, when covering the way small фонарем, подсоединенным to his каске, which he bought for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 носильщиков low basket with grey on their shoulders from the bottom of volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite the high profit margins, the company is not горнодобывающая механизировала mine sulphur for saving costs and provides no equipment носильщикам that work on their own account and with such deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they are not even part of the 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) for фотосъемку collection, which, along with a ticket for входным 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this заповедника взимают with tourists who come to сфотографировать volcano and its people - мулов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“This work for cattle, and not to the people,” says Бадрусин, коренастый носильщик 42 years, who spent on Кавах - Иджене three decades since the left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he assures that will endure the job “as long as can,” because he needs money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Not уйду retire, die here, because the volcano-this is all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although сера обжигает жжет's throat and eyes, when suddenly, the wind is changing and catches mineworkers in плотных столбах smoke, breaking from the volcano, they are so выносливы, that no one is complaining to their worst disease … more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with the wind, артрозы, pain, to its knees and on the shoulders of the pest, which деформировались under the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Балансируя basket on his back, Унайник now can only raise 50 kilos in 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his comrades takes 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three грузовика перевозят on storehouse in Тамансари, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on the narrow path among зарослей.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Not уйду retire, die here, because the volcano-it all my life,” says Унайник, is opening his mouth, which lacks a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">One of his five children, older, 30 years, also works переносчиком sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation of one of the severest of doing in the world: what do human mules with Кавах - Иджена.</seg>

<seg id="47">According to specialist, the most effective way to show that such privacy children and teenagers, is to ask questions that make them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">“Talk to them, to ensure that they do not do this, it is futile,” she adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Поррас contributes some options: there are things that you are not told незнакомцу, so why would you do it on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like those that you published a pro his friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Whether you know what others publish pro you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you подписываешь photos with вечеринок просишь, whether you are allowing other people to celebrate them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And another, everyone will need to know what you do in every moment?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to give them to understand that they should conduct themselves online as well, as do this оффлайн.</seg>
<seg id="55">The rules of one and the same.</seg>
<seg id="56">“Outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so as to be in social networks,” she says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="15">To assess the progress, should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today at an average annual rate of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality has fallen dramatically in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report ЮНЭЙДС), it is also true that, since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already recorded 187 deaths by May of this year; however, argues that although there are ubiquitous access to the drug since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Why, so far, is a lethal the outcomes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I am, so this is the case in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At a minimum, the past 12 years we have had no shortage of медикаментах, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about his инфицированном position, that is, in the later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He led сокрушительные data: “nine out of ten patients come when, already have some оппортунистическую infection; what needs to be done, to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so this is a diagnosis for more early-stage, and so we must provide fine for identification on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked to it.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal opined specialists and government officials of the Council on preventing AIDS in Халиско (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Фабрицио, who asked for the review in a private laboratory, побужденный only those that did his friend and, despite his young age, he has already been on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой Капоши, раковой tumor, which is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that will die, and don't want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Time is still die, the better I will be надираться three times a week,” they say. but not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I well питаюсь, do exercise, принимаю drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">“I work, I have a lot of class, I give a tour, an active life of gender, but with shared responsibility, забочусь about themselves and about another person,” listed Фабрицио, who agreed to share their personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to сподвигнуть his statement that those who now, in the context of the World Day to Fight AIDS, is experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, on this task, “actually increased distribution of condoms, before we make one or two, we will now offer packages to сотне, and this is a very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now so far has no access to презервативу”, he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to the new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“Why do they have?” is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, staff аптек and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured пропагандист.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose that the change is inefficient distribution; to condoms were not only for прилавками and to a hundred of them was in автоматах туалетах in public places, which often goes to the young.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not encouraging распущенности.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not about the payment, beer and мотеля, Governor Эмилио Гонсалес replied, when asked whether it is possible, the distribution of condoms under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">“It's not sexuality, best to make condoms available to those who are already testing sexual activity,” he said.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few in Puerto Rico, housed in the minds of so many баскетбольных stories, as “Гектор Хетин Рейес.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And even before the hemorrhaging in the brain environmental him to a wheelchair in 2008, Рейес was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small player categories, top player баскетбольной League, уполномоченного and chief BSN with Ковбоями Баямона and president of the Federation of basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“I carried out a lot of roles in баскетболе throughout his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president, BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990's,” recalls Рейес Primera Hora during a visit to his home in Баямон, where he lives with his wife founded Исабель, retaining for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Basketball was my life.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Рейес not exaggerates, making this claim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his home, almost all украшенные photos and памятными things, gathered for a long way, attest to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the heart of Баямон</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The emotion he protects those who remember his way through Ковбоев, starting in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when under 15 years of his speech in the role with the agent or agent of the contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“This was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Ковбоев since 1967, as an agent, with the agent or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I попрощался with one in 1981, the year дебюта Джерома Минси in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From that moment, and continue to lead a “Куко Ортис”, which was a great administrator,” noted Рейес.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that the genie бартов that направлялся here and was in the University Алабамы (Birmingham), told me: “I have for you, there is a very strong player, the growth of 6'7”.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Want?”</seg>
<seg id="17">And this was the beginning of a Минси, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico,.</seg>
<seg id="18">Бартов then recommended снайпера Raymond гаусса, who received the citizenship and became one of our best бомбардиров.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if Минси brought чемпионство Баямону гаусс, would have helped to win another one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Чемпионством Ковбоев with гауссом I насладился, but is already at a distance, because to the 1988 already значился boss of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Минси in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remember how we won for the first time in the US during the olympic квалификационного tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, on which we have received the fourth and it was to be bronze, if not the canadian judge, which has forced us to play the game, said Рейес.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team with the World Cup 1990-this is the best team, what you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that won the Team's Dream have in the Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the one with Панамериканских games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and разбили team of the US, which was quite similar to that which we have бронзу won the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the team not only again played Минси, гаусса, Рамона Риваса, Fico López and “Пикулина” (Ортиса), but also the young (Javier) “Тоньито” колон and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Франсиско and Edgar) and Mario “Quixote, Morales, who could not participate in 90 year because of the trauma of колена.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which, perhaps, was not the best in terms of personal composition, but has brought us the gold medal and great delight, was a team of Olympic квалификационного tournament in 1995 Неукене, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With ролевыми players such as “Канито” Ньевеса, Pablo Алисеа and young Роландо Хурруитнера players in return, temporarily estranged for confusion in the championship Панамериканском Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico,?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, this was Пикулин Ортис.</seg>
<seg id="32">His impressive performance in international tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico, not dominated at this level, as did Пикулин.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this is without taking into account his career in different leagues, in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best пуэрториканцем manager?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a very good молодняк, including Хулио Торо, флора Мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond Далмау, Армандито Islander people.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the young, I like to work Лео Ариллы.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What you think you his crowning achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in the Glorious era national team between 1988 and 1998, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What you have done?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to make, for example, регионализацию smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, to boys from Понсе played only in their area, and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national плей - офф.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now guys, travel and play too much, and it unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see the fruits of a compulsory certification and appreciation for managers, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">It delivers me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you do now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen music, watch music videos on YouTube, my era наслаждаюсь their grandchildren and occasionally хожу on баскетбольные matches.</seg>
