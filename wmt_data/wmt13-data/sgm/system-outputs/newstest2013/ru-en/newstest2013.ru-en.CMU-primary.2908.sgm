<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans justified its policy to fight fraud in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the Brennan Centre believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, the actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the Canadian American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, complicating the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only in a 2011 was 180 bills, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of the presence of American citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, the right to take away the right to vote and voter registration in the day of citizens who have a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections no American states do not require voters to present an identity card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first state, which has such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities to spread the practice and the other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years they initiated bills to voters to identity card with a photograph, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have a universal identity, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, 11% of US citizens, there are 21 million people under the age of necessary for voting, do not have identity card with a photograph, issued by the state government body them.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity often exceeds a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students-voters, who are believed to vote for the candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph issued their educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these states are members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to be used for voting certificates issued by the club.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state demanded evidence of the American citizenship for voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting from 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apparently, these measures aim to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, the Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws, the registration of voters on election day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This limitation is not passed without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to contribute to the list of about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall of 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latest accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened and come from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Presenting only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to the white, forming 76% of the voters, only 46% among voters ahead of schedule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose laws limiting the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">A few draft laws was vetoing governors Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most controversial laws was suspended with the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This allowed partly to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the charge of identity card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules came into effect, of course, hinder the implementation of the right to vote in the elections of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that were adopted, seeing in them the obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, the actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, tests on the dog Lenegativnie sometimes erroneous results, and sometimes Lgepositivnie that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men, and so are reluctant to the Dispanserizazi, there is doubt even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of the two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups, therefore the data is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the European found different levels of mortality for those patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who have not passed screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, I would recommend tests from 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men of African origin also are at increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cancer can be both aggressive and low-level.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient must explain the risks of his cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who have detected cancer, will not be held cancer treatment, because they are not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we will start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly we define the exact criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would still be tested.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass the test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of passing the test the dog.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (the English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is believed that if all people are good enough to eat and move, 30% of RACO could have been avoided.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one else smoked, the figure rose to at least 50%," says Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer are completely unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The public is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is a colossal damage to the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says a spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">The promising fact: Ten years after the rejection of smoking risk died of cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and colon, esophagus, pancreas and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protect against colon cancer," added the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is also necessary to avoid sausage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Canned meat drying or smoking by Sasol, could lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The past can harm cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists engaged in the study of the vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But at the moment the results of these studies is not a single.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the SCC, the study of vitamin E give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite results.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of Vitamin D also is not complete clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family is important to discuss with a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The analysis does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last summer, a message that scientists may be able to discover the Higgs boson, caused a real boom-and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that the boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, this is the latest particles, the existence of which was predicted in the Standard Model, our best, or in any case, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the conduct of the matter, but that has not been found experimentally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics is not until the end of are confident that the question is about the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without the shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a new particle and that it strongly reminiscent of the Higgs boson, predicted the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, the new data presented this week for a major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems to be confirmed, although the full confidence of some data still lacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to make a mistake appear to be minimal, and see what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is one law, in this world, the inevitable that the two things may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">To circumvent this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it is also one of the law of nature: the principle of Pauli, which postulates that the two particles could not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are one and the same "quantum state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the basis of this, the physics is shared by the two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find decent citizens, called Ferionami who sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In another hustle bosons, the vile gangs of anarchists who have no respect to that, at least to this principle, that means that they can be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website (by the way, quite extraordinary adventure Laboratory at Berkeley, the boson particle), in turn, divided into two groups: Meson, which we are here to talk about will not, "particles and forces," which are the main force of nature and that in some ways is the Higgs boson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These are the boson, it should be emphasized, not all exotic creatures such as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an incredibly banal boson: photons, or particles of light, "which is a" courier "electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when one particles with an electrical charge, accelerates or change direction, it "violates" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the stone in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "violations" of electromagnetic waves (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photon-and, therefore, one of the boson "vectors of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference is that in order to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the field of the Higgs is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his excited to achieve very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond, the surface that could unsettle only a very large stones.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why it is necessary to huge particle accelerator, as that is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN-a ring with a diameter of 27 km! "to achieve such huge energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for an explanation of the correlation between the Higgs boson and weight.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indeed, not all particles and not all the materials interact with electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, he never will be on the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles interact with a Higgs: those who interact are mass, while others (as a photon, by the way) it does not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what can bring all of these studies, "says Ms. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">They are used to validate the Standard Model (CM), and it also allows physicists find a divergence between the results of the observations and forecasts cm.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, some of them passionately thirsty to this divergence, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for a "new physics" and shut some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, it must be said, is still flawed, offering no explanation for the gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the Universe (ouch-ouch!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But so far at CERN such differences are not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person, it is more difficult to predict but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They envisioned their applications in science, but no more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory Bell, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he developed the first continuous laser pulse (previous) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition, there may be a tool for accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although it wasn't his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all the world's digital cameras and deserved the Nobel prize for physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, indeed, that everything can be.</seg>

<seg id="17">Regress to the status of a child for some unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It all depends on the ability of people to come to terms with the decline," he said.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms. A., 89 years, the most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has allowed me to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have a good children," she added.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask to facilitate breathing.</seg>

<seg id="29">This is the palliative care, which is when there is nothing you can do more.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to make the death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for every 11,700 people are one place in palliative care institutions.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.</seg>

<seg id="39">On the morning of his son swilled down this beer at the feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are helping relatives, as well as patients," says Nathalie Hussain, director of care.</seg>

<seg id="41">In the orphanage Victor-GABA no one day does not look like the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">A 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, situated on his pillow during a toast in his honor, tragically dies of a young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and Pereprobovai everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel concerned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The 53% of patients taken at the shelter Victor-GABA, come from at home and 47% of hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, is to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering of the patients, included in the final stage of their lives, whether in hospital or at home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-GABA and the society of palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This is a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of the law, legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, circulating a manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balurom Mantom and Dr. Bernard Lapantom and to testify about their disagreement with a similar initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Cristian Martel, the health care system of Quebec is not enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before will be allowed to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, "I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists till the last day to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she told me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death, thanks to the medical staff, for what they did not fulfill their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in the fight against the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Ali Monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of his life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient is asleep until his death, either from time to time or permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Impossible to pretend that we do not know more about these sufferings.</seg>
<seg id="63">More and more patients who are unable to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients suffering from the pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I want me to have euthanasia," it means, "I want to make it was easier for me."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec offers limited to 100 dollars donations to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "until we are not strictly limit the electoral expenses, the policy will be dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires a full reconstruction of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: "We cannot fall below; boldly into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Paris St Germain is not FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary range.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but could-and the new dimension of the Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The profits of the great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I is growing every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff also brought a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, everything happens very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I'm not getting.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the beginning, the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF Clerontene and to my parish in St. Etienne I always strode forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you will benefit from the competition, Carlo Ancelotti ...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new this summer not to play matches a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that such a player like me, wants to be on the level and laid to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He helps deputies, such as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position that I have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the master of?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti is the respect of all technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first league is not equal to him and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had with him was reassuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I away from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has also explains to me my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season Paris St Germain?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league leader Lyon took place for us.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is a Champions League: We spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take the return match in the one-eighth finals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether Paris St Germain became the first European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has a budget ...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major European club, Paris, it is necessary to win titles and the long-term positions.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financial Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we are ardently wish to win this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were to close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, it was frustrating, because we had everything to come to the finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think everything will be fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that the struggle for the title in the team, such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expected too much from Paris St Germain?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully ready for this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find criticized for that, of course, it's a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to implement the project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons fails to pass the one-eighth finals, although they also spent a huge amount of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the invested amount, we were on 15 points ahead of the winter break.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be a disdain for our opponents and to the French championship.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "wake up" this new Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how exciting the first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">In May, I hope that we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paris St Germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the tasks of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Well, if they say that there is a "Slatanozavisimost."</seg>
<seg id="72">This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of head.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to this and he proves that he is the first Star League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">The group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surround him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it is really only.</seg>
<seg id="78">This stimulates and others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How do you have the Euro-2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">Like a letdown.</seg>
<seg id="82">I ardently wished to participate in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me hitting a little playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there many things, and I came out stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I can play good qualifier matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I had hoped since my baptism the blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and should now behave exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first month of Didier Deschamps led by Blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They are effective for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in qualifying group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">He is a strict coach, he is with the players and inspires the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not like to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc reached its goal, he qualified us in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will blue in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">A good deserved a draw (1-1), pulled out on October 16 in Spain is at the heart of the match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given us the belief in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">To this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">About 200,000 operations had already registered with 15,000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites are Bitcoini for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course Bitcoina, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars, before returning to today by about ten dollars (courses indicated on the website of the bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report, published in October, the virtual currency interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes Bitoin as "the most successful virtual currency," to compete with the dollar or the euro "and" similar to the common currency. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to promote the video game that made during the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operation of exchange controls and the handling of any central authority.</seg>
<seg id="14">The network Bitoin all nodes are at the same time holders of accounting books, auditors, currency issuers, Poupatelimi and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How is this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each deal between the two users is really going on between the two electronic addresses, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information relating to this deal, signed by the electron, using the double key encryption system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that Bitcoini used in the transaction, there are in the public accounts book, sent to the entire network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">She passes through the decision of the mathematical tasks, sent to computers, the central bank decided that as temporary, gets the privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are talking about the phase hashing file, that is a transformation of a large file in the digital signature, a short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "are" a new transaction and add to her room, before hashed "all together."</seg>

<seg id="35">"The defect does not apply to the protocol," says Pierre NASA, which recently launched Paymium company payments real money using the network generated.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reported about the possibility of money laundering through these anonymous service.</seg>

<seg id="1">We have gone from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">What's next?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa province and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not only on the US.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US suffered mainly Afghan peasants, who are regarded as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban, consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was when the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to protect their traditions, the old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will behave more delicately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the hills of almond trees due to the French loans, was in order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, would not be attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Since the end of 2014, the invasion of the Taliban will not be in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood on account of the struggle between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of freedom, the return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid the price of these peasants, in which they surpassed Al-Qaeda, but the situation has not improved in our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have become speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants, returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even are not fought.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that was not of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as leave those who managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">Public schools in the cities, both boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world, and who look everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the moment the army.</seg>
<seg id="31">The authorities, who will be to her commander, will be legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">The old commanders, to lead the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial guards, who would not be subject to the central authorities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, the country, with strong local differences should be decentralized, modeled on Western countries to some extent, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want to foreign control, especially before the election, scheduled for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">The industry was not put back on its feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system renovated.</seg>
<seg id="37">All imported; nothing is made, except fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority given to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, the state control over the infrastructure would be needed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral resources.</seg>
<seg id="41">This has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were there, only to them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the energy for processing copper or iron ore on the spot, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, there is no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remains the biggest employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is also necessary to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The conclusions of the French combat units ended on November 20.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of the archaeological delegation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and follow the impossible task of assistance with offensive operations, "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, with a small French organization has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.</seg>
<seg id="48">These works, the intensive involvement of the local workforce, could help stem the uprising: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, the restoration of forests, fruit trees, the protection of soils and an increase in the area of arable land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What we will leave the memory of themselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?</seg>

<seg id="1">The birth of the constitution of Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is more than ever, on the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play in the bank.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text of the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago, the head of state provided the two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It has been two years, as Egypt is based on the preliminary text, who introduced several amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal contradiction.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," while "the word" and "violates the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians, the article for the article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent raging across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The more that the call for accelerated voting like the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you to vote for my, or I leave a emergency powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of liberals are not responded to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to get his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements arose around ... time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were not properly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday was vote, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, stipulates that "sharia principles are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would enable them more strict application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For 2009, the fact that this article had not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"hypocrisy," meet the liberals, who see in this a PR.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, according to them, the Islamization of the constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University advisory role, particularly in the verification of compliance with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is worrisome, because "people to decide, not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy."</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the emergence of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, many liberals, excited by the fact that the next president of the university, it seems to be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, "is not the Ulema, and people with a university education, some training in the French system" reassures Alexis blah, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he admits that "around the article 220 may be ambiguity, as used in her terms from religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to the "Fiqh" [the Islamic jurisprudence, - prim Ed].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges are competent to decide about this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to its religious aspect, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they were significantly reduced compared to what under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another moot point: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held in parliament, and the National Council of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also will not be denied the trial of civilians before military courts, despite the requests of the association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious consequences for the freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles are no longer talking about the protection of women, the BA Mora, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television, manifestations are scheduled today in the second half of the day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The great and powerful" to Moscow oranges: migrants hoarding money on language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">So far, deputies and human rights activists argue that the law of compulsory language testing, the country has already appeared fraudsters selling "fake" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come to 13 million workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the most part of this citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only aim is to earn money to support the families, remaining at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law entered into force on December 1, according to which each migrant workers must be exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and communal services, and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eventually, however, the promise of the FMS, the tests will be obligatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dealer will not only the language, but the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to, and to extend work permits.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Do not conform to the law and people managed to get the certificates and diplomas on the creation of before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, doomed and the protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language name of Pushkin, the Peoples' Friendship University, University College and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tests migrants will be able to all cities; now opened more than 160 such centers in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative of testing supported and deputies of the State Duma, and the FMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had asked many times in the press the question: what it is, in fact, this?</seg>
<seg id="18">That will change to knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all to meet the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representation of the FMS in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should start before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only 90% of the organized recruitment system will allow to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems appear for migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, I am sure Sebelev, the future of migrants is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of aid "for" putting him in a close Barak, where he and dozens like him will be months languishing without food and documents, induced by 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"At home they promise one thing, but by the arrival of their passport, select, not to pay promised salaries," confirms the head of the management of labour migration Ms Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not swear, Nasalinika!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, are going to work in Russia, acknowledged that not only do not know the language of the country, which seek, but also to write on their own.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not their fault, how much trouble: the few Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmen can afford to get even a primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even their families have nothing to feed the children, not to mention to them to wear, shoes and school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Dorast adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and crippled."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in respect of the law on human rights defenders say one important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test will be held only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the status is not there will be no exam, a subsequent official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of workers continued to live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome to, or to Pravda."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the newcomers argue that received the official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is bureaucratic and all the same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization of money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is false registration can be done quickly and for just 1,500.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Ask for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizens of Tajikistan Umed Hukadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Gubarev, do not buy the painting."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that there are not only false migrant registration documents.</seg>
<seg id="47">A "sham" certificates of the language tests already seized by the FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">The fake paper printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping thus to facilitate the task of the tests, paid for the documents of the seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: It will cost three thousand labor migrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the main task of the soon-to protect the system from corruption, "peels" it was impossible to simply buy, and representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">Meanwhile, the government may have promised to guest workers, failed to successfully tested the first time, the time to study the basic language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, the visitors who do not know Russian, will be offered work in the areas, not that active communication with people.</seg>

<seg id="33">The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and service, the literature and open data portals on arms issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Half of the weapons on the black market was caused by the officials, whose work is connected to the weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons from places of armed conflict, 14% of cases are theft at the stage of weapons production, 5% of the "black archaeology."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The seller-consultant of one of the weapons shops, who asked not to call his surname, pledging that the guns, the black digger, has not been buying too old for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often than not, as he says, the new party sellers go to the military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ensign person buys unit, for example, the gun volumes.</seg>
<seg id="40">He discharged her pass through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"He carries it in the city and possible to sell 900 euros per with two shops," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"However, the police in the course of all cases, therefore periodically when Burns plans for crimes, the purchase of traders have illegal weapons," adds a consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in the luxurious shop."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I did not respond sites, blogs, while comrade, who proposed to arrive at the platform "racing," where will the man who took me in the corner, "where we are."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military commentator Viktor Barantsev</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I need to get the barrel familiar, with an exit, "says the seller consultant." I have so familiar, but I'm not sure it.</seg>
<seg id="49">Sellers in the markets, but there also needs to come conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter had a tooth out."</seg>
<seg id="50">I now even a couple of Castetov out through the person, in which I am sure.</seg>
<seg id="51">He also their supplies only to me, because I know that I do not pass it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military Victor Barantsev has dabbled in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about this.</seg>
<seg id="54">The scheme, according to him, have not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He was given an album with photographs, where "anything."</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in the luxurious shop," recalls the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, according to Barantsev, does not offer a pig in a poke-all you can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, the potential clients, not just buy-we go with the seller in the forest, there is a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I give the opportunity to shoot, convinced that the weapons beats a good start to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">The shop on the couch</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Internet search engines are on the sites and groups in VKontakte, where offer to buy weapons for different purposes. "</seg>

<p>
<seg id="62">This does not need any documents and personal meetings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," wrote in the advertising cap on the site "to buy the pistol or machine."</seg>

<seg id="73">The buyer through an ATM payment.</seg>
<seg id="74">"In response to send a photo and instruction, where the hidden weapons," says a spokesman for the public organization "right to bear arms" Dmitry Kislov.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave in the ninth wave or she is destined to become obsolete in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Shares support the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the modest wage increases that are ordinary workers Walmart and the system of fast food, the purpose of the protests is to create a trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far this sector of the economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The 46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The campaign began last week, after a day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, the millions of street and sometimes accompanied a scuffle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day of some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which around the world employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops of the Corporation, who is on a modest and middle-income people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">So many low-wage workers Walmart come only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability of Walmart and the range of goods made one of the largest corporations in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell-off, partly because few pays its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain about the heavy conditions, for example, the lack of trucks or handheld scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance, provided by the Corporation, spiking from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical worker Walmart, receive 9.5 dollars per hour, these costs cannot afford, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will Srednuu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost of 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely to wage growth on the shoulders of the buyers, every visit to the shop will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year they will spend some 12.39 dollars; more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Proponents of Walmart a note that the protests occurred just nine states and the Corporation neither Maleaschego damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" continued on Thursday in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day, and during this time of Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its cash machines produced in "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the Corporation Dan Fogelman argued in an interview left the site, the Huffington Post that Jobs left a total of "less than five" employees Walmart, and that the protest was just a "next-trick organized by her union."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"A free society!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, where their unit were not stores Walmart (in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no them here), McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even gives you sick and does not pay for honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumein Williams, a member of the Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7,25 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast-food restaurants with its increase, but not much time, and an average of their ordinary workers are in New York at 8.90 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one earns less them in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can exist in New York on such money for me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through McDonald's was almost a quarter of American teenagers who earned their largesse after school, living in this case the parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw in the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I constantly in an interview with McDonald's, who complain that must live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal hangs comments, whose author notes that the irresponsible childrearing, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protest, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the fast-food cashiers and the chef system began to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, there are more than doubled their current minimum wages.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that were created in the field of fast food trade union organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits administration to prevent and punish the activists of the trade union movement hindrances and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely makes his life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the union of fast food, it is difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main is extraordinary turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The holdouts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day meeting near the McDonald's near Times Square, where several local politicians were Democrats, in particular, the members of the council Jumein Williams, said: "McDonald's" says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even gives you sick and does not pay for honest work. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the candidate for the post of mayor of the City, Bill de Blasio, said that "we must all engage in support of the fast-food workers so that they have fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every New Yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">How to characterize the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food sectors.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which tens of thousands of people in New York are busy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether this will spark the flames of the mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Until the cheat the brain is medium."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technologies of augmented reality in recent years has seen mostly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the relevant patent application filed and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Aramom Sadi, it follows that the scientists of the company points-history.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beckons the prospect of a manipulation of the virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Tell them, in general, what is your team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are human interaction with machines, but at the same time try to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the great majority of humanity stuck at the stage of working with the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking his finger in them.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, Xbox Kinect and sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without the Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting Gestove management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"What is still waiting for us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Despite the fact that Kinect suffered a interaction on a physical level, many still occurs on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of the information improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very much.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change it, working on a three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including the projective.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">First and foremost to draw these stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"What do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular pieces, but don't overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It certainly is not a panacea, the question arises of privacy, because they don't always want to notify the others of his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, the management of the devices in public places we thought we had a project in which over a gesture, but not over, and over such a reputation for being parsimonious short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not a camera, a wrist bracelet that registered movement of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While he's a big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general the future for the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"This is how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"For example, how do you ask me to give you that the Bank of?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"You want to force the users to adapt to what may or may not be at the moment the car?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"do not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow more precisely determine the reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution on depth, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"If you're talking about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have claims to the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There are not enough permission, the depth or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"In principle the current generation is that you can start in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 to/from.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not in the megapixels, and the quality and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">The latest point of view of all the current technologies are not good enough for us is adds to the work of designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y and Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The man is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to/from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betses of our Redmondsko laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable processing-from 1 to 100 milliseconds of latency, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60).</seg>
<seg id="46">Do not understand how it affects the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not a touch to FPS was great.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And the number of cameras increases do not need?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">In the Kinect now there are three cameras, one of which is actually-IR radiators, and the second receiver reflected a signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And now the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor the visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or aggravate it, increasing the required amount of payments.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect counterpart, play with the curvature of cameras and see how this will help in the 3D definition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their points.</seg>
<seg id="56">You do not think that from the point of view of the use of augmented reality goggles is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Of course, all the time around, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but that's what I think: the steep option would be a" rolling "augmented reality when, on the basis of cloud platform you could switch from points on the smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points is a very personal device in the their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time the weakness is a reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects with others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony Stark of" iron man ", but a simple mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, which often indicate critics such ideas: there is no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">The arms did not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lectures, I often say that a reality is the seventh such a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, the eighth may well be supplements of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, one of the most interesting trick-Use of second hand as a background for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is a pressing!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there is a technology that is aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" tactile feedback, for example, interference several of ultrasound beams at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but it is a very weak as if you blew on the pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers is also promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">"And you try to cheat the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"This is a good idea, we have not yet tried to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another challenge, which will have to fight for a long time is how to make the person, physically located in the very limited to believe that he is open, almost infinite-work and the concept of cross-country tracks (not moving platforms, such as the Club), as well as the huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">While cheat the brain is medium, work is still very for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes the work on a virtual reality research is attractive for many things in its infancy.</seg>

<seg id="42">But the clown all, the tragedy is smeared.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the rescue of the world by the totalitarian changing in Pricasnom order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now, the clothes are guided by foreign mechanics, rather than on the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, perhaps, his hand and who are not in a spat.</seg>
<seg id="47">And deception will be filmed with the help of changing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Recently we saw you in the role of his city. - The Cultural City should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, like me, they will be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">"Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">The disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier, the people pressed in the pack, Bohemians is loved, the other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all crashed on Microsoobschestva, it is hard to enjoy it all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a piece of paper to all.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now we need to think who will be like.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now each of the cult hero of 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"And the Stas Mihaylov comes on several thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It come Brosenki, Seks-social sphere is there.</seg>
<seg id="60">The cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, the less management, money, everything dies.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive, do not spoil their.</seg>
<seg id="62">I as a young man wrote such pictures that one collector they were hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the paintings, which usually finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: "The culture of spiritual culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of consumption, it is from other opera.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, grew by examples of the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused to money for the sake of drawing paintings.</seg>
<seg id="68">I'm for such a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">"Kirill, lacking Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a notion: Officials from the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not every one of them can be engaged in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under the right of all is not so it was, the Kings, could not really understood in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have in St. Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are closed, as are higher experts who will appreciate these experts and give them the right way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now thrives Vkusovishinka.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but what distinguishes them is that they honestly say that not all the modern art we accept, there are artists who should seek to other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">"What is for you-St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more there is soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our stones art is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil, and we writers now have more than readers, it is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are a lot of people who go to exhibitions, concerts, curious.</seg>
<seg id="83">We have this layer of signals.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make a fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="5">In order to save mankind, the question arises, how to continue of its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is small.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, only two of the planet that it is possible to at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's Venus and Mars," said a senior researcher at the state K. Sternberg Astronomical Institute (GAI) Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if the conditions more suitable for life on Mars, the so-called surface of Venus temperatures of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can live only at high altitude or the orbit of Venus ... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with Flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Half a century ago conducted experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the orbit of insects, the tiny fruit flies-fruit fly.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, the space sent eggs quails to check, as the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get the exit is absolutely normal chicks.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then the problem.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem with the fact that the chicks should find support, he should stand on its feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sycheva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding support, the chicks are tumbling.</seg>
<seg id="20">After 10 hours in newborns was full atrophy of instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks not to react to light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And then there was the trouble is that, after four days they just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"and twice we Viluplali chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible there to work with them," the failure of an experiment with birds in space Vladimir Sycheva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time the law biological "Minikoveg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the Biosputike "Bion" will only same-sex species.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Experiments with rats, who was sent into space since the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there was nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's just was Biosputnika, but again it is a unique experiment, and such research must be carried out," says Vladimir Sycheva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing of the space rats have offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">But to approach the problem of breeding directly in space until it.</seg>
<seg id="32">No easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals, losing, the usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.</seg>
<seg id="34">The man, unlike Swerusek, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create consistent emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons such experiments are not conducted.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the women in space travel for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was Tereshkova's.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious thing that have humanity, is a female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Chaika flew, and nobody on earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Will it be able to give birth to a child after the flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It's a question that nobody answered," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitsky, twice the orbit and even to work in space, was born the son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have little units are cosmonauts, who have after a long flight all cost, and is a healthy generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if more, then it is dangerous even the orbital flights," concludes a cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, mankind to look for any new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Girolaboratoria the CPC is a stage of preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work skills in space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If the adult water, and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants-native elements.</seg>
<seg id="54">The small Itiandry if confirmed, the life on land came out of the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is approximately nine months mother in Okoplonoy fluid, then it is easier to get to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing is just two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It is a very little to something," says instructor Grudnikovogo swimming Marina Aksyonova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, if a child of weightlessness more than the natural state, for women is the necessary gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Very quickly in weightlessness the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">Okay, lowered and it is relying on stimulants of activities.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, in a special cell to go on the list, pushed it.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then what?" asks a trivial questions Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Feeling of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn orbit is impossible, as an adult, dressed in a special load suit for training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">He will simply be deprived of what would be vital.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment, we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we bring to the ground a fully Desadaptirovannogo person," the head of the committee on bioethics YBP Ras Igor pest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">While the birth of children in space is a matter of the theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, the time it will be a reality when the Earth on their ships to the faraway planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the security audit department: checking Schwartz system failed due to the fault of the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of government procurement and the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the supreme security audit management, of an interview for the site Aktuálně.Cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, that, in my opinion, we do not have," commented the current situation Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German regulators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices are Petr Necas's approach to the so-called Schwarz-system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The prime minister recently said that the Civic Democratic Party (FOC) will not disturb the entrepreneurs check-out it is forbidden or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be in any way, and if he does something, the prime minister could not resist the work of the institutions that required to check and to achieve the commitments," concludes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which was the procurement laws of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The meaning is the test that we started, probably two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, the question that the European legislation claims, how should the government procurement, the national legislation and then also in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The information was collected, and even the still unfinished, revealed some interesting differences is to put it simply, we may have "the exact legislation and unmistakable," but in practice we on some parameters to Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And as the project can help you, what does it mean to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the laws, the reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to positive results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means to obtain the appropriate things for a reasonable price (but not always low) to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is not the fact that we achieve this by reducing the restriction orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps this system fulness "papers," so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restrictions had not declined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the internal problems of the practical application of the law on government procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">And as a system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there such organizations as our Kru (security audit management) or is it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the institutions, there is the quality of our Kru the Bundesrechnungshof, arranged by our principle, there is also a board, which operates a little differently, but mostly both institutions are similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the powers are similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of the audit and at the federal level in this way their system is different from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can manage only federal money, we have a state means.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the Bundesrechnungshof level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local legislation, there is much easier than us?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Indeed, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take for example, but you cannot say definitely that it is all better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is so, because they are better able to manage control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, I repeat, I don't like this kind of comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even a model country faced many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not receive any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If we are talking about the domestic legislation, as reflected on your institution amendments to the law on government procurement, somehow are the consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it was still not in our efforts to control.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We take this into consideration only in the process of future inspections, we have started to use our new tool "risk Neconomnosti detection," through which we are almost 14,000 government contracts. we analyzed them. there is, of course, these changes will be, because they are a-changin restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or additional strain on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope, it is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that may arise, "the rule is that" it will be impossible to observe.</seg>
<seg id="40">The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with supplier (for example, the regional operational program with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in such a case to tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I don't think that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake does not affect the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And while out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us realize that the path will lead nowhere. "</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister recently said that the FOC will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"Schwartz system" is prohibited or permitted? "</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be in any way, and if he does something, the prime minister could not resist the work of the bodies, which is obligated to check and to seek commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">One can say: "We have to change the law and allow it," but this is not to say that we pretend that nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The government procurement law contains very strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that protects public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of the formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, in my opinion, we do not have.</seg>

<seg id="27">School teachers regularly students of the Institute of Elicki and with them fun and interesting activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the additional construction of the Institute of Elicki in the future there will be a separate building, in which we move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At every concert will be a musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What were the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to create a program that will attract all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Barth, the tap tap, Marjan Bangguo and Jiri dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you plan any such "grandiose event" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For the first time in May was speaking at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next year, we would gladly have a representation of the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with expensive from the point of view of organization and logistics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants on electric wheelchair, the stroller should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, so far to deal with it without problems. The Czech Airlines Čsa and British Airlines and British Airways have always been great for us prepared, I was surprised how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to travel abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward the handicapped and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have to date?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is better than we have in Russia, we have seen that the east is still at the basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague in Moscow is very many barriers, and here is still in the new independent movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there is not a banal things, such as give way to a person in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are organizations that are trying to draw the attention of people to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And that, on the contrary, we constantly to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things, the level of which far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation, always depends on the efforts of those people who is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disability move on the streets, can go to the toilet, the museum, yes anywhere ...</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in public life, in the US with the tap tap a little ahead of them!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or Besbariernost is one thing, but at the moment when we are well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really began to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far this individual cases of people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">A group of the tap tap at the moment is very popular, but go back two years ago that in 1998, you made it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the Institute of Elicki as educators around me there was a lot of young people who wanted to do something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And because I am a musician and play including the saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, over time, as our leading LA Angels, says it is a little bit out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity came only in recent years, something confused?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, it helped us that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, essentially as if he does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the means of the European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was well in front of you to turn the tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business is full of things to imitate one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all the new is accepted with caution, and lasts for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, it is natural ...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not to suffer and all abandoned personalities, which we must regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live a full life and developing, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities something it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Whether the success of what you are, what do you think?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the job properly, we should be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that it is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they should know that twice a week to go to the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose the enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it is in any group that wants to work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the group of the tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them was at the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one LA Angels.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are open, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. on Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium in the club Fléda-Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava-in the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former eastern bloc countries after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the way to space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights in space, but it is not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to remind you, for example, on December 6, 1933, lectures A. Sternfelda who represented in Warsaw the astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "introduction to the space."</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, France Sternfeld won Robert Hesnault Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch prize for the "introduction to the space."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Yang Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote several books devoted to this scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became known to the world Cosmonautics propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway inspection, equipped with rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear even for acceleration or braking trolley was supposed to be used for missiles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information about this Dresine known only from the press of the era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about an Arrow missile.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study section of weapons in cooperation with the professors Mecislavo Volfe and Gustav Mogickim.</seg>
<seg id="18">The remaining materials shows that the study reached the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of German troops works were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the specialized press the idea of photovoltaic fighter missiles that offered engineers Rogozinski, and the next year to work "air missiles, torpedoes and air rocket-bomb author Lelivi-Kivoblockogo."</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war all projects the military use of missile technology was temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the job.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of his work ended because of the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The scientific work, dedicated to space, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 "problems" magazine, which published four-dimensional articles on astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">One of them professor M. Saturday suggested organized society, which will be engaged in space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (of) to join the international federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of her member.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the next year, the first chairman of Kazimierz Sarankevic (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">On this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, of a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missiles, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 M, was about 80 cm in length, and its weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently, the improved version of the RM-1, and was built in the summer of 1959 at Bledovsko wasteland were testing two-stage rocket RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was about 1.4 metres in length, and its weight is about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the rocket was able to do this scientific work-rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was overseeing tall wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, the further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The heir to the first missiles RM became a meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as two, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are three types of (identified as a meteor-1, -1C and -1C) that the size of the camera for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The meteor-1 missile has a space of 0.4 L, meteor-and meteor-1s, 1B-0.34 L-0, 62l.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 in aircraft Institute was the development of the missile Meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor-2 missiles with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring useful cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built versions of the meteor-2N and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee of the COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland, participated in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second Interosmonavtom after Vladimir Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision has provoked a lively debate in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, it will be interesting to look at this problem from a broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is connected with the principle of free trade and free, not restricted the movement of private capital with untamed financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor force (wage) is the price of tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept should understand the condition of the producer through the delivery of cheap goods to persevere in economic competition that "is" the cost of rival to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their income.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale, the means for the majority of entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, either cheap purchases abroad or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in the countries where the cost of the labor force, compared to other high.</seg>
<seg id="11">The private capital assumes no social responsibility, including and made them unemployment, are the inevitable government spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation strengthens the unwillingness of the Masters entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social damage done in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known, that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Cavalier methods of private capital to create at the level of the economies of individual states where governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital to the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government give its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This reflected primarily in the changes of the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to economically force its people to obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany for several years there is a public distribution of products to the poor, who are not in a position to feed their own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people is already approaching one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy are constantly cases when employed people such a salary, states that they must pay to get the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same as in which people are under pressure from the catastrophic fall or social status, forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or there is a poverty-level wages on the outskirts of society, in the hope that private investment capital will come sometime in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the question is, where he will?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty moved from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans still works for a share of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of their own, that managed the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not manage actions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">The following answer the question is not whether the private capital, now almost managing policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result we have unrelieved situation of corruption, providing mutual benefits, the law, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Ministry for a lack of financial resources to the development of the private legal firms that are closely related to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills claims the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, as the western-style constitution, and the financially-powerful groups, for their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy in such a situation as it is now quickly described Appiano in the work, "the crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has been disintegrating and institutions are engaged in the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bribes, illegal to obtain favours with stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls to elect a pre-sold voice "... decent people did not run for office of the state in the end, once for the eight months left without the consul" .. .. "seriously started talking about is that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for a vigorous man .. Appianus thought that it would be" Pompeii, but it was Caesar, who has replaced the democracy on the autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, the modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital has already in essence is not intended for use in the public order.</seg>
<seg id="42">The current result is not different from the past: the unprecedented decline in the elite without any efforts to reform a deeper.</seg>
<seg id="43">It means that the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should seek the reckless liberalization of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a Liberal-style democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is particularly tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are seeing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition on both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus the trend is a systematic character.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="23">The method, with the help of a working group of the richest families headed by Rothschild, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao-order out of chaos.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by killing the Hapsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, inaugurating the Bolshevik Revolucii.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war ended in a sudden, forlorn warrior and economically surrender of Germany (there was no longer necessary war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the separation of central European powers, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the launching of the second world war for bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation imposed on Germany, the huge war reparations that created the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then just had tossed the Germans a strong enough, denouncing the perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, of inciting the fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds provoked by the Zionist movement, one of whom sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour declaration to create the conditions for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler himself from chains in which it initially held bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations on the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed in order to create a war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers manage it unleashed, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people at the supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers Podsovivat people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascist Hawks, loyal international bankers politician, do everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) will be threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, a 20% of all the world's oil supplies (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as to lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In the light now are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and the people of the new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their view is the World masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, enjoy the comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world where everyone was born body at birth implanted a chip, with whom he is under total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand or forehead on the stigma, so that the people who are not marked the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is the wisdom: every person who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="44">For his name to the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film "Argo: When worse nowhere, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students, the demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who was the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation is not expected she could not afford to throw Shah overboard, because it is at the root of could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, the election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, Sregessirovannia actor Ben Affleck "Argo describes one of the episodes of the history of America, which brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the embassy of six workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the complex twists they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, helped extravagant legends cover, according to which they rode on a Canadian passport as members of the crew, looking for a place to shoot a science-fiction epic in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the "evacuation" of Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The legend was reliable, in specialized magazines was about the film project, organized a press conference, the fictional manufacturing company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film is based on memoirs of Tony Mendes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Affleck is a special combination of genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "- Kinoops film, the story of a successful enterprise, fraud-example could be a number of films about the friend's 11.</seg>
<seg id="20">The film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes of Tehran (credits shows significant historical photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film "the big differences in this is not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the light Hollywood fragments, the irony and moderate exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies are men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating table, the stairways institutions, on the phone ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck is managed to make resets career.</seg>
<seg id="24">The ridicule of actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Argo his third feature film after dark detective" Gone Baby Gone "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it was the first movie directed by Affleck, who is not in the hometown of Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of atmosphere place when this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck is in an "Argo," where Tehran "plays Canada."</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the movie are on the streets, the reconstruction of real events-the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy of impressive its clarity, which also transmits the emotions of confusion and unpredictable that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are scenes of fictional (fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">There are too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply a number of exciting cinematic scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">He is quite successfully works with a little, sometimes there is something to imagine it is not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America to prevent the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the rush on the runway look pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The disadvantage of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the necessity to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues is really very charming, but their characters deserved more space, and they are not only in the film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film, Affleck lacks a little dramatic, the movie is that you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style, the thriller Seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it takes hard.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, it is enough for a reminder of the one still live in a sense of history, as well as for evidence as exaggerated notions of omnipotent and omniscient services.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules of the balloons, bananas and the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com every year, the survey of the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd decision or project of the workshop of the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"We are journalists to this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of the large European companies," said "law" the organizers of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the already nominated by the nomination the absurdity of the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far, the women had benefits on life insurance, the insurance companies they objectively are less at risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Further ideas from the shop, the EU people can nominate the contest before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The voting will take place before the end of February 2013, "Nager said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial orders of the EU, for example, and compulsory adding bio-fuel that as a result of the harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or directive about the size of cages for hens, resulting in significantly tightened eggs this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "Buterbrodne butter" or from the sale of traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The high-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veto is the requirements of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union must reach 14 cm long and did not dare to exercise "abnormal curvature."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only the existing piecemeal national rules, which made trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, yet softened standards of fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directive would lead to Rastoceni products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate to win in the survey and last year's ruling of the EU, according to which sold balloons should be a warning that children under the age of eight years can't inflate them without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU appealed to the American Research, in accordance with balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, which prohibited blowing a fair Dudeli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Funny ideas are born and at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The absurd is and regulations regarding the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, using the name of Macedonia, and should instead "FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez-faire), suggested for the voting, in addition to several above these absurd rules, for example, the rules of the EU about the amount of food in the membership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently, the Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for what she faced a fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The questionnaire also interested in and ideas to pay some countries for what they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies on allegations of receiving subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">The European Union will ask about compensation, "said in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslaw Palace (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument, he pointed out that the country was high grain yield, and as a result, the so-called intervention buying state had full warehouses of stocks, which had to be removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a result, the European Commission went into the Czech Republic, a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for subsidies offered villages of the ministry of regional development, the minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies must go to the compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU: the bizarre orders are an exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the regulations in the member states easily become an object of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A serious problem, according to experts, is Erpanie subsidies of the EU projects that do not have even a hint that something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have been discussing the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is the emotions among Czechs and the fact that as in other countries of the European Union in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomouc curds," but "Tusemsky Roma, whose traditions in our country has its roots in the 19th century, our manufacturers must have been renamed the" tuzemak. "</seg>
<seg id="36">Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, instead of sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The EU's official list of registered products, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "Parma Ham or Gorgonzola," Maripanom from a German Luebeck, have already been dried, for example, Karlovy Vary, Pogorgelicky and Treboniskiy carp and Saaz hops.</seg>
<seg id="38">A trademark of the EU can also be proud of Pardubice carrot and Gorickie tubes.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want me to spare the republic, but I am an amateur, "Okamura said.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. senator, as a man who comes to mind to run for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't think about how to become a senator or the president himself.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we had all functioned without problems in the country, then I would not stand.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't see how countries stolen over the last 20 years, as people here tend the thieves, raise taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I have had no ambitions to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I don't like to try to find a solution how to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was 40 years old and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, except for the post of senator or the president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, you are, but soon went to the presidential palace.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you turn thus back to the people that you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I said that all the time to get involved in the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can make their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I have the greatest influence and a wide range of powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not just that we as a nation to grumble at the bar or TV, but at the same time are ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">This added to the media that the person who confuse the freedom of speech and vilify the freedom of lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, they told me that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Get to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the idea of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the inverse property declarations on the amount above 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To accomplish this, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You as a president of such powers is not, and only a the Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbying to conduct tours of free enterprise, it was advanced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politicking is when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and discourages citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent non-partisan person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I have no party Rascladivania in good order, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and to apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The Czech point of view, it seems to me that my people are more likely to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is not important for me is a little to the left or slightly to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important for us to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">The question is not that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always support any good for society, it will offer the Hrcm or the FOC, and I'm just going against a bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You get angry when someone says that you populists.</seg>
<seg id="34">But do you prove that you say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for the company, please feel free ideal targets and views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you are trying to get closer to it.</seg>
<seg id="37">Call this populism, but all the proposals, I'm talking about, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament you will remain just a slogan.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with this in politics, you will not last long.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you go to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement a criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to politicians, journalists and the public and trying to entice them on their side, so that we have achieved.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to organize direct television broadcast, in which I refer to the chairman of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And in case of refusal, they will be told why it does not want to.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong person who voiced the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president is the merit of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I speak directly, that I'm a fan, and not a genius and not intellectuals.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I am just a beginner in politics, and for its program to try to get the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it does not succeed, six years to finish and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is partly sounds as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one I do nothing, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Raimu Nure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">At least I also supported a leading investigative journalist Yang Lorenov that revealed fraud with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I put forward his candidacy because people were dissatisfied with, but now I feel the weight.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went to chose the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are independent in the Senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the basis of their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential supporters, and I do not have the money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money and the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about the property declarations, and how is your own affairs with it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a plot in Prague apartments worth approximately 25 million, 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by approximately 10 million, Aston Martin at 3.5 million and the Skoda Superb million, and a few million.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin I have appeared, because it was my first dream is that I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You on Aston-Martin, own property 60 million and you do not have the money to the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but does not want to invest their own money especially in this.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have a 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to get the debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">The campaign I've already invested 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I do not have sponsors, suggests that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign I essentially cover the senatorial salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn money, so they would not stand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">This means that you will be engaged in business, it is possible to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Don't you say that reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partially reduced its activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like, that I was Bessrebrenniko that will keep the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also want something to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two to four hundred thousand that get further.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I became president, then its business would be finished.</seg>

<seg id="8">It has a population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and built seven fictional bridges that are depicted on the euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame the Maas of Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar graphs and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, took to task with his usual unflappable and appeared on the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, defiant Maas abdicate from its original gift Piramidu in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "Dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here it is, my proposal: "the book Mountains in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain value of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November, "the book of the Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the contest "the best Library of the Netherlands in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The plan also participates in the Dutch national contest of wooden structures in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not suggest anything, in addition to the postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of the plant was richer for a piece of modern architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the main thing is the first in the history of this town of Spijkenisse appeared in public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: the Eldorado under the cap for the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only one elevator, held in the heart of the mountains, because the real aficionados of architecture and reading will explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">The glass from all sides-bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and stylish street lamps unmistakably create a sense of public square in the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment recreated perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="26">The views unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and playing football in the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere-books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually bookshelves are located along the facades, in the middle of the big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says blame the Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have a classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner space book mountains used skillfully: in the heart of the offices, the Internet-library, chess clubs, environmental and technical facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially with black bookcases that serve to finish the walls, the shade, the stair railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their view, texture and smell of unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in the guesswork, what is the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We have to work with secondary materials," says Joop Traborst, the head of the project, representing the community of Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a byproduct of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of artificial fiber materials mm thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textile is one-two of the season, then it can be released.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes was pressed in the thickness of four cm.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the heat and pressure the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable materials, fragrances is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top by 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">Those who overcome by nearly 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquet and wood Ficusami in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, first and foremost about the proper humidity on the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The cost of a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It is hard to believe, but this building, in spite of the many glass, is a model of the project in terms of ecology," says Troborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The warmth of the land is used for heating and cooling.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book Gore is the bell jar, even in the days of the Sun is the only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad farms of laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, give and take on a large part of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection of fully automatic roller-blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Permon, the aforesaid skeptics from it, has already visited a new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lizette Veraig also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, which called Bukenberg "soul Spijkenisse, which not long enough."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book of its own assembly.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were to take the blank spaces on the shelves is not yet fully staffed libraries is at the moment it was of 70,000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves to get to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than empty the library," says the architect blame the Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way associated with this new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the problem, the professional jargon called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And they are very young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is only the starting point for the development of identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany will need to be careful because of its special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that the American position it also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence while not acting too critical towards Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the NATO held this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complicated international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely from the policy, which, so to speak, led by the US, the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have not agreed a unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that as long as they are just groping their role, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specific means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This willingness to take in their national position, does not depend on the position of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other major countries, and so Germany must defend their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Whether these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the countries of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, she should be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not attach too much importance, it is not completely one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether Germany will harm its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the US is understanding of the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I don't think that it was such a dramatic step as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany may even will thus a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international arena and that its interests must be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">On the contrary, the US clearly voted for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there a divergence of opinion between the US and many European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The strength of the American domestic politics such differences existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of European positions.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly in such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as always.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not the policy of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany easily combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU with others?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes the situation is difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be few easier, if there is a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they cannot act within the framework of a broader approach and forced instead to act on its own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">This is the way they are with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This topic has always been delicate.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany sees itself as an important international player is not whether she will take a really the main role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or a leading role is still a hard Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far it is always hard to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various Antigermanski feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans did not just to cope with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view of Germany is much more precarious position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It should take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the impact of the US in European policy constantly weakened, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply have to play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like it, unpleasant or fueling enmity to you is life!</seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is the world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the names of firms, from which it is formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not sued.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then, it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for the company Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of the rights of the trademarks in the far east.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my table every week appears on a new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The simulator add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lu is derived from the Gucci-Gucci, Prada instead of Prada can be registered-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">The same way legally copied the German enterprises, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens the folder with the registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF, Puma artificial name, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese-World chess copied and violation of intellectual property rights, it is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there is multilevel stores selling almost exclusively of forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the case is not Pattla. on behalf of their clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the registration of trademarks the right to use the name, which already is somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it a "ban inpay," Mark-passengers.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word is associated with the "ban Dacuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">The so-called women who are hunting for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is detrimental to the business, it is necessary to fight," says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"trademark blurred, a unique situation is lost, the image is very much suffering."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copy products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research company CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and fastest-growing market for luxury items.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the Registry to remove the disputed trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells the story of cases in which the court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time to overturn the name was "the reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will have to pay the copycat, even as the damaged its trademark in China, "says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes possible the rule of law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, the company shortly before a firm-producer of concrete Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to a Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">To buy Volvo company Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo, BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The producer of fashion goods from Hong Kong and Singapore simulator Lacoste lost in China, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The registration of trademarks Ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment of the premises there had been difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year was "the return from an emergency situation in a workflow to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">However, the number of raw affairs objections decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, the 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the agency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To fight against this is expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the Ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This record and means that China for the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations around the world, according to the agency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same is true of the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">If the simplified, this means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The appeal it is many times, as the case shows the German family company Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of them fake car parts was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the simulator has for a Chinese rights to the trademark of Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was their own shortcomings, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, "says Hanno Ventler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the registration of trademarks Ctmo rejected the claim Munenev.</seg>
<seg id="54">The truth is that in both the following instances Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to be on the alert</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question is now pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Ventler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs are hardly accounting, the archive firms had to see even acts a hundred years ago to bring the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, the Freudenberg in vain proposed a side of the "great Sestisnacnuu amount in euros for a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"It is clear how expensive it to us," says Ventler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The danger of the far East threaten to spread even in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And in the case, if the simulators registered there for a unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of the Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to be vigilant," says Ventler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that somehow should protect register also in China," says Ventler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than a registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about the trademarks, will have to pay a license fee for a name, explains Ventler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise, we will from the market in the segment.</seg>

<seg id="39">What are the main striking the group?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer is as a result of sexual contact between men.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Perhaps the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Lippersheem-even before Galileo a year later began to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the rearview optical telescopes became more and deeper space available their view.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="58">The Mirror "big South African telescope" in South Africa segment for the sake of reducing the cost of.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tightly seal the vertical angle is limits his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope "Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle."</seg>
<seg id="62">His features: high Svetosobirautchaa ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">It is in spite of a relatively small diameter mirror-parameters of the world's largest telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="86">The scientists suggest that at the south pole of Mercury is ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data about it as a "messenger" moves closer to the north pole of the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar measurements for decades pointed out that the mercury is ice.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the running in 2004, the probe "Messenger" is the first, which revolves around Mercury-scientists now know it.</seg>

<seg id="17">The legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil from the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet reached.</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times, and he had 23 child at the age of 136 years he had allegedly born daughter.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto wearing the presidential sash and will take the reins of the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is no easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the administration of Felipe Calderon, who is now into its powers, but the country is mired in the drug war that has claimed some 60,000 lives for six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to fight violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto earlier this week US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Such statements with the President of the United States Mr. Pena Nieto developed political career as governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">At home, in the populous and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leaders are divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Straightforward people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In an idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents are credited him to revive tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">The city can be reached on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Pena Nieto, who are very different from those of the roads with potholes and Yam, who were previously on this site.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">"We hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman from the state led by Pena Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years of continuous stay in power party, the PRI was supplanted by Vicente Fox in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">The congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence at the Los Pinos presidential palace party has great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, he refutes accusations of meaningless that the new president of the opposition.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">But in other parts of the state, many people have different views of the former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name Ciudad Neza, is a stark contrast with the cobbled streets Valle de Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">The hidden under the overpass highways, he is in many ways a suburb of the city.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Nieto, at best, it is possible to say that about him during his tenure as governor, he could not cope with the problem of the killing of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst case, however, his administration accused of ignoring the problem.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="44">Wearing a presidential sash on Saturday, President of Pena Nieto together with it will take a hard responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised the crimes related to the violence, and the new president promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his rule.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning replied that he expressed oral concerns about these problems and that visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but it is not recorded in writing.</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that he was acquitted of "preventing injuries" mode and softened conditions.</seg>
<seg id="20">The representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited mode of detention at the lower level than supervision to prevent suicide was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the sake of security of others.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and eyeglasses were taken out of the camera.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense said that plans to offer Manning acknowledged the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges challenged as excessive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon argues that Manning was held in Vantiko in accordance with the rules governing the contents of those with the most strict regime.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis of the national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to flee to Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country of difficult times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American torn between the two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico I went along the corridor for arriving, close to the border zone and was on the spot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The signs pointed to the two: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A few seconds I stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my life called the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is just a name, just like my friends in Boston themselves as Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves to be Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I stayed on a complex construction "the Americans are of Mexican origin."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complicated constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary poorer than the native speakers, and I can't get rid of American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took his American passport and was in the queue for extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The president of Pena Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the president of Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but there was no concrete proposals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans never thought about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the barrel of a gun forced its leaders to refuse to half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see the reminders of those events around.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So it is worth only to any statesman US Obmolvites while word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society, there are complaints that Americans encroaches on the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of Montezuma Preispolnats militancy.</seg>

<seg id="27">The most complex are relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans are of Mexican origin living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about revenge?</seg>
<seg id="29">Them enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who are in the country for themselves, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of someone who is the father or grandfather did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most of these were Mexicans a certain type of-two, a swarthy, untrained and poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Their descendants, and we remember about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico, see it differently.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and get a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination and it is unclear, but we know what the country believes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Moreover, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as inauthentic Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not speak Spanish well, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them due to the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would not now behind the silk curtain, found in the US and the smug life, but lost spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US in childhood, and it reminds me that there are certain friction between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin: Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Mexican Americans is a shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She is a US citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not belong to any one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we are Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the US, we are Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I learned during his trip, like our relations without having not intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to the Mexican Americans worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell his fellow Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great it to visit, and could convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yeah, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing.</seg>
<seg id="57">There are too many grievances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sorry, but to deal with this ourselves, Migos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If the Mexicans still could not forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in bitterness for how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle on the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become a fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If it is possible to have long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are, as usual, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the suburbs of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in his eternal conflict, the Middle East, came to change.</seg>
<seg id="7">This can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab spring "spin in the rebellious storm set of realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the vortex, shook the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed this week, the clashes only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, who came to power in Gaza in 2007, said from the fact that they forced Israel to back down, despite their losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, the Hamas increases its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another of the Palestinian-controlled territory the more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may come to the conclusion that the time is working on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world have Hamas new powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The victorious Hamas supporters claim the creation of around Israel Islamic crescent from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more Proislamistski insurgents is overthrown the power of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where King authorities threaten allies of Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant changes to the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, the most populous and important Arab country in Egypt, where the President Mohamed Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, do not pay special attention to the support of Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, are organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomatic understatement Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the supporters of the "hard line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" to justify the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israeli citizens can sleep, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, the United States remained loyal to its unchanged position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis died from missiles, launched from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized of a Palestinian state and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party is in preparation for the January 22 elections is merged with even more aggressively-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is the meaning of pandering to the Palestinians and give them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If their hands to all the power on the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from missiles in the direction of Israel, as their brethren do in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind the wall and to suppress any attempt to raise the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, the supporters of the "hard" lines are victorious; but their calculations can be refuted the Arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Despite the fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority to domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel's defense budget of more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">The war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark a beginning of change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the democratic change in the Arab countries, the denial of the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, sooner or later, like bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression has to undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population only exacerbates these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">For the bloody operation, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, has to pay the growing discontent of the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need in the external impulse</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The only solution is to work tirelessly for sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of the two countries and territories in exchange for security concessions to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is hope, not too big in the short term, the hope that the ceasefire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which is a long time to make a decision to cut off weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, with regard to the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries should also make efforts to the reconciliation of Hamas and Fatah movements.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more than for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote at the UN, the result of which may be a recognition of a Palestinian statehood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Its role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is tragically shortsighted position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, the law came into force of the unified packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The warnings on the harmful effects of smoking and images are affected by diseases parts of the body contrasting on depressed green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in the world practice the Australian law type a pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color of different brands of the same olive flowers with nasty-a bleak snapshot of affected parts of the body and the images of children, their parents' health of smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the wads, introduced in a compulsory manner with this Saturday-name brands that printed the same fine print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basis of such a decision based on the results of the research showed that people, not starting up to 26 years in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is obvious that even at a young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains the health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing research showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so that these changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of such measures are already considering and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will be supplied much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, the new laws to promote the growth of the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Hu from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases to hide the unpleasant pictures on the package, rapidly increased (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Sandra Hu, Zico is already has about six thousand products to the wholesale trade and expects the new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a good business for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The potential is a hindrance for the effectiveness of such measures, according to experts, the popularity of social networking is part of the population, which are these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the adoption of a series of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting cigarette sellers to the Internet, the advertising of tobacco products moved.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise in the network, but it cannot limit in the foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you sell tobacco and you have only a small loophole, the idea is to promote their goods on the Internet you will find very attractive," says Beck Freeman, the question of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman says the growing number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of the supposedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this was the work of ordinary citizens who are so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare forces and time and made a video, or advertising campaign is behind this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules that the advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: These states are claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relationship with Australia is very insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada was the first introduced compulsory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it is a rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia, he did not obey innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures I do not graze.</seg>
<seg id="33">I just do not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Just Vihvativaes a cigarette and hides pack in your pocket," explains Viktor El Haig, who cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor mouth on the blister.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, the only thing that can make me to is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yiu, head of the Tobacco store of king of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package will complicate the task of goods on shelves</seg>
<seg id="37">"I have used the unloading of a new party had gone an hour, and now four hours," he says.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government had to take and it was not forbidden cigarettes, then we would say what to do, okay, it's over, closes the shop," he says, hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Miss in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of the plane appeared to have mechanical failures and replaced by another plane, the US and wait.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had enough time thinking about the nature of the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not deceive you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help books, magazines, or the iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists on child development are in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children here is not so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">This causes the brain is distracted by interesting topics that may contribute to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">As in the modern world, we are constantly before any screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we need to seek to boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time is not.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will come back to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before I, like many, believes that the boredom of an invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is not so, says Peter Tuia, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, the author of the book "a fascinating history of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"actually boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating from the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This remains an open question of how we understand the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, "says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom often changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The materials research on the topic and asked the target group of 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but may not engage in what would bring them satisfaction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between the boredom and apathy, he says, is that the bored man does not do something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy to do nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main worry about the boredom, he says, is "a violation of attention and associated with the deterioration of sentiment and feeling that the time is slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The description of the boredom may seem very similar to the Depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people saw the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people who worry depression, see the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact it is just difficult for us to focus on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "vacant mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor of Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, whose members listened to recordings of voices, read a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the other programs included in the next room, heard the sounds at low volume, so that they hardly could be dismantled, and the third group listened to the recording votes without a sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that it was boring, most of it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task interruption attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. fence, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelphs, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we are doing something interesting, "for example, peering into the flow of the pipeline in the search for marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Second, he says that when people are swaying on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually such actions are simply not relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The study found that children who do not prohibit fidget and swirl, learn better and remember more information than children, which require sit," says Professor of the fence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we all feel bored: the delay flight (as in my case), listening to the film monotonous speech, watching uninteresting.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s for measuring such individual researchers have developed a special "a propensity to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Questions are used to determine the estimates of such a scale and approval, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and monotonously" or "I'm too much, so all that he did not have enough time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have determined that the boys bored more girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly when there are a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, the teenagers are often bored at all.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, during which he contacted by pager almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He got the following results: 32% of the teenagers declared that they get bored at the school and during the homework, and 23% announced that they get bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they get bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would be the data about the boredom now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, he knows that "adolescence is the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents do not allow fully to decide what they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Go back to my original question: boredom is useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations, studies have shown that it can encourage people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, "says Professor Wodanovic, dedicated to study the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain tells us that it is necessary to do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">However, the brain is not always knows what to do better.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you will get bored and you this energy to play the guitar or culinary experience, you make yourself better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if you miss your child and give him the iPad, he will not get bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom alone or otherwise to manage their time and employment, "says Professor fence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"Skills such self-regulatory uses in various situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only occupy themselves something, he also learns self-control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that the tedium to somehow praised.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, it is not worth something bad, too.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, it is necessary to learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technologies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agree with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We see this, so we need more bored, that the boredom is extremely unpleasant, was an insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">Indeed, the people are trying to disconnect the permanent worries and just relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulate the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we lost and did not know what to do."</seg>

<seg id="6">But the criminals?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for a few weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small prosecutions depends not so much from the law, how many from the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already are in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped the accusations of the people in the age of 21 and older for the storage of small doses that will be considered legitimate, as just a couple of weeks, the law will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing business related to marijuana, and still attract the responsibility for the storage of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from suburban Denver to the mountain areas of the West vote for their places in order to prevent the emergence of new licensed state stores to sell marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"It is growing so rapidly that I don't even know what to expect further," says Daniel J. Oates, the head of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington also puzzled by the scratches to the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They have established the rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it needs to be done before on December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that the Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in settling the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example, "explains Brian I. Smith, a spokesman of the council for the regulation of alcohol production and sales in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can do more, acknowledges that Mr. Smith, put forward some proposals and we hope that it will work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent that we could find," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and the whole year plunge us into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right to possession of marijuana is legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the decree of the state of "adequate access" to its licensed marijuana with a ban on trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Trade will be especially difficult to publish licensed Enterprise marijuana in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," says Ben Livingston, the representative of the newly formed group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent his e-mail that the prosecutor's office of the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police will stop people caught in these violations "from this moment."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The head of the police, Oates said that the police will supervise in the city of rules governing the activities of individuals, grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal drug traffickers and distributors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Weld County prosecutor Ken Buck, in the north of Colorado, is more rigorous approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill, he stated that the public prosecutor's office will continue to responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of its treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment of 119 persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"The duty of our institutions, prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the time of their committing," Mr. Baku said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police Grand Junction, the biggest city in the district, no longer appeals to the responsibility of the adult for possession of small amounts of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw accusations on already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that enforce the law, until he does not change our direct responsibilities," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55% of the population of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">A controversial reaction of residents in different places of the ambiguity in the relations of the local authorities to experiment with marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"There is a cultural barrier district prosecutors in this regard," says Sean MacAlister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They harassed people for this for so long that now cannot truly come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington-the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are the same as alcohol-destined to become experimental field across the country to verify the idea of legalizing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates of legalization and officials of the state plan to expand the territory to legalize trade, but at the same time they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who continued to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will give on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several received a wide response arrests of traders and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave good on trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Agents of the Bureau for the Fight against drugs are unlikely to be broke into houses to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are hardly going to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of the state, recreational marijuana shops that are permitted under the new law, believes Kevin A. Sabet, the former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential elections, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores in the sale of marijuana, who would not be able to open sooner than a year later.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which are likely to be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to be in a position that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendments.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we have, there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and voted for that.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is still a lot of unresolved issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Barker Wayett: I survived from Oxford for what I conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="2">The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As I can remember, I always dreamed of enrolled at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world institution, the modern counterpart of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization-thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of study at the department of history at Worcester College at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father did not pass and burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">The friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out, because I didn't like the fact that my fellow classmates sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer, E.E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the greasy cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Indeed, it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not because of my quite unusual name or that I studied in a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was persecuted for only one reason, the cradle of the Enlightenment it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wayett, was known as an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was the Conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why should remember about it now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, the center-right views, is the same harassment.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institutionalized and growing hatred of the conservatives students at Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one which is handicapped, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that they "are often subjected to personal attacks and actively isolate feels unwanted guests because of their political views."</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to enter the college of additional representative in the committee on equal rights to ensure freedom of expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on the BBC 2 documentaries about politics in the student environment "Wonderland: a young, smart and the right," in which conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University who travels in a Rolls-Royces, a silver suit and silver knobby cane.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Conservatives complain that students at other universities of making them "scapegoats for raising the cost of study."</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke black, 20 years, the vice-president of the Association of conservatives at Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper said that "in the university environment increases distortions in the side of the left.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people who we don't even know in advance that we brazen and gratuitously disruptive children of wealthy parents. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the historical faculty of Corpus Christi College, which was filed a petition to strengthen protection of such an atmosphere, calls "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to media center-right views has deteriorated significantly.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussions and just for a normal life of the members of the club," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was the one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I was there in September 1986, 18 Timid and shy girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford -- from the hatred of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="30">The year before the university by the former student Margaret Thatcher its honorary degree because of the higher education budget cuts.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that what awaited me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I still do not know that teachers not only looked through the fingers at Pom conservatives, but students and gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The political questions are the miners' strike, the privatization of the government and the opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa-penetrate Obitie panelled walls audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first workshop I needed to translate the French of the eighteenth century English, and I was not ready for that followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wayett," said the professor, the late Harry Pitt, please, translate the first paragraph. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was me hard, I stumble.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like the cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Tatceristi not teach the French or they just drain is not enough?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students giggled.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes were full of tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise you to take some initial lessons of the French in his spare time, if you are, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," Probrusal Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room totally miserable.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the evening in college I was sitting for dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, the second-year student of English who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives, will be tortured.</seg>
<seg id="49">To me it is not easy, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they labor. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, I too cowardly to it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that do not all that, "says Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">The students of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economy, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of fascist swines.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contagious. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was flawed, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"The Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59">"They are smashing each other, the truth?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like it should be felt homosexuals before the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the Sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">If I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or I will have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">If I was forced to become a Labour and hide their true beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">The upcoming me three years to become seems hell, full of hardship and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Only a lecturer in my college, did not hide his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to the Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speech.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he practically does not appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised his remoteness, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-Deterministskom view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you won't be happy," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I went to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and friends in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and explain the cause.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in 1940 there were any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best universities in the world," he said Alobno.</seg>
<seg id="76">"There is not capable, not only in the town of slumbering spires ...</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends, the Communists always behaved impeccably. "</seg>
<seg id="78">His wet eyes grow dull.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Do not take any hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that it is just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You broke my heart, if you University. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was exhausted by constant visits to London and my emotional protection of weakening.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, also conservative, could not withstand the pressure and refused to their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people, I decided to do so."</seg>
<seg id="85">In the soul burning shame, I admitted that "I clean the brains parents," and called them the "old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time, he wrote two columns for weekly publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was not out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I did not returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me Plasoy and a rag.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in the eighteen years no one should not become an object of such anger and intimidation in the institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released Fourteen heads of government of the Tories, but still behind the undeserved reputation of the university, where the value of equality and thinking.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their job is hell, while others are literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them are Zaporizhzha Widjaja, one of 400 miners who earn a living prey of sulphur in the volcano Kawa-Idena, located on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day, the Zaporizhzha descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, place a basket on his shoulders and carries them up the precipitous rocky road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, just 250 meters, but exhausted loading it takes more than 40 minutes to climb the snail's pace, with difficulty restraining balance and careful not to stumble and fumble the road has not fallen off the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong step could cost him his life, as happened with a tourist from France, which failed a few years ago with rocks Kawa-Idena.</seg>

<seg id="9">The miners with kava-Idena earn 5 euro for each kilogram of sulphur that drill</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">Being at the top, they are paving a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were apes from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, walked three kilometers to weights that mining company is a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are talking about the PT Kandy Grimbi, the company that operates this volcano since 1960, and it is best not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) for each kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro) petrochemical production, the minerals is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, Cai, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching.</seg>

<seg id="13">"As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each Hoku," explains US Zaporizhzha, which usually operates three daily carrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels heartbroken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems to be nothing for such a superhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Podenna fee miners is very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">His salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the Zaporizhzha was not so heavy, but returned with his family in Baneuvangi, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same as massive as Gray: "I married the girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought it on Java to embrace Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing and he has eyes because of the toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years Zaporizhzha spent three years, risking a kava-Idena sulphur, which has already started to affect him despite the availability of masks and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing and he has eyes because of toxic gas, which emits a volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to work for another two years, because I want to open the shop or the French or Spanish," he promises more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This pleasant and intelligent young man punished life, could be a tourist guide, the waiter, or the receptionist at the hotel, but instead he performs mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dividing dirty wooden hut with other porters, he rises every day in the two hours of the night, because Gray does not cease to flow out at night, when its characteristic yellow into blue and brilliant among the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, Zaporizhzha down in the crater, covering the way a small flashlight, attached to his helmet, which he bought for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Around 400 porters to drag basket with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite the high profits, the mining company not mechanized extraction sulphur savings and does not provide any equipment for porters, who are working on their own account and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they do not even part of a fee of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros), which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work for cattle, not for the people," says Barusin, stocky porters 42 years, who spent on kava-Idena three decades, since he left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is capable of up to 110 pounds, he insists he will work "as much as we can," because he needed money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Do not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although Gray is burning throats and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changed and catches of miners in the dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy, that no one complains about their heavy disease ... more serious, it is clear that their habitual arthrosis, pain in his knees, breathing problems and ulcers on the shoulders that deformed under the weight of Corzine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Hovering basket on his back, now only Uninik can raise the 50 kilogram in its 53 years.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These phrases are part of rap, which uses the local proverb like "Let's put bao (buns) in the stove," to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH, the hope that with the help of advertising will be able to draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to the people "of its national debt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst of their kind in the world, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government is trying to do so much, for example, launching perfume with pheromones or organized parties fast dating (blitz-visits).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why don't we do the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 child</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Those who do not accept this so lightly, it is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends 1,300 US dollars a year on policy for the enthusiasm of the citizens of the birth of more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for couples and parents offers up to 15,000 dollars a child, extend maternity and provide tax breaks for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it has a low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is the rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, is also a certain conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birthrate in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time he was below the 2-what is known as a percentage of replacement in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why the Singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang Wei Ming, director of policy for couples and families of the national office of population, says that the reason "improved education" and "a broader range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"It is allowed to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of the family," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes to the social norms that contribute to the growth of the number of bachelor and long delays of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are Web sites, where is barely concealed xenophobia in relation to many of the new immigrants, especially Chinese, have criticized for keeping wages low and unwillingness to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of the immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year was the worst result of the election since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of the quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While falling fertility has a certain impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, for example, Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is making efforts to are not so much a small housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is the beginning of the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">A guide to urban development shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments 46 square meters are sold very well.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to the bachelor lifestyle and deprived of incentive to developers who want to build a large family housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yu Sun, the general director of construction firm El developers, says that "boxes of shoes sold much faster than the more spacious copies."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than the larger apartments.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash inflow increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers who used to diagnose obstacles if they want to offer too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too overstretched</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national rate, after a conversation with the Singaporeans, who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very overstretched, expensive, as well as housing, education, and because of this many people this delay," says a young managers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people may have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention of his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that they have a child.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the relations of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our country and forming a new economic scheme," the Peruvian president said in the message read.</seg>

<seg id="17">We are not talking about human rights, it is in this case, we do not use, but there were constant discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is a number of processes in various European instances," he mentioned.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The mortality rate from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It stunned me," he recalls the difficult moment, despite all the cycle of a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man concealed it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. and his efforts to materialize, he has already celebrated the 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, breaking a lot of obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 22 years. In the early 1990s in it would be hard to believe is too little, then there are options for treatment, too little is known about the disease, were too biased to the sick.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had cuts."</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, those times have AIDS was a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and did not worsening the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, I don't know about his illness, many people still come, when the virus is already damaged, "drained" of their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious science publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectious and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, the patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD 4, and up to 50 years, when the reported 500 CD 4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that those who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To assess this progress, it should be remembered that Mexicans today the average life expectancy is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Jalisco 255 people have died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Why there are still a lethal outcome?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I imagine it, so is the case in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that the patients come very late, because they don't know their HIV status, i.e., the stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He led the crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunistic infections; that needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality is able to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that this will be asked."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In his proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabricio, who turned to check in a private laboratory Pobugdennia only by the fact that it has made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that will die, and do not want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"still die, the better I shit three times a week," they say. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I eat well, I do my exercises, accept drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of class, I am an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of yourself and the other man," listed Fabricio, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to its statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let them get if was the risk of contamination, even as soon as possible to learn whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have the diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, was responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is his message summarizes the theme of the struggle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms are behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">A large gap between programs in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, which has a problem associated with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, devoted to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, used to give us one or two, now we give packages hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still does not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why are you?" is a popular issue with Eidstwom and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees at pharmacies and health care workers, who do not want to hear the teenagers, assured propagandists.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this inefficient distribution of condoms were not only for the largesse to hundreds of them was in machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not promote promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not talking about the payment of beer and the motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether it is possible the distribution of condoms under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It is not sexuality, the best way to make condoms available for those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key data in Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Registered 13,435 total 1,317 HIV/AIDS cases (12,158).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state takes the 4th place in the national rating on new and total cases of HIV/AIDS and the 13th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92 percent of infections are sexually, 6% of the blood and 2% to perinatal route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, like the one registered case there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.</seg>

<seg id="2">The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years is connected to this sport and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And before a brain haemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years as a player in the small categories, the player of basketball league, the commissioner and the head of BSN with Cowboys Bamon and president of the Basketball Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, like when I was the president of BSN, the director-general of the national team and the president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit to his home in Bamon Primera Hora, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabel, for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes did not exaggerating, making this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia gathered for a long way to go, the evidence of this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bamon in the heart of the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his speech in the role of the co-agent or an agent of the contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"It was my best years that I enjoyed the most, because the Cowboys had the opportunity to be part of eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was for many years, including five Serie A, the last from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut Jerome Minsky in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since then, and continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Jin Bartova, who was sent here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, the rise of the 6'7."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Do you want?"</seg>
<seg id="17">This was the beginning of Minsky, one of the best players, who have been in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartova then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if Minsky brought the championship Bamon, Gauss would help win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship Cowboys with Gauss I enjoy, but it is already at a distance, because to 1988, the head of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By the time I prefer to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements of Minsky in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember how we won for the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judges who made the final game to beat us, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She is among the best, as well as a dream team that won at the Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was that the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the US team, which was quite similar to that won a bronze at the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">The team not only again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Pikulina" (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) 'Tonito' colon and James Carter, the brother of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team in the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role players like 'Kanito' Nevesa, Pablo Alisa and the young Rolando Hurritnera replace the players, temporarily suspended for the riots in Mar del Plata Pan American championship, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His performance at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level, as it did Pikulin.</seg>
<seg id="34">And it is without taking into account of his career in different leagues in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good young, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandit Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">The young, I really like the work of Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think its main achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s in BSN before 17 teams in the season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What do you have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of the smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, to boys of Ponce played only in the field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now they travel and play too much, and it is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I can see the fruits of a compulsory certification and course for the board of governors, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">It gives me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally walk on basketball matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been with me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The course, which examines "the end of the world."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, students are apocalyptic phenomena, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Sharm decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of a long countdown "the Mayan calendar on December 21, for which many people seized as evidence that is the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Sharm had no idea that he expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "Dolgoarmagedonom," and the growing conflict, where involved Israel, a place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times, believe that the start of the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma said this week students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we have only 30 days, it was really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that the worst is good for those who have an apocalyptic mind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the sole professor, which offers courses on the theme "doomsday" in theory this semester, the latest in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Templiscom University associate professor Barry Wacker-reads the course, "the media, culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, students are apocalyptic themes, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze why these ideas are over time," he said, and the way in which offer the hypothetical scenarios that certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, can an outbreak of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, the students analyzed the movies on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they correlate with examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell students that perhaps likely, plausible and it is impossible," said Wacker -.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is simply called "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We do not add '2012 ' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "imminent destruction," the students must learn to prepare projects and to take final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Penn State final exam will be accepted on the eve of the apocalypse that leaves no choice but to work "to students that night, in which presumably will be the end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"The place of torment for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with high average scores, which signed 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received e-mails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked whether there are still places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I like to see what people do to soothe yourself," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology of Hadonfilda, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or lack of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing affairs, said that looked all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I never heard about the course, which would be taught," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I like it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students surveyed-not to mention the professor is not said that believes in the doomsday date on December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project touched the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Seglen, a 21-year-old student last year in Templiscom University of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which counts for several centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused an increase of these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other places people do not think about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mainly in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knows about the course of "the end of the light there."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall pointed out that for a long time about many days, the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that on December 21, the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some say that are going to go to the parties "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Maybe call someone from friends, to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student.</seg>
