<h1>
<seg id="1">The republican strategy resistance re-elected obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified its policy struggle against spin in the election.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the center of the brennan as the last myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the united states more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Besides lawyers republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense of such acts are partly discredited system of american democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike canada american states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the united states.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why most state governments since 2009 pass laws that make it difficult to register or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the election in november 2010, which brought the republican-controlled 675 new places in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only for one year 2011 was made 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new laws on elections require voters to present photo identification and proof of the american citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolished the right of voter registration in the day will and undercut the right to vote with the citizens, with a previous conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the election of 2006, no american state does not oblige voters to present photo identification.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana is the first state, who introduced a similar requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The us supreme court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law adopted in indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years, they initiated bills that obligate voters to present photo id, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that unlike the quebec american citizens do not have such universal id cards, as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of american citizens, there are 21 million people, reached voting age have no photo id issued by the governmental body of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the cost of the required id often exceeds $100.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% african american, 15% of people earning less than 35 thousand dollars, 18% citizens older than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo id.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from the democrats, in several states were not allowed to use photo identification, issued by their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state did not require evidence of the american citizenship for voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time a similar requirement was introduced in arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the united states.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, obviously, aimed to restrict voting hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is believed that two thirds of hispanic voters votes in favour of the democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, republican lawmakers launched in 2011 laws, abolished voter registration in the day of voting in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction has not passed without any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the election of 2004 campaign for the registration of voters helped to make in the list of about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall on 17% level of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, republican legislators passed in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, during the general election 2008 florida 33% of voters vote ahead of schedule, were african americans, while the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened with descending from latin america.</seg>
<seg id="40">Only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.</seg>
<seg id="41">Unlike the whites, who, forming 76% of voters, among early votes accounted for just 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, laws and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects laws was ветировано governor.</seg>
<seg id="44">The action as ambiguous laws was suspended with the involvement attorney general of the united states.</seg>
<seg id="45">It allowed partially limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the photo id.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules in effect, of course, plague the implementation of the electoral law in the election of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Criticism from democrats denounce contempt laws, which were adopted, seeing the obvious directions to affect the results of the 2012 elections, in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the brennan from 2011 shows that states that have these laws are 171 of 270 votes needed in the electoral college, to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of presidential elections 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing is certain of these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense of such acts are partly discredited system of american democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening prostate cancer: test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the test for the dog gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to uselessly medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">Men, and so reluctant to light the dispensaries have from what hesitate even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the research, conducted in the united states have been observed numerous cases of infection among groups of research, however obtained data are difficult to interpret and it is hard to develop any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time, european found different levels of mortality among those patients who were screened, and those who did not take place at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This survey also showed after a 12-year observation that the likelihood of metastasis on 30-40% higher than those who did not pass the screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, i would recommend a test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Black men also are at heightened risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is a good decision making, as soon as the cancer was detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">A cancer may be as aggressive and low-level.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer diseases, offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long run, and making the choice in these cases, in favor of active surveillance disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men, who have revealed the cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, as their cancer not aggressive and not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly we have the exact criteria for deciding who should or should not be the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, i'd recommend still test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international association of urology, created мовембер tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons test on the dog.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent a disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is a miracle to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, compliance with a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is believed that if all great people ate and enough, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">``If no one never smoked, this figure would be at least 50%, ''said andré beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain utterly unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the canadian cancer association anti-tobacco movement remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is connected with 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It deals a tremendous damage to the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">``Even today in quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers, ''said spokesman andre beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Promising fact: ten years after smoking the risk of dying from cancer decreases in half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">``Research shows that regular physical activity throughout his life protects from colon cancer, ''added to the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities, it increases the risks of colon cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">You should also avoid sausages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Canned meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">``The last may harm the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer, ''explained in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have influence vitamin on the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But at this point, the results of these studies is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the scc, research vitamin e give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin d is also no full clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">But mr. beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and the family anamnesis it is important to discuss with your doctor.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs boson in detail.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last summer, the message that scientists, perhaps, managed to discover the higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is considered, that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing so much.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or in any case, ``less imperfect ''descriptions of nature and the behavior of the matter, but which had not been found by experience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physicists have still not sure that the question is about бозоне higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without any doubt that we deal with a really new particle and that she was reminiscent of the higgs boson predicted the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data presented on this week on a single major physical congress in kyoto, it seems, confirm it, although for a full confidence of some information is not enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine what we are talking about бозоне higgs, because the odds of mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There are, in this world one law is inevitable, which said that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around this rule there is no way, do not even try too hard, or to harm himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although elementary particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that in her too have one law of similar nature: the principle of exclusion pauli, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space in the same time, if they are in the same ``quantum state ''is`` condition'' is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On this basis, physics share particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find the good citizens, called fermion, who wisely obey the principle of pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In another scurrying around бозоны, mean gang anarchists, which have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can safely be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the site (incidentally, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory at berkeley, these бозоны section in turn, on the two groups: meson, about which we are here we are not gon na talk, and ``particles of power '', through which the forces of nature and in some kind of higgs boson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly simply бозону: фотону, or particles of light, ''which is a ``courier'' of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when a piece with the electrical charge, or changes direction, this ``violations ''electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this ``violations ''born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation or ultrasound, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than photons - and, therefore, one of the bosons`` vectors of power''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same happens with the higgs boson, with the only difference that this boson appeared, should be ``violated ''different field, higgs field.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the higgs field much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to his institute, need to achieve a very, very high energies, as if it was a frozen pond surface, which could only be shaken by very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as the one that is operated in cern, the large hadron collider, a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! - to achieve such huge energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the balance between the higgs boson and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, himself never will stay on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles interact with the higgs: those who interact, have mass while others (like the photon, by the way it did not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what can bring ``all of these studies, asks ms plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science, they are used to validate the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find divergence between the results of observations and forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, some of them passionately eager to this divergence exposed to the discrepancy could open the door for a ``new physics ''and plug some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">Last, needless to say, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms around 80% of the universe (uh-oh!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But while at cern such conflict is not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Benefit from these studies for everyday life of the average person it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not present.</seg>
<seg id="35">Watch: in the early 1960s pioneers of the laser research laboratory in bell could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, late physicist willard boyle, who has worked in bell laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and he developed the first continuous laser (previous lyrics impulse) in 1962, said that the laser was seen as a ``lab gadget. ''</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application may be a tool, accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same williams boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although it was not his original purpose, now serves as a ``eye ''for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the nobel prize in physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, it does not mean that the work of the large hadron collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that it can be.</seg>

<seg id="9">``But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare, ''he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not to walk into the bathroom and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agreed to help him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He lifts, even manages to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead him in the tub.</seg>

<seg id="14">``My greatest desire to treat me from diarrhea, it's humiliating, ''he admits.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">``Everything depends on the person's ability to`` deal with the rebound, ''he said.</seg>

<seg id="20">Patients who act in palliative shelter, victor all ill cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts shut them for a maximum of three months of life.</seg>

<seg id="31">In quebec for every 11 700 people are one place in the institutions of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very small, given that sooner or later we are all dead.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">``In the past six months from three to five beds, are always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years, ''says dr. christiane martel concerns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients taken in an orphanage, victor arrive from home, and 47% from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is believed that 77% of canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.&space;e. to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering of the patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in an orphanage.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as shelter viktor and society of palliative care at home of a large montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This is a large gap in health system of quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care to fear the law legalizing euthanasia and assistance in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since october circulates a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, dr. balfour's mother will маунтом and dr. bernard ляпуантом witnesses and about their disagreement with similar initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to dr. christiane martel, the health system, quebec insufficient to secure the right to palliative care of high quality before will be allowed to transfer of euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, ''she says, ``i saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hope for survival ellen richard already were minimal, when she stopped grueling chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When i told my oncologist, that i am stopping the treatment, she says to me that he regrets that i am stopping the fight, ''she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time, she said that my days are numbered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">An omnipotent care is not present</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. martel estimates that 90% of patients who ask about death, the medical staff for what they are not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care makes their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the struggle with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to elsie monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of a large montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthetic in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping until his death, or from time to time, or are constantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">One should not pretend that we do not know about these suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">It is more and more often, patients that fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: ``i want to die. ''</seg>
<seg id="65">But it does not necessarily mean ``i want to get a euthanasia, ''it means,`` i want to get easier.''</seg>

<seg id="36">The government of quebec offers limit to $100 donation parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: ``while we will not strictly limit elective expenses in politics are dirty money. ''</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires a complete overhaul of the system for provision of public contracts and financing parties: ``we can not sink below; boldly carefully in the essence of things, we can build a house on a good foundation, with the best control and the rule of law. ''</seg>

<seg id="9">And during the match, it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything happens very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But i do not disintegrated.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning in the center of the preliminary preparation in ниф in clairfontaine and till i came in as saint-étienne i always strode forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you benefit from competition, established by carlo ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">Completion of this summer is not new in matches to play a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also knows that every training session is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that a player, as i am eager to be at the level and giving to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, carlo ancelotti has supported in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Supported by his deputy, such as claude makélélé, who played in the same position, that i have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti - on the grill?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti commands respect for the technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first league does not equal and he is the best trainers in europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles in paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In january, i have with him was encouraging conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then i moved from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which he has, i also explains my accomplishments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season psg?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league lyon took we got a leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is champions league: we effectively qualify in one eighth in the finals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to pass as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good european teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">First we want to finish first in our group, before porto to have the opportunity to take the return match in one in eight matches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether psg to become the first european club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has a budget.</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major european club of paris, it is necessary to win titles and cement the position of a long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it's not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially at psg have the resources to do this project effective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Do not take the title in the first league, as in the past season, would be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a huge disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this year we fervently wish to get this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were this close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In may, it was disappointed, because we had everything to come to the finish line first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points implies a champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the other team, montpellier, played a fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this year, i think it will be fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that the fight for the title entered such strong team like marcel, lyon and bordeaux, i think that we have the strength to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">You do not think that the media are too much from paris st germain?</seg>
<seg id="55">It's okay, that we are expected to make a lot, considering how much was invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully prepared for it.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we are home win 4-0 against troyes and we find to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what primarily expect us to people.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We do not fc barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to implement the project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proved in the champions league, that we can answer the challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at manchester united, which already has two seasons, failing to pass in one eighth finals, although they have spent a lot of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the invested sum, we represent you in 15 points ahead already for the winter months.</seg>
<seg id="66">It would be a disdain for our opponents and the championship in france.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were ``awakening ''in this new psg.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how entertaining first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in may, we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paris st germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the feats of zlatan ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Well, if they say that there is a ``zlatan. ''</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that ibrahimovic very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came for this purpose, and he proves that he was a star of the first league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he played, he indicated that he was a great player and a star of a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we respect him as a person as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects people who surround him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it's really only.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates and other to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you survived the euro-2012 with french national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I earnestly wished to participate in this euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a little playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there many things, and i came out stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today i manage to play good qualifier matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">That's what i hoped for from the moment of my baptism in blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned some lessons from what happened in ukraine, and now have to behave samples.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months of didier дешама led by blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They are for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in the world cup for the world cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">He's tough coach, he is close with the players and inspires us to victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was laurent blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But i would not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that didier deschamps will lead blue in brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">A deserved draw (1-1), pulled on october 16 in spain - this is a fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us the belief in themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">The complete opposite of the current currency exchange, which is based on the center, numbered transactions between recipient c commission fees on their processing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as it often happens with these technologies, obvious political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, the bitcoin, invented satoshi nakamora. (a pseudonym), at the same time is the virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...), and secure protocols by the type of bittorrent, which allows the file sharing between the members of the same level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few thousand sites take биткойны for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course биткойна, reaching high at $30 (23 euros) in june 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning today by approximately ten dollars (courses indicated on the website bitcoincharts. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the european central bank (ecb) in his report about virtual currency, published in october, interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes биткойн as ``the most successful virtual currency '',`` competition with dollars or euros'' and ``similar to the common currency. ''</seg>
<seg id="11">Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currency, as ``credits ''for the promotion in a video game, which is made during the game, or who can buy (and sometimes exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network facebook has also developed such a system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But exchange operations always controls and processes any central authority.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all nodes биткойн networks are simultaneously holders ledgering, auditors, issuers, buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each deal between the two users actually occurs between two emails, like email.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only for each new payment, the user can select a different address, thus providing anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information relating to this transaction, email signature, using encryption with dual.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the file content, you may check that биткойны used in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book, sent along the entire network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks, sent computers, decided that, like a temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are talking about the phase of hashing file, i.&space;e. transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers take ``a new transaction and add to her room, before ''is`` all together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that offers a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily verify that it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is thus effectively нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If to cheat the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) might wish to pay twice by the same money, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the reward regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of биткойнов in circulation however limited 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred, which leaves another reserve.</seg>
<seg id="32">Complexity of the problem also increases with computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Life network has already experienced the ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sites that provide services of bitcoin, assault and биткойны were stolen from reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">``Defect does not concern the protocol, ''said pierre нуаза, which recently launched paymium - the company of payments in real money using the online bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ecb also reported about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But cash also possess this deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="38">The big players, such as wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as blog software wordpress, their permission.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, adi shamir and dorit ron from the weizmann institute in israel, analyzed the ledger and found that nearly 80% of биткойнов are not in the back.</seg>
<seg id="41">``Giant sell-off ''were announced in november.</seg>
<seg id="42">``Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged, ''glad jon холмквист working in coinabul engaged in convertibles биткойнов into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre нуаза, another author of books and manuals for this currency, a firm believer in the potential of this technology as the operating network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or infinite payment via a mobile phone, but she uses to verify bitcoin transactions, which thus goes cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The owner of better control of your personal information and can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new hardware or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to inform the address that you can photograph and recognize the phone, pierre нуаза, assurance that he has already thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend revision of hierarchical systems in favor of more horizon.</seg>
<seg id="49">``Before the bitcoin settles itself, it'll be a while, but 2013 can become a turning point, ''he predicts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy birth of the constitution of egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a risky move president mohammed morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While egypt divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him with emergency-style powers, he decided to play all-in.</seg>
<seg id="4">Catching everyone by surprise, he announced wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago, the head of state assembly two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon for two years, as egypt is based on preliminary text, in which several times amendment, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only reinforced the dissolution of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the president persists in his ``undeniably delirium ''continues to`` violate this word'' and ``trample on the right. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are convinced that it's a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within fifteen days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain the text, article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president is also a way to restore the society and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed морси, it seems, is convinced that the egyptians to vote positively, as he declared in an interview to the american weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, that the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the egyptian people: ``or you vote for my text, or i will keep emergency powers '', which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals not responded to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of november, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they hit the door, feeling unable to convey your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the brothers.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences day emerged around the time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that the constituent assembly were improperly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which went on yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of national attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical article from the constitution of 1971, purveyed that ``the principles of sharia are the main source of law. ''</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi party, which is the introduction of islamic law is one of the major requirements, hoped to replace the ``principles ''on`` rules'', which would allow them more strict application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For islamists, the fact that this article has not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">``Hypocrisy, ''the liberals who see it only as pr.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because they believe the islamization of the constitution passes through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular article 220, which grants al-azhar university advisory role, in particular with regard to verify compliance with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to a specialist in egypt sophie pommiers, this alarms, because ``people are designed to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. ''</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the emergence of a theocracy. ''</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, in addition, excited by the fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">``There are currently no specific religious intervention.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who worked on this text is not religious, and people with university education, some were trained in the french system ''- comforting alexis блое, which is preparing a thesis on egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that ``around article 220 may arise ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular ``fiqh ''[islamic jurisprudence is red.</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may wonder how civilian judges are competent to decide about it. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to their religious aspect, text approved yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The muslim brotherhood claim that they have declined substantially compared with what were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be in parliament, and in the national council defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also not barred from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite appeals to associations for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed concern over the text, which they claim to be devastating for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now prohibited insult, which could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles are not talking about the protection of women, emphasizes хеба мораеф from human rights watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">She said that the only positive moment is prohibition of torture in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word which does not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the egyptian president was going to last night on television and protests are planned today in the second half of the day.</seg>

<seg id="2">While the deputies and human rights defenders argue that will give the law on mandatory language testing, in the country have already appeared crooks, trade ``fake ''certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year to moscow, st petersburg and other cities of russia come 13 million migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most part are the citizens of the central asia: uzbekistan, tajikistan, turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since december 1, has entered into force of law, according to which every migrant would have to take the exam on knowledge of the russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">Until this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, ''promised in the federal migration service,'' tests will be obligatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">While the exam will not only language, but also the history of russian and basis of legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to obtain, and for the extension of work permits.</seg>
<seg id="11">An exception is valid only for the citizens of the countries where russian is the state language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Do not fall under the law and the people who have obtained certificates and diplomas about education before the collapse of the ussr in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits are doomed and protection of human rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A network of examination points will work under the auspices of the institute of the russian language the pushkin, peoples friendship university, moscow state university, saint-petersburg state university and other russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in russia opened more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of a testing supported and the state duma deputies, and the fms.</seg>
<seg id="17">But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times raised in the press question: what is, in fact, will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the indispensable knowledge of the language and for the russians, and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, a responsible representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people suffering from ``labor slavery ''.</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many people say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the fms of russia in tajikistan victor себелев.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protection of their rights should start to their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only system organization set allows for 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems arise from migrants without occupation, education, not knowing language, not having a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, ''he said себелев, is a future migrant doomed to face unfair people under the guise of assistance to put him ``are'' in a terribly close barack, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, giving 12 to 14 hours per day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">``At home they promise one thing, and on arrival they deceive, select the passport, are not paid a salary, ''confirms the head of the main department of labour migration ms tajikistan толиб sharipov.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Do not swear, the насяльника!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, many citizens of central asian republics, those who assemble to work in russia, admit that they do not know the language of a country in which seek to, but also own writes with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it's not so much on their fault, how much trouble: few turkmen, uzbekistan, tajikistan can afford to get even usefully primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because their families can not even feed children, not to mention to tame them wear, wear and equipment in school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Graduate to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of language, they confess.</seg>
<seg id="33">``You feel humiliated and inadequate. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in respect of the law on language for human rights defenders note this is an important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the same status is not present, there will be no exam, nor the last official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, a big part of migrant workers still reside in russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">``Welcome, or no trespassing ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors claim that receive an official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is bureaucratic barriers and the same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And that's a fake registration can be done quickly and for only $1500.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">``Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea, ''shared with journalists a citizen of tajikistan umed хушкадамов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">``Come on, do not be stingy, buy painting</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that fakes are not only migrants' documents for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">A few ``sham ''certificates of completion of a linguistic tests have already seized by the fms.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fake paper printed on the usual color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they got the new owners not for nothing: each of migrants надеявшихся thus facilitate that passing tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It's more than two times the price of the official test: it will cost labor migrants in three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the fact that the main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption to ``brown ''was not just buy, meet and state officials, and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the meantime, the government may promise guest workers, not managed to successfully pass testing with the first time, the time to examine basic language courses.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days in america wave of protests against low salaries at the corporation walmart and popular restaurants networks of fast food, such as at mcdonald's, burger king, ''``taco bell,'' уэндис ''and`` kentucky kfc.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">While no one undertakes to predict, will become whether this surge in the ninth wave or it is destined breathed in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Shares support unions and a number of the left of public organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from raising modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of walmart and system of fast food, the organizers of protests in a creation of trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Until this sector of economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Shares began last week after thanksgiving, in the so-called ``black friday '', when america has had an orgy of cheap sales, millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by a.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day, some employees of walmart, in which around the world employs 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle incomes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from the cradle, shotguns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores at an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">However many underpaid employees of walmart come only at their work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Availability and goods made walmart, one of the largest corporate america.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, walmart can afford to sell the goods off on the cheap partly because few pays its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, for example, on the shortage of trucks or handheld scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the shares in the ``black friday ''required to increase wages and lamented the fact that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to $100 a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">The average worker walmart, which of 9.5 dollars per hour, this consumption can not afford, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers at the university of california at berkeley argue that if walmart increases среднуюю wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If walmart, entirely shift wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store will cost them only on 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of walmart quite note that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not inflict corporation nor малейщего damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">``Black friday ''continued in its stores with 8 p.&space;m. on thursday before midnight on the next day, and during that time walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its cash registers produced in the ``black friday ''almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the corporation dan фогелман argued in an interview with the left site yesterday that jobs left a total of ``less than five employees of walmart, and that the protest was simply`` deadline-driven public-relations gimmick ''of its trade union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">``Free banking! ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued on this week in new york, where they were not walmart stores (in this progressive city do not like, and therefore them here yet), and ``mcdonald'ses ''and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Mcdonald's says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you the hospital and will not pay you for an honest job!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumeirah williams, a member of the new york city council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and new york law, is 7,25 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants with time, increasing it, but not much, and their average rank-and-file workers receive in new york $8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than them in this expensive city not earns no one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As you can exist in new york for the money for me insane.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through ``mcdonald'ses ''was almost a quarter of american teenagers, who volunteers for their position after school at the same time with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw it in this primary source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now i am constantly in an interview with workers, ''mcdonald, who have complained that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed on her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, at the forum in the wall street journal hangs a comment, the author which notes that irresponsible kids, if you do not know what you will be fed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests that began at 6:30 a.&space;m. on thursday of mcdonald's for the 40th street and madison, demanded that cashiers and cook system of fast food began to pay at least $15 per hour, there are more than doubled their current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were created by trade union organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits administration that prevent and punish trade unionists picky and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives.</seg>
<seg id="43">But it is difficult to reach the union fast food and objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main - unusual turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The dissenters</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place in this day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action appeared in the middle of the day rally of mcdonald's near times square, which was attended by several local politicians, in particular, a member of the city council jumeirah williams, who said: ``mcdonald's ''says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you the hospital and will not pay you for an honest job!''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators support and other prominent new york democrats, for example, the candidate of the city mayor bill de бласио, declaring that ``we must join together in support of the workers of fast food so that they have achieved fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new yorker! ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described on the new york times, it was the largest share of its kind in american history of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But in her participated only a few hundred people, though not all of them were workers rapid catering, in which the new york employs tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether that spark of the flame will generate a mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">``As long as it turns out to deceive brain medium</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technologies of the augmented reality in the last time to perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of the summer for their annual conference functioning model showed google, and then in november, it became known that the application for patent filed and microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, from the conversation with the head of the group of interactive using 3-d technologies in cambridge laboratory microsoft шарамом изади for scientists to this company glasses - in the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their nod prospect manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, to create a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">``Tell me please, in general terms, than doing your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">``We are engaged in human interaction with the machines, but at the same time, trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">While humanity in a mass stuck on stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes often banal in them with a finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years and predict drastic changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, xbox kinect sensors and is a step forward, and almost no xbox today without the kinect is not for sale, because all interesting gestures management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What else we ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">``Despite the fact that kinect underwent interaction on the physical layer, much still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3d.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of the data has improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change it, working on a true 3d systems display on the basis of different technologies, including project.</seg>
<seg id="15">We need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more palpable.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, need to recognize not only user, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">``What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is definitely not a panacea - the question arises privacy, because i do not always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in your niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the management of devices in public places we had in the project we thought over gestures, but not over sweeping, and over such, these short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not camera devices and handcuffs bracelet, which enshrines a movement of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While he's a big, but it can theoretically be to reduce the size of the wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But even the future for the hybrid type of control, for example, the жест+голос.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">``It's like?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, as you ask me to tell you that can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say and show at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">``I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">``Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">``I mean you want to force the users adapt to what may or may not be at this time machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">``It's not necessary, but that mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future we basically have to work on developing new types of sensors that allow accurately determine human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution depth, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">``If you are talking about your work with sensors xbox kinect, which you have a claim to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Do not have permission, depth or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In principle, the current generation - that's what i can make a start in our work over a three dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 building.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not in the megapixel, and as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the last point of view of all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work algorithm design.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we need to remember not only about the resolution on axes x and y and z.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The person is dynamic, and the current 30 building frankly is not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen бетишес from our redmond lab did the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between people and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would be in my work is very useful for the equivalent of such a device, not requiring touch to frames per second lots.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And the number of cameras do not need to increase?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">In the kinect now have three cameras, one of which was actually infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected the signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And that's already the third camera - is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">She does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analogue kinect, play with curved location cameras and see how it will help in 3-d definition provisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">``As far as i remember, microsoft, unlike google, not presented a public your glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You do not think that from the point of view of the everyday use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platform?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">``Of course, all the time on the road, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but that's what i think: the best option would be`` transition ''augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection screen and on everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points is a very personal device, in this their strength (privatization things only see you), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis points will not allow you to work on virtual objects with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- For a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air available not only to tony старку from ``iron man '', but also an ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, which often show critics of this idea: no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands do not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepares to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lectures i often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth may well become a supplement of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a background for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It's great to register pushing!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there is a technology, which is aimed at giving this ``pictures in the air ''tangible - for example, several ultraviolet rays in a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but until it is very weak - as if you came on the pad.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also the bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">``And you are trying to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To make him think that he feels that sort of should feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">``That's a good idea, we have not tried to do.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another task on which to fight for a long time - how to make a person, physically located in a very limited space to believe that he is an almost infinite - working over the concepts of jogging (not such as in the clubs), moving platforms as well as huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">Bye to deceive the brain at medium, work is still very for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes the work on a virtual reality so attractive for research - many things in its infancy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of the main control management: check schwarz-bart failed at the hands of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement, czech republic provides good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement, muiraslau kala, vice president of the supreme control, from an interview for the site aktuálně. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">``The law will never be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough, ''commented on the current situation stool.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusion provides joint inspection of the czech and german control bodies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices lead approach petra нечаса to so-called schwarz-bart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the prime minister declared that the gfc (civic democratic party) will not bother entrepreneurs - so it is forbidden or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">``The law should be in any way, and, if he's forbidden, and the prime minister can not resist the institutions, which are required to check and pursue obligations, ''stated kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the audit committee, in the chamber of deputies you talked about the joint project between czech and german side, within the framework of which it was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In parallel testing, we began, probably two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it's about the fact that a european law claims, how should receive government procurement, followed by national legislation and then another application in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All information was collected and, even if still unfinished inspection found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we could have ``accurate and unmistakable '', but in practice we are in certain parameters in germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, it is necessary to focus on the use of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But actually like this project can help you, that he does it mean for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This joint control can contribute to efforts to stop refining laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means getting appropriate things beyond a reasonable (but not always low) price, to avoid enrichment, and possibly criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we will achieve lower limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps, this system fulness ``papers ''that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if restriction does not decreased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You are talking about internal problems of the practical application of the law on state procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">And as a system of control in germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there such an organization as our kru (control), or is it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for institutions, then there as our crewe acts bundesliga, arranged in our principle, there are also colleagues working a little different, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because germany a federal structure, there are units of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in this system is somewhat different from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Brh can only control federal money, we dispose of public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities controlled at the level of federal accounting chamber.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for local laws, there would be easier than we have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In fact, i would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respect germany can be used as a sample, but you can not definitely say that it is better in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">So, because they are better able to control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, but then again, i do not like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we have to say that even exemplary country faces many challenges.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If you are talking about the domestic legislation, as the impact on your institution amendment of the public procurement, somehow manifest consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the validity of these amendments rather short, it still does not display in our works under control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we have to spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We take it into account only in the process of training of future audits - we have started to use our new tool detection non-economistsâ€ risk, ''through which we ran nearly 14,000 government contracts, we analyze them. there, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of pitches and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an additional strain on the system of the bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and i hope that it is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which may arise that rules ``tightening ''and they will not be observed.</seg>
<seg id="40">During the functioning of the previous control rules of the enterprise intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programmes - with the regional council) that any failure of the law on public procurement means a violation of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in this case, tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit a formal error, not affecting the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then how to get out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's realize that this path nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the prime minister said that gdp will not bother entrepreneurs inspections of the so-called schwarz-bart. what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">``Schwarz-bart ''is forbidden or permission?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be in any way, and, if he's forbidden, and the prime minister can not resist the work of the bodies, which are required to check and seek to fulfill their commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: ``we are going to switch this law and allow it, ''but you can not say that we will pretend that nothing happens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on state procurement contains quite strict rules and must formally take place, and that's a good thing. this protects the public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer disqualified because of formal deficiencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially it was my idea, then we are all concocting together with our artist гонзой augusto.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreover, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we would also like together with the public think about the condition of this world we once pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of may calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original key against the end of the world. these things can be bought at http: / / www. e-tap. cz and thereby at the same time to support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A group of the tap tap, together with other musicians also sang a hymn against the end of the world, which is called ``the end of the world is cancelled. ''</seg>
<seg id="16">It may sound like if already fancied listeners youtube anthem for these the concerts?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="17">Of course, the very end, if the result will be able to do and the end of the world does not come.</seg>
<seg id="18">Him sing all performers on all the concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hymns simultaneously ring also live czech tv.</seg>

<seg id="21">As you began to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other personae czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tried actively connect them to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that many people like to work with us, they wonder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What's going on revenue from the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the purchase of equipment for handicapped-accessible educational center studeo, for the sixth year we work with civil association tap at the institute of jedliczka.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly attend schools and students institute jedliczka spend them with joy and interesting events.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students have no money to go to teachers, and we tried thus give them the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework of the project of additional construction institute jedliczka in the future, a separate building, in which we can move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On every concert will perform several bands and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What were the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to make the program, which might be interested in all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in prague will perform chinasatcom, support lesbiens, illustrator with dan bart, the tap tap, marjan bango and jiří suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">All details can be found at http: / / www. kpks. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Whether you are planning any such ``grandiose event ''in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In may will first appear at the festival ``prague spring ''and then, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we'd love to a notion in the czech national house in new york, and i personally, if we will be in the united states, i would love to perform in washington and chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About overseas you are serious, you have already played in madrid, brussels, london and moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not so bad, as it may seem at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have got five participants on electric wheelchairs, their stroller should travel in the cargo hold of, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, handle it without problems. czech airlines čsa and british airlines british airways has always been great for us prepared that ceases to amaze me how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in moscow, where we have recently returned, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to participate abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards disabled people and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What did you experience to date?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After madrid, luxembourg, london and other countries, where everything works better than we have in russia, we have witnessed that in the east is still on a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared with the prague in moscow is a lot of barriers, and here is still in wonderment independent movement of the person on electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there not in such banal things as off the disabled in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there are public organizations, who are trying to draw the attention of people on the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in than the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improve the situation, always depend on those people who are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In london and madrid is normal that people with severe disability independently move on the streets, can go into the toilet, at the museum, anyplace.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in that we have them with the tap tap a bit ahead of!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for public or handicapped-accessible is one thing, but at the moment, when we will have known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really began to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Until this isolated cases - people with strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">A group of the tap tap is currently very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998 you made her organization?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the institute jedliczka as tutor, around me were a lot of young people who wanted to do something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And because i am a musician and play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized interesting music group.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, with time, says our lead ладя angelovič, it's a little out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity came only in recent years, or something i lie?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It's true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on a propaganda group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We conclude that the work that no one can appreciate, essentially like does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the european union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Whether you stood in front of goal so well turn the tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning i felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the business a lot of things, imitating one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but i dare say that tap tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression from a person who can see us, of course, the pity, it's natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But this pity is completely unnecessary because some people with disabilities are not some kind of sufferings and all abandoned personality, which we must regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live full lives and develop, of course, only on condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities get something, this shift not only for them, but also for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Whether the success of the fact that you are the strict supervisor, what you believe many?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the job, we should be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But i think it's okay.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic representation and fly in the clouds, and when they hear that twice a week they have to walk in rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very fast losing enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it is so in any group that wants to work and accomplish something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently in a group of the tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them was in the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one ладя angels.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are open group, people come and go, it would be impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have the desire and willpower, our door is always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on thursday nr at 21.00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will be held in prague on the stadium incheba in brno club - fléda and ostrava in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the czech republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">At the end of a concert of all three cities in the bridge at the moment of execution of the tap tap, ``the end of the world's off. ''</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at the meeting of ministers of the european space agency poland was accepted in 20 member of the european space agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern bloc (after the czech republic, which became a full-fledged member of the esa september 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with esa in 1994, and during the subsequent years took an active part in a number of projects agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the way to space, poland began earlier this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the second world war ii polish enthusiasts have flights into space, but it's not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to remind you, for example, about lectures. штернфельда, 6 december 1933 represented in the warsaw astronomical observatory of ideas from his pioneering work ``introduction in cosmonautics. ''</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (1905) left indifferent audience, after a few years штернфельд recalled that only dr jan gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in france штернфельд won prize robert эсно-пельтри and andre luiz хирша for ``introduction in cosmonautics. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. jan gadomski (1899 - 1966), about mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in the polish journalist hundreds of articles and wrote several books on this discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became world famous propagandist space exploration, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925, in poland was built a railway draisine, equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear even to disperse or to brake the cart was supposed to be used by a rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this draisine known only from the press of that epoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 polish artillery began to wonder about missile arrows.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study conducted by section technology weapons in cooperation with professors mieczysław вольфке and gustav мокжицким.</seg>
<seg id="18">From its historic materials, you can see that the study reached the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the advent of the german army work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of photovoltaic missiles, which offered engineer rogozin, and in the next year was the work of the ``air missiles and aircraft missiles ''author леливы-кживоблоцкого.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war over all projects military use rocket technology was a temporary scientific advisory committee (tymczasowo komitet@refugee (), which coordinated the job.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended due to start a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, dedicated to the space exploration, appeared in the polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the polish society astronomy (polskie towarzystwo astronomy).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the november issue of 1954 magazine ``problems '', which are published four bulky articles on astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, professor m. subotiv offered to organize society, which will be in charge of the cosmonauts.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time already gaining traction art project satellites, and it was clear that the space research: a viable industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the 1956 polish society astronomy (ooa) has sought to join the international federation of astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn ooa became the actual member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the following year, the first chairman of poá kazimierz заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the international federation of astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 ooa contributed to the development of highly successful meteorological missiles rm (rakieta meteor), which became the first polish missile, a scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on october 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">A missile capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently was built an enhanced version of the rm-1а, and in the summer of 1959 on bledow field test was conducted two-stage rocket rm-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">That rocket was at length about 1.4 metres, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the rocket was able to do this scientific work - a rocket rm-34 overcame 14.5 km, and her assignment was to monitor high wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, the further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The heir of the first missile type rm became a rocket meteor, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 years.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length of 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have developed three type (marked as meteor -1в and -1с), which are different size cameras for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket meteor had space of 0.4 l meteorological - 0.34 l and meteorological - 0,62л.</seg>
<seg id="42">A maximum range at all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in aviation institute was the development of missiles meteor, and her first flight tests started in october 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket meteor with the initial weight 380 kg was able to lead the payload weight of 10 kg at the height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then there were built versions of meteorology and meteorology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">You should also mention the membership in the committee on space research (cospar) in 1960, and establishing a national committee of the cospar two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, within the framework of the intercosmos, poland participated in the space research on the soviet artificial satellite, and in 1978 polish pilot mirosław hermaszewski became the second intercom after ремека vladimir.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decree has provoked a lively discussion in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">No doubt that it will be interesting to look at the problem with the wider point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal economic system in the eu, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that separate economic division, national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is connected with the principle of free trade, free and unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of a significant difference in cost of the labor force (wage) price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept you need to understand the manufacturer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition by the fact that ``intrigued ''cost competitor to take a larger part of the market, and thus increase own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a massive scale it means for the majority of entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labour, compared with other high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital bears no social responsibility, including for their unemployment, grow the inevitable government spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the economic and social damage inflicted by them in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that they do not need to give specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unceremoniously methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states of the situation, when governments are forced to join in competition with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the purpose of attraction in the country of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government to give its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected primarily in the changes of current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is economically get your ​​народ comply with the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool of slashing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of rising levels of poverty, and together with the difference between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In germany for several years already existing public distribution of products to the poor who are not able to feed themselves own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already approaching million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of raising the competitiveness of the german economy is constantly occurring cases when employed people receive that salary, that the state, it must be extra, so they could get a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional workers in the bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the eu, undoubtedly, lead to the same condition in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on the extremely low pay on the margins of society in the hope that one day in the country will come private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the question is, how does he do?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds will come from other eu countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, so as a chinese, indian, brazilian, turk, morocco, egyptian africa still works for a fraction of european wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to the entire latin america.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state can not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital obstinately insisted that the state should not interfere management actions in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Next, you should answer the question is whether private capital, now almost management policy and the whole state in our own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">A clear answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result we have a hopeless situation, emerging in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources to develop legislative private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills claims the bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, according to the constitution of the western type, but from financial groups who prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberal democracy now quickly turns into a ​​ситуации, as described in the appiani work, ``crisis of roman empire in the days of julius caesar and pompey '':`` the government has long been disintegrated, and agencies are involved in violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal receipt favours with the help of rocks and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the election with a previously sold voice ''... decent people do not for the post of government in the end, once the state for eight months left without consultation.'' seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for the choice of human energy. ''. appianus thought it would be pompey, but they became caesar that finally changed democracy in autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital has already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">So causes of fascist and communist regimes, we should seek in a reckless liberal economic system 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected to be the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Above all tragic fact that the current elite totally ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abolition of the law on public works is no solution, or at least not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and european level, the government of the czech republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus, this trend is a systematic character.</seg>
<seg id="49">The decision is the target of social and political reforms that will strengthen the fractional part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in a society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="21">Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 in 1871 led to developing a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason for the 33rd level пайком albert.</seg>
<seg id="22">The task of the first war was to disrupt the monarchical state in europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially in the uk, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than as a precondition for this kind of project) and the seizure of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Method, with the help of which has a team of the richest families headed by the rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - the order from chaos.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration (see the fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war through the killing of prince heir of the austro-hungarian throne ferdinand in sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial russia, beginning of the bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war ii ended in a sudden, unnecessary in military and economic surrender germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of tsarist russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing central powers, austria-hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing to germany huge war reparations, than a precondition to radicalise the impoverished masses, then remained only throw the germans strong enough, convicting the guilty and offering a simple solution leader, on a multinational czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, which is supposed to play, and i really played a function of the fifth column, stoking the fire of the war.</seg>

<seg id="28">In the late 19th century rothschilds provoked the foundation of the zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a jewish state, preferably in the history of judea from jerusalem as its capital (return in zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The balfour declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of jews in palestine, began to happen the first clash with the local arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">An outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to estimate, loose if hitler from fetters, in which it initially kept bankers, or what he did, it was planned in any case, the suffering of the european jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for recognition of the jewish state of the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like germany was triggered by military reparations for the first world war, the state of israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of the third war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers will manage to start, the jewish people, as in the second world war, become a victim of military actions in the front lines, now together with the arab or muslim population in the middle east.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of contention and chaos, not just within the country, but also at the international level (only take the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Whose fault, who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for a global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is important to distinguish the ordinary people of israel against their leaders, because we do and international bankers palm off people for a vote on election exclusively their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current prime minister of israel, a hawk netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers politician, keen to start a war with iran, which, through membership of iran, the shanghai cooperation organization (china, india, russia, pakistan...), will threaten progress in the global conflict, and given control of iran over hormuz, contains 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide), is also lead to the destruction of the global economy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">In what kind of light now manifest in the words uttered by david rockefeller in 1994: ``what we need is the general crisis, and the people of the new world order. ''</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, enjoy the comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world where every person was born the body at the birth of implanting chip, with whom he becomes a under a total control.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In november 1979 crowd islamist students captured the us embassy in tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the ousted shah mohammad reza pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the united states, which were the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the us administration, the positive outcome of the situation is not meant she could not afford to throw the shah overboard, because it is in the bud could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the liberation of hostages in iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was in no condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a hit at the prestige of the united states, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate caused a house wave of solidarity and anti-iranian sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in iran largely contributed to the defeat of jimmy carter in the presidential election in 1980, ended the election of ronald reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, my ford falcon coupe actor ben affleck operation ``argo ''describes one of the episodes of the story, which brought america small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the embassy of six workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence at the canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">The cia in cooperation with the canadian government managed to take them out of iran, at the same time, helped an extravagant legend cover, according to which they went on a canadian passport as members of the crew, looking in the country place for filming science-fiction epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented an expert on ``evacuation ''tony mendez, demanded that the cooperation of hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the legend was reliable, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, a fictitious production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation for a long time was kept in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of tony mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film affleck is a special combination of different genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">With one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called ``film '', the history of successful venture, scam is an example can be a number of films about friends ocean.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film constantly change the mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from tehran (credited shown trophy historic photos of events, and the way the same situation were demonstrated in the film, the large differences in this is not present).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, lighter-weight hollywood passages, criss-crossing with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scenes from the headquarters of the cia and other institutions - men in suits to discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations on the staircases institutions on the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben affleck has managed to do great resets career.</seg>
<seg id="24">The roasted actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">``The operation`` argo ''his third feature-length film, after dark detective ``gone baby gone'' (2007) and the thriller`` city ''(2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it was the first movie affleck, who is not starring in his hometown of the director's boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sense of atmosphere places at the same time, a quality elevated over early films directed by the hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And ben affleck is displayed in ``argo '', where tehran plays canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - introductory scene of the fall of the embassy of the impressive clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and unpredictable that arise when somewhere suddenly changes story.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect ben affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters on tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply a variety of exciting scenes of cinematic values.</seg>
<seg id="33">He's quite successfully work with this little things sometimes imagine there - it all comes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in america to prevent the looming crisis in the airport of tehran, and the rush on the runway look rather farfetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The lack of ``argo ''is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan arkin and john goodman in the role of hollywood colleagues is really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are in the film is not the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film affleck lacks a little drama, it's a movie, which can be viewed with the moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro re-creating thrillers seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, that's enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated ideas about the all-powerful and all-knowing special services.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules of the balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Portal www. bankovnipoplatky. com, annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce a competition for ``the most absurd decision or project from the eu. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">``We are what inspired by the recent events in which the eu plans to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major european companies, ''said`` right'' organizer questionnaire patrick нагер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among already put forward for the nomination of absurd - the recent decision of the european court of justice to unify the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Still, women had privileges on life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively are less vulnerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">``Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the eu people can advance the contest until the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place until the end of february 2013, ''he said нагер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Questionable orders of the eu, for example, compulsory and adding biocomplex in fuel, as a result of the damage to the nature, as well as the ban on using reliable mercury degrees only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or the directive on the amount of cells for chickens, resulting in this year has become the eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also criticized a de facto ban on the use of the term ``sandwich butter ''or withdrawing from the sale of classical bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Qualitative bananas must be 14 inches in length.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A pan-european apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in brussels usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the czech republic now even under the threat of the veto defends the requirements of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby: for example, bananas and top quality in the european union should reach 1.8m in 14 cm and did not dare to exercise ``abnormal curvature. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the european commission was justified by the fact that only harmonised existing scattered national rules, which are complicated by trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The eu, despite the resistance of some states still softened standards on fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to wasteful products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate for the win in the poll may become the last year's resolution of the eu, according to which sold balloons must necessarily contain warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The eu addressed the american research, in accordance with the balloons in the game are potential cause of death of children by means of suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">This restriction now applies for children under 14 years, which is prohibited to blow in foreign дуделки.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Fun ideas are born and home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Enough is absurd and rule on the european officials: everyone has the eu in any official position, it can not, given the sensitive topic for greece, use the name macedonia, and must instead say ``fyrom ''(the former yugoslav republic of macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Portal bankovnípoplatky. com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists ''principle of non-interference'' (laissez faire), offered for a vote, in addition to a number of the above absurd rules, for example, eu rules about the amount of food on the territory of the membership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The eu set the maximum amount of supplies of food, which could be kept on the territory of the czech republic on the day of its entry into the european union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently, the czech republic exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the questionnaire also interested and the idea of paying some countries for what they have no sea, and the idea to provide subsidies for the application for a subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have arisen in prague, and not in brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">``We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ask the european union for compensation, ''said the autumn of 2004, then minister of agriculture jaroslav palace (cssd).</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument he pointed out that in the country was a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional procurement state had full warehouses reserves, which it was necessary to remove.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that the czech republic is situated far from ports, the eu, according to palazuelos, it was supposed to pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a result, the european commission went towards the czech republic, ordered a tender for the purchase of grain from the countries which are landlocked.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages by the ministry of regional development, ministry of paul german (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies should have gone on filing for subsidies from brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Eu: bizarre orders are an exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the resolution, the member states can become criticism, the eu effort on regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the european union, according to many experts who deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A serious problem, according to experts, is a vase eu subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something in common with the deepening european integration, but which member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Causes emotions among czechs and that as in other eu countries, the czech republic must fight in brussels for the right to a specific identity of their traditional products, and she does not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the czechs after six years of fighting with the germans and austria retained the name of ``olomoucké syrečky, ''but`` туземский rum,'' tradition in our country, its roots in the 19th century, our producers were supposed to rename on туземак. ''</seg>
<seg id="36">Called rum may only be products from sugarcane distillate, and not out of sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products of the eu, along with the world-famous cheeses ``feta ''and`` gorgonzola'', marzipan from a german lubeck or parma ham, who have already been, for example, karlovy rusk, pogorzelska and třeboň carp and saaz hops.</seg>
<seg id="38">The trademark of the eu can be proud of pardubice carrot and hořice tubes.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want me to preserve the republic, but i am an amateur, ''said okamura.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind running for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I do not think about how to become senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we have in the country all function without problems, i am not running for.</seg>
<seg id="5">But i can not watch over the past 20 years the country, as here scurrying around thieves, people increase taxes and pension age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when i see something that i do not like, i am trying to find a solution like this to change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since i was 40 years old, and i am independent person, not to any party, i have no other way to influence things, but to run for the post as a senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the senate you hit, but soon went to the castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whether you are thus not turn back to people who you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I talked all the time that going in the struggle for presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">I later clarified that if i will be chosen by the senator, i will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a post office - it's a tool with which i will make their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">So i need the greatest influence and vast powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the difficulty is not only with the fact that we as a nation ропщем at myself in a bar or a television, but are willing to trample on anyone who tries to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this added media, which denigrated a person, and that confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, i am told that i give bribes from journalists, or that i was an adviser to jiri paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Move on to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The struggle for the presidential castle you have started with a thesis about material and criminal liability of politicians and return property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To this, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have as the president of such authority is not present, and only a senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">As you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When i am as a citizen lobbying that all excursions became free enterprise, it managed to advance.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is political - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he is deliberately thwarted, and it curbs citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent non-party man i have a much greater potential for assistance from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage in the fact that i, without the party layout in order, without regard to dogmas can take care of each party what is best for our country, and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you consider yourself a person, more relevant to the right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">With the czech point of view, it seems to me that i have attributed to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me is not important - a bit to the left or right.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is important for me, so we go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not about the fact that someone refers to the right, and some of the left, i want to unite people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I have always back any good for society decision, will offer if his hrcm or gfc, and i am similarly be against a bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You are angry when someone says you populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But if you do not prove that you say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for the company, you also have any ideal goals and views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that is what you have to try to approach.</seg>
<seg id="37">You can even call it a populism, but all proposals on which i say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that in politics, you will not hang on.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think when you exit to the people and talk with them, you will be able to implement and criminal liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to persuade politicians, journalists and public and try to poach them on their side, so we have succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="43">If i was elected president, i would not be any problem to organize a direct tv broadcasting, in which i shall refer to the heads of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they are in case of failure, will have to inform, why do not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality, which outline the abuse of, you could put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president - it was a tribute to public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I speak directly, that i am an amateur, and not a genius, and not an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies to assert their beliefs and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I am trying to promote themselves; in the case, if it fails, six years will be done and will be back in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is partly sounds like okamura should save the czech republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I is not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know, i will not do anything, so i visited a number of well-known people with a proposal to run in the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to the радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with the large amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also at least i supported the leading investigative journalist ian lorenzo, which opened fraud with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I ran because people really unsatisfactory, but now i feel at stake.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people do not go to elections, and most of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are independent in the senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people chose the senate so that the changes will be conducted with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, i will fight for their views, for example, for any direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the basis of their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought, because i have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential side, and i have no money on this.</seg>
<seg id="63">No money and the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You are talking about property declarations, and how your own affairs with this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Personal assets estimated at approximately 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have the plot in prague will cost approximately 25 million apartment at 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art by roughly 10 million, on астон-мартин 3.5 million and the škoda per million, and for a few million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally астон-мартин i got, because it was my boy dream - i always liked james bond, who drove the car was gallant with women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You are running on астон-мартине owns property to 60 million and you do not have any money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money separately in it do not want to invest.</seg>
<seg id="71">It's not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign i have already invested 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that i have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And i am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Spending on campaign i essentially covers senator salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But on the money i would not have survived, for example, could not pay son for english school, which costs $30,000 a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If i wanted only to earn some money, so anywhere would not ran.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So, you will be engaged in business, so you can live?</seg>
<seg id="81">You do not say that reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As i promised, its activity i partly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like to see that i was sts, which would keep the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But i just need to do something for a living.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">As much as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive a monthly basis?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From 200 to 400 thousand, i get further.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if i became president, his enterprise would finish.</seg>

<seg id="4">But i ask myself: why do we need today another library?</seg>
<seg id="5">All of them have internet, ipad and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is now no one voluntarily does not go to such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, unattractive bedroom town under the rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of richly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame maas of rotterdam, the bureau of architecture mvrdv, master bold any diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the problem with his usual calmness and appeared on the contest audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, cocky maas folded from its original gifts pyramid in size and completed a speech in defense of his project in the following words: ``dear citizens! ''</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's my suggestion: ``book mountain ''in spijkenisse, the so-called букенберг!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">She is part of a project revitalization, which also includes the underground garage, supermarket, mail, and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of november, ''book mountain'' was awarded with the second prize contest of the best library of the netherlands 2012.</seg>
<seg id="18">The plan also participates in the dutch national contest wooden structures in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, a featureless suburb, which could not offer anything except postmodern pedestrian zone, and surprisingly bad hall, white facades which suggests milk, became richer on one modern masterpiece of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important thing is in spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: knizhnoe eldorado covered for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">There's only one elevator in the center of a mountain array, because real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">Glass from all sides premise - a bright and easily foreseeable floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square.</seg>
<seg id="25">City environment recreating ideal.</seg>
<seg id="26">Opinion involuntarily seeks benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere - books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">``Usually bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually comfortless and impersonal, ''says blame maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We put a classic configuration space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner space of the book mountains skillfully used in the heart of the city, have offices, internet, chess club, ecological center and technical areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially compelling black bookshelves that serve as the finish of walls, the parapet, the staircase railing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their view, texture and unusual odor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated architects and engineers are lost in the roadway, what is the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">``We were eager to work with secondary materials, ''explains joop трауборст, project manager, representing the community of spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once at the same agricultural enterprise in friesland we met a suitable byproduct of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in greenhouses and the fields in the netherlands as a lining under the roots of artificial fiber materials mm thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">That's cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textile serves as a couple of seasons, after that he can throw it away.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library that fabric - for the first time in such amounts - was pressed in the thick four centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell of a little like a new car, and a bit of sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On top conduct 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who breaks the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in literary cafés not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch crockett and trees фикусами in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, and in the first turn of the right humidity on literary grief.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The costs of a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">``It is hard to believe, but this building, despite the multitude of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology, ''says троуборст.</seg>
<seg id="46">For his heating and cooling used the warmth of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although book mountain is the bell jar, even on clear days of the sun comes in just for a while.</seg>
<seg id="48">A wide range of farm from laminated wood, located in perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and assumes most of the sun's rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection fully automatic roller blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan sperm, aforesaid skeptic from the sphere of it, has visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette wehrheim also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as a teacher of traditional chinese medicine cynthia bogarde, which called букенберг ``soul spijkenisse, which has not enough. ''</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of every resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from the permanent collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were supposed to take the blank space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed the library at that moment in her was delivering books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea off.</seg>
<seg id="57">Shelves laden to the brim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">``There is nothing worse than half-empty library, ''says the architect blame maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">``I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it serves only as a decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus mvrdv managed to cope with the royal task, which is on the professional jargon called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And if they are very young and irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="65">It's only the starting point for construction of identity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Szabo: ``the germans should play an important role. ''</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to stephen szabo, an expert on relations between the united states and europe, in doing so, berlin is teetering on the narrow diplomatic track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche welle: at the beginning of the week germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of palestinians to obtain the observer status in the united nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen szabo: germany does not support israeli actions in gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now germany must be careful in connection with its special relations with israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, i believe that the american position she also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - and without speaking too critical against israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in libya in march 2011 germany also abstained on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, nato held this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is difficult to occupy a clear position on complex international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The point is that it is located in the process of transformation of his foreign policy, namely passes from policy, which, so to speak, run by the united states, the german foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the europeans have not accepted the uniform policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the germans are again between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that while they are just fumble their role, but are on the path toward a more ``normal ''foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, which conducts france or britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly means ``normal ''foreign policy with the german point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is the willingness to take in its national interest position, unaffected by the united states or european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the german foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.&space;e. from exports and ties with certain regions, such as russia, china, or the middle east.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of germany largely differ from the interests of other major states, and however germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About these economic interests on the position in the middle east conflict and to vote in the un?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, germany has major markets in the middle east, in particular in the persian gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">However she needs to be careful not to offend the public and elite in arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But i would not care too much importance, it's not entirely one-way connection.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Hurt whether germany to its relations with the united states, refraining in making important decisions, such as a vote of palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in europe and even in the united states dominated by the understanding of the german position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So i do not think that it was the same dramatic reed, as in the libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Possibly germany even acquires thus a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that with its interests should be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In europe, there are different opinions on the palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The united states, by contrast, clearly favours a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">If there are differences of opinion between the united states and many european states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In the force of the american domestic policy, such differences have always co-existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the obama administration in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly occupy such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that substantial disagreements are not so, as always seems to be.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between obama and prime minister netanyahu, you will notice that the obama administration is not thrilled about policy netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it easy for germany to combine their close ties with israel and the united states on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the eu with the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that's what makes a difficult situation for the germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the germans would be somewhat easier, if there is the creation of a consistent european policy, but now it's not.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can not act in the broader approach and must instead act just on the basis of their own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">That's how they come with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future of germany will take the lead role in the development of a common european stance.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that in germany, it's not easy, at least because of ties with israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This issue has always been so tacky.</seg>
<seg id="52">But i think the germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If germany itself sees himself in the role of important international player is not whether she's really the main character?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or a lead role still had a hard time making germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany had not used to it, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still always hard to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time germany assumes the role of a variety of anti-german feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The germans do not just deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Actually, it's an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this standpoint, germany is in much more difficult situation, than the united states.</seg>
<seg id="60">She should take into consideration the different neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the influence of the usa in european politics constantly lowered, but at this time, the eu does not fill the vacuum, then who remains?</seg>
<seg id="62">The germans will just have to play a more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or intense dislike of you - it's a fact of life!</seg>

<seg id="1">``Protection of the trademark in china: when puma and armani suddenly become chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is internationally famous trademark, polo ralph lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is armani polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is officially registered in china name that has nothing to do with companies, from which it is education.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original name sued.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then it is unclear whether they will defend their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">``Foreigners becoming to protect their trademarks in china, ''said thomas паттлох, taylor wessing lawyer company specializing in violations of trademarks in the far east.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Simulator to add a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">From gucci at lu-gucci, instead of prada you can register prada-kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">This way legally copied german enterprises, such as the manufacturer of sporting goods puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opens the folder паттлох with records agency trademark registration in beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On september 14, 2010, the chinese company registered there a trademark zegna df puma, artificial name, which also uses the name of the fashion house ermenegildo zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the chinese - world champions by copying and an infringement of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities have multi-storey stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">But matters паттлоха are not. on behalf of its clients he opposed to chinese enterprises completely officially received from the office of trademarks are the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The chinese call it ``ban ''минпай, marca-relli.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word associated with 'ban дакуань. ''</seg>
<seg id="19">So call women who prey for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The chinese authorities do not recognize the blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">``It damages the business with it, it is necessary to fight, ''паттлох convinced.</seg>
<seg id="22">``Trade mark erodes, a unique position is lost, the image suffered tremendously. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company by market research clsa, china, with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third on the size and the fastest-growing market for luxury items.</seg>
<seg id="25">But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks hard, and it is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tells about паттлох cases in which a court rejected claims, as the expiration of a long time to appeal the name has become the ``reality market. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a complainant is not lucky, he even will have to pay plagiarism, as damaged his trade mark in china, says паттлох.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, the company daimler lost legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery company sany, that shortly before acquired manufacturer goker putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company geely bought volvo originally used a blue / white logo, reminding bmw; and the process was successful, geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of fashion product lacoste lost in china simulator from hong kong and singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities do not feel guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">Department of the trademark registration ctmo in beijing confirms that, in 2010 due to lack of equipment and personnel premises there took place difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the past year there was a ``return from an emergency situation in the process to normal. ''</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the amount of untreated cases in the objections dropped by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">They closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the ministry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Fight this expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As very often in china, are impressive figures.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record and means that china in the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, according to the agency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was paid $1.8 billion yuan fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">In a simple, it means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Appeal against her worth many times, as shown in the case of the german family company freude.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group is fighting against the chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">The germans managed to achieve that illicit production of their fake auto parts was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the simulator for chinese rights on the trade mark freude.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was their own incompetence, as the names in germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the freude chemical familie in munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim of munich.</seg>
<seg id="54">Really, in both instances of the following freude won, but against the party continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to be alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question now is examined by the supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Вентцлер hopes to carry it on a good finish and praises the professionalism of the plane.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: ``the process of crumbling roads and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves. ''</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs hardly yield accounting, archive firms had to view even acts of a hundred years, to lead the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, freude inconclusively offered the other side of a six-figure sum in the euro ''for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">``This makes it clear how expensive it cost us, ''says вентцлер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The danger of the far east threaten to break even in europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Namely, in case if imitators register there for a vulnerable trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, a chinese manufacturer in germany wanted to register the name of freude for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">``We need to be vigilant, ''says вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="67">As he and his lawyer паттлох recommend german enterprises to be very careful with china.</seg>
<seg id="68">Not enough to rely on international position on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be ``everything in any way is worth defending, also in china, ''says вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if freude loses in the last act of his drama for a trade mark, it will be asked to pay a counterparty licensing fees for his own name, explains вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise, we are excluded from the market in the dark segment.</seg>

<seg id="37">Frequent viral stis are hiv, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic pediculosis and itchy refer to the parasite stis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main striking group?</seg>
<seg id="40">Gonorrhea and syphilis meet mostly by men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert koch institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in germany, the conveying occurs as a result of sex between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">Among heterosexual adults the commonest sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infection, trichomoniasis candidate (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of hiv among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new hiv infections in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the youth chlamydia infections occur significantly more likely than among other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have among young people are also common human papillomavirus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As changing the number of cases of infection?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The incidence of syphilis, according to the institute of robert koch, more than doubled with 1697 cases in 2001, before 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new hiv infections since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 was about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth lower than the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms point to an std?</seg>
<seg id="54">In infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints on urination separations, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as bubbles or seal.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">As you can protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but it does not provide a full protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Partly because the bacteria sexually transmitted diseases, can be spread by contact infections, and in close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">At early diagnosis can be cured by the majority of stis and avoid remote consequences.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">``Aids is an absolute taboo, ''says аннете lennart,`` because it is connected with sexuality.''</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusual for the country in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch black africa, the king mswati iii, is known for his love of self-indulgence.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such a state-sanctioned lifestyle also blame for the fact that the virus ич so quickly spread in the past years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But she is also for stray workers, which carry the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms have literally on every corner, says аннете lennart, ``but they almost do not use them.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture - flesh is flesh. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To support a bit of a cultural exchange, the choir ибмогни every two to three years travels through the south africa and sings the song, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern edge of black continent know since apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of whites, who sing song on the black language - such recognition does not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened induced tears in front of harsh border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">A trip always also leads in эситжени, where singers attend sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite the fact that the little village with difficulty can be found on a map in the valley of the river эцулвени she more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">``Go in эситжени, there light, ''say the people here.</seg>

<seg id="50">Our views in the universe: the key telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably, a telescope was invented in 1608, hans lippert - even before galileo galilei a year later began to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since the mirrors optical telescopes became increasingly available - and their opinion space deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">In the next 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope ''haleh'' at the palomar knot under the san diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror ''of the big south african telescope'' in south africa segment, for the sake of cost reduction.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tough countersignature under vertical angle - it limits his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">``Hobby-eberly telescope ''in texas also has a fixed vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its special feature: the high svetoslav ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world's largest telescope.</seg>

<seg id="10">Later, i stopped on a complex design ``an american of mexican descent. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here i was in mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional name and complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an american.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak well enough to ask questions or answer them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary is poorer than the native language, and i can not get rid of the american accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Because i pulled out his american passport and began to turn for the extranet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected mexican president enrique peña nieto visited the white house and met with president obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the usual meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The president of peña nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the mexican economy, whereby mexicans now, with the same success will be able to stay in mexico, instead, to move in the united states.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the united states and canada and create a north american trade bloc like the european union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the president of peña nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in mexico, but no specific proposals did not sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For mexico's relationship with the united states is heavy and full of old grudges question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most americans have never thought about that in the beginning of the year, the united states invaded mexico with shotguns and rifles forced its leaders to abandon the half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is only a statesman us mention any word criticism in the direction of mexico, in the press and among the elite mexican society was immediately given complaints that the americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And descendants of montezuma violent militancy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The most complicated relationships are mexico with more than 35 million americans of mexican descent living in the united states.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about insults?</seg>
<seg id="29">Them enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mexico have winners and losers, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and those for whom such capability is not present.</seg>
<seg id="31">In los angeles, las vegas, phoenix, denver or san antonio so many people of mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize himself in mexico and was forced to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Often it was a certain type of mexicans - the invasion of education, from poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In mexico, see it differently.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the american dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is american, and not mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination confusing and unclear, but we know what to believe their country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The united states of america.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Besides we know that the majority of representatives of mexican elites and the ruling class does not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder about humiliating defeat and treat us like a formof second-class status as an inauthentic mexico.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not talking in spanish, and our relations with mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them is explained by failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in mexico, they would not leave.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would not be now for the silk curtain, found in the us state life, but lost spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in guadalajara and legally moved in the united states, even in childhood, and it reminds me that between mexican americans and mexican descent, there are certain tensions - mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the americans of mexican descent is a shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She's the us citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my familiar americans of mexican descent do not feel belong to any one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the mexican group los tigres del norte, but love and bruce springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Receiving the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In mexico we americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the usa, we are called the mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as i discovered during my trip, like our relationship without enough muddled, some mexican leaders and representatives of intelligentsia want to rebuild relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want americans of mexican descent worked as a kind of ambassadors of mexico and represented its interests in the united states.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell your friends about what it's a great country and how great her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yeah, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">It does not work.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too much offense in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="59">I am sorry, but deal with themselves, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And rightly so.</seg>
<seg id="61">If part of mexicans still can not forgive the united states what they did with mexico and a half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some americans of mexican descent still complain for the way recently in mexico were treated with their families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more in common than i thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle on the new middle east</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas can become a fragile foundation for further world</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It might be a long-term peace between arabs and israelis in the middle east?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of the bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound traditional, senseless disputes about who started; lots of buildings reduced to rubble; killed more than 140 palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of israel's tel aviv and the holy city of jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the israelis and palestinians hopelessly entangled in his eternal conflict, the middle east came change.</seg>
<seg id="7">This can be treated differently, but the events of the ``arab spring ''dizzy in the rebellious storm of many established realities, and the palestinians with israel not managed to stay in the side of the vortex, amazing region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on november 21, will be performed on this week clash only strengthened the security forces on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the islamist movement hamas, which came to power in gaza in 2007, expressed from the fact that they forced israel to withdraw, despite the incurred loss.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that certain leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, israel has failed to destroy hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, hamas intensified its popularity in the west bank - another palestinian territory controlled by currently more moderate fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of hamas may well conclude that the time working for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the growth of the influence of islamist movements in the arab world, hamas appear new powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Resurgent regional leader of turkey, which was once the closest ally israel among the muslim world, performed with the support of hamas; it followed the example of qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the persian gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The victorious hamas supporters claim about creating around israel of the islamist movement - from lebanon in the north, in which government paramilitary group hezbollah, syria, in a pro-islamic rebels to overthrow the power of bashar assad, and further to jordan, where the government of the king is threatened by allies of hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern borders of israel, in the most populous and important arab country, in egypt, where president mohamed morsi has the impact of the muslim brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni mubarak, who ruled egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictatorship, not уделявшим special attention to the support of hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The muslim brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization, in many respects similar with hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populist.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomatic broke hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even israel and america.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the supporters of the ``hard ''line in israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the military sense hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">The israeli anti-missile system ``iron dome ''justified costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of started hamas missiles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the us remained faithful to his unchanging positions; many european countries also faulted for the beginning of the last round of violence on hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity in israel, especially with the government of binyamin netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the fact that from 2004, approximately 30 israelis were killed by rockets fired from gaza, israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by the wall that comes on the territory of the west bank - a significant part of the unrecognized palestinian state - and protects the jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of prime minister netanyahu, whose party likud is in preparation for scheduled for january 22 election teamed up with even more offensive minded conservatives led by avigdor lieberman's very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What's the point of pandering to the palestinians and give them their own country?</seg>
<seg id="33">If to give into the hands of all power in the territory of the west bank, not whether they will run out of missiles at israel, as it is done by their kin in gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It's better to keep them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise your head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, the supporters of the ``hard ''line victorious; but their calculations may be refuted the arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Despite the fact that islamists who come to power in egypt and other countries, are not very fond of israel, their priority will be internal problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Defense budget israel more than all of its arab neighbors, put together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of arab countries to strengthen our own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism president of egypt, morsi, who co-starred with barack obama worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of the change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, not least, should consider a long-term impact of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the democratic change in arab countries, deprived of the palestinian right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later will explode in the israeli occupied territories, like a bus exploded in tel aviv on this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression already undermines democratic order in the jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the arab population - only exacerbates these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">For the bloody operation, which is held every few years on the territory of gaza for the suppression of hamas, must pay the growing discontent with the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need outside momentum</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution that tirelessly calls sane representatives on both sides, but also a large part of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and concessions from israel in exchange for the safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, not too impressive in the short term, ''the hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries efficiently influence on the side of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which we have to make a decision to cut off supplies of weapons into gaza, as well as turkey and qatar have, as ever, advantageous position to convince hamas recognize the jewish state, taken in 1967, with the exchange of territories and the sharing of jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation between hamas and fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">That would make more for the creation of a palestinian state, than the vote in the un, the result of which can be a recognition of a palestinian state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Their role is to engage israel at the negotiating table, is expected to play and president obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the white house, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to a resolution of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">A disastrous short-sighted position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The united states of vital interest in stability in the middle east.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is possible only in the case of the peace agreement between israel and the palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In australia has entered into force of law on the unified packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the hazards of smoking and images of the disease of body parts contrasts allocated on damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in the world practice australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same box of sceptical colors with gruesome photographs of affected body parts and images of children, whose health smoking undermined by their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to different images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the bundle, introduced in a compulsory manner with this saturday - the name brands, which are printed on the fine print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of australia claims that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the bad habit of fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the heart of this decision on the results of research, showed that those who do not started smoking before 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">``It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning that is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of packaging, ''explains health minister tanya плиберсек, citing studies show that, for example, the crown in the logo of children with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adoption of such measures are already considering and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry hard against the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">``This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiative, ''said scott mcintyre, a spokesman for the british american tobacco in australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Manufacturers of counterfeit products from china and indonesia will supply a lot more of these goods for sale on the streets of australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone on the contrary, the new laws increase business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha from a small family company zico import pty ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as british american tobacco, the british imperial tobacco, philip morris and japan tobacco lost the case in the high court in australia, where he tried to appeal against the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to sandra ha, the company zico already implemented around six thousand products enterprises wholesale trade and expects the new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us it's a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A potential obstacle for the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among the right part of the population, in which direction these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the adoption in australia of several laws that have made illegal television advertising cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sell cigarettes in a visible place, advertising for tobacco has shifted to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The australian government banned local companies and websites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">``If you trade tobacco and you have only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods in the internet feels very tempting, ''says becky freeman, research questions of public health at the university of sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of alleged ordinary users, in such social networking sites like youtube, twitter and facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen who loves marlboro cigarettes, what did not spare time and energy and made a video, or behind this ad campaign?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Australian department of british american tobacco argues that in the industry is now more busy adaptation to new rules than advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of ukraine, honduras and dominican republic to contest the new rules: these state claims in the world trade organization, declaring that trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations all these countries with australia are poor.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision of the wto is expected by the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to tani плиберсек, the government has discussed with other countries of the possibility of adoption of similar laws on packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, the first canada imposed compulsory photos, warning about the hazards of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it's generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including brazil, turkey and ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of tightening laws are considered in the uk, new zealand, south africa and india.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in australia ostentatiously not obey innovation.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures me not graze.</seg>
<seg id="33">I just do not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">``Just snatched a cigarette and keeping pack in your pocket, ''explains viktor el haig, buying cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor mouth on a stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, the only thing that can make me leave - this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James йу, head shop tobacco king of the pack in the heart of sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task ordering goods on shelves</seg>
<seg id="37">``Before i got the unloading of a new party left an hour, and now four hours, ''he complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">``The government needed to take and ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, okay, it's over, locking down the store, ''he says, raising his hands up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Miss in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection is not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this thanksgiving, i suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our aircraft were found a mechanical malfunction and be replaced by another plane, which we are pending.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, i have had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight - it's really boring, and it's not much to help no books or magazines, nor the iphone, nor even duty-free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But lately it's more scientists and experts on child development argue in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and our children will miss not so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain to focus on interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And since the modern world, we are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we should strive for boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will come back to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before i, like many others, thought that bore - the invention of relatively recent times, when people have appeared more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is not so, says peter tui, a professor of greek and roman history of the canadian university of calgary, the author of ``fascinating history boredom ''(boredom: a lively history, yale university press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">``Actually bore boasts a very ancient history, ''he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in pompeii discovered latin inscription about boredom, dating back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This remains an open question, as we understand boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, says john d. eastwood, an associate professor at the university of york in ontario, canada, understanding and vision of boredom often changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">By studying the research materials on this topic and set the target group in 100 people, a professor of eastwood and his colleagues came to the next definition: boredom is when people want, but can not do anything to bring them to satisfaction. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, is that people do not bored doing something that i would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy nothing to do not want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The present boredom, ''he says, ``it's a violation of attention and associated with this deterioration in sentiment and a feeling that time goes slow.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, professor eastwood argues that despite a possible connection between these conditions, miss people see causes of the problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when in fact, we would be hard to focus on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study ``unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, ''published in september issue of the journal perspectives on psychological science, professor of eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the tv shows-commercials included in the next room, others heard these sounds at a low volume, so that they hardly could understand, and a third group only listened to a recording of the voice without any sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard tv with a low volume, noted that they were bored, are more likely than others - they found it difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons behind it, and attributed it to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption coverage can cause weariness, ''says mark j. фенске, an associate professor of neurology at the university of guelphs, ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, ``for example, peering into the flow of the products in the line in the search for marriage deflects music can help avoid boredom. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">As he continues, that when people start swaying on a chair or paint scribbled on a sheet of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that the fact that such action just helps not relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">``The study found that children who do not forbid fidget and twisting, learn better and more information than children, from which require sit tight, ''said professor фенске.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In any moments we are all feeling of boredom: in the event of a delay in flight (as in my case), listening to drone on browsing the uninteresting kind film.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers developed a special ``scale propensity for boredom. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For valuation on such a scale used questions and, for example, ``a lot from the fact that i have to do, monotonous and dull ''or`` i am too much interesting, so no matter what does not have enough time.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such research determined that the boys miss often girls, ''said stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the university of western florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, the general teenagers do often bored.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, reed larson, a professor of personal and social development at the university of illinois, conducted the experiment, during which he contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32% of adolescents announced that they get bored at school and during the implementation of the homework, and 23% reported that they get bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">While only 3% of parents noted that they get bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor larson notes that he has no data about what would have been similar data about boredom, now 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, he knows that ``the adolescent peak propensity for boredom '', largely because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully solve than sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back to my original question: boredom useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in the margins of it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in an effort to relieve boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says professor воданович dedicated study this problem more than two decades.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="50">If you are going to be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make myself.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">It is unclear how to apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony orozco, the nineteen-year player of the football team and community college students in the southeast colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, essentially, they are going to be quite legitimately throughout the state: a small portion of marijuana and a tube, in which he smoked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr orozco says that one day in september he was with friends in ламаре and driving in the car on the prairie near the border with kansas, when they had been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a police officer discovered in the car marijuana, mr orozco came a summons for possession of drugs and possession of a device for drug - misdemeanors, for each of which are due to a fine of $100 - and date of the court session.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">``With us treated as criminals, ''says mr orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But crime if he?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of uncertainty, which have persisted for several weeks after the colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of the hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law, as on the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already filmed in hundreds of cases, and here in washington state, which adopted a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped indicted people at the age of 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be seen as legitimate, once in a couple of weeks of the law will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, in a conservative districts of colorado prosecutors decided to examine existing matters associated with marijuana, and still attract to account for possession of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, in some cities from suburban denver to the mountains of the west to vote for it to prevent the emergence in their new places, licensed state stores for the sale of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">``It is growing so fast that i do not even know what to expect further, ''said daniel j. oates, the chief of police in the town of aurora in the east of denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the regulatory authorities in washington state, also puzzled scratch your head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are to form the rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all you need to do before december 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In colorado over an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example, ''explains brian e. smith, a representative of the council on the regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in washington state.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can do more, admits mr smith than put forward any proposals and hope that it would work.</seg>
<seg id="18">``We have no real precedent, on which we could navigate, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Bill washington state i-502 called, will enter into force on december 6, and the whole year plunging state in the state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing still present, and the ownership of marijuana is legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are still difficult technical aspects, which must be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state about ``adequate access ''to your licensed marijuana from a ban on trade it within 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">``It's particularly difficult to place licensed vendors marijuana in the inner cities, in particular in seattle, and its suburbs, ''explains ben livingston, a representative of the newly established research group center for the legalization of marijuana.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On november 21, the police chief oates from aurora pitched his subordinates from an e-mail message that city prosecutors will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police stops уличать people in these violations since this moment. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Police chief oates said that the police will monitor the compliance in the city of rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The district attorney weld on the north of colorado, ken buck, represents a strict approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote of the draft bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to bring to trial for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its use of a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment of 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused in other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">``The duty of our institution to persecute for actions that are considered crimes in the time they were committed, ''said mr buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was mixed even in places like rural district mesa, where the voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in grand junction, the country's largest city in the county, no longer attracts the responsible adult for possession of a small amount of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="30">The district attorney pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to shoot charges on already open cases connected with the storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">``I believe that enforce the law until he will not change our direct duty, ''he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55 percent of residents of colorado, participated in the ballot supported that decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the confused reaction residents in various locations around the state has revealed the ambiguity relations between the local authorities to participate in the state with marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">``The prosecution in this regard, there is a cultural barrier, ''explains sean mccallister, denver, a lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the national organization for reform laws on marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">``They are so long persecuted people for it, that it can not really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime, ''he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and washington - the first states in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the scope of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalisation and state officials plan to expand the territory of the legalization of trade, but at the same time, they fear waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Supporters of legalizing marijuana hope that the department of justice to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several have received wide resonance arrests of traders and patients, using marijuana for medical indications, the federal government in most cases were approved on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in colorado, washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Agents of the bureau of narcotics are unlikely to be at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become a blind eye on regulated state authorities shops recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, ''said kevin a. sabet, a former adviser in the struggle with drugs in the obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some cities in colorado were not wait for the actions of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on opening new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so could not open sooner than a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, montrose, city in the western part of the state, nominated for the consideration of the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">``We do not want to be in a position that we will issue someone license, and then it would cause serious problems at the federal level, ''says bob nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we have a clear contradiction between the results of the local voting and voted for that state.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is still a lot of unresolved issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella уайэтт: i survived from oxford for the fact that i am a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">How much i can remember, i have always wanted to do to oxford university.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and brother went to oxford and described him as the best in the world institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, the two foundations of civilization, freedom and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of training on the history department of worcester college, oxford university in the late eighties, i packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father could not endure and cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The evening standard argued that i dropped out of college, because i do not like what my fellow students have sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer, e. e. norman wilson joked that i left because i had to drink from shcherbatykh cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In fact, it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, she ran off, because i systematically hounded and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not because of my pretty unusual name or the fact that i attended a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was the only reason, and in this renowned cradle of the light it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late woodrow уайэтт, was a famous advisor margaret thatcher, and i was on the side of the conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask why to reminisce about this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, follows centre-right views, is the same harassment.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institute and constantly growing hatred of students at oxford is so strong that last week, a group of these students demanded the same protection of their rights, as the one that is available for the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservatives from the students' club in corpus christi college in cambridge, claiming that their ``often actively isolated expose personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests ''because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to enter in the committee on equal rights of college alternate representative, to ensure freedom of expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation only exacerbated recently released on the bbc 2 documentary about politics in the country of miracles: young, smart and right, ''in which conservative eccentric and neo-nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the film was shown joe cooke, a former president of the association of conservatives at oxford university, who travels in rolls-royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with silver bedknobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other university students complain that they make ``scapegoats to an increase in school fees. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the association of conservative nottingham university, in an interview with one of the sunday newspapers, said, ``at a university increases skew toward the left.</seg>
<seg id="24">People that we do not even know in advance to be bold and with impunity of lush children of rich parents. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel roberts, 21, a student of history faculty college in corpus christi, which was filed a petition on strengthening the protection, calls this atmosphere of ``uncomfortable '', and stephanie черилл, 19 years, the new president of the association of conservatives at oxford university, says that the ratio of members of the student club to the centre-right views dramatically worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">``This represents a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for normal life club members, ''she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks in oxford, i was not just in the minority, i was alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">I got there in september 1986, timid and shy 18-year-old girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford fever from hatred of the conservative party.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year before this university vote deprived former student of margaret thatcher of her honorary degree because of budget cuts on higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even stalin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week freshman, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time i felt that what awaited me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I did not know that teachers do not only a blind eye to badger students, but also gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political questions - the miners' strike, privatization and discontent of the government of sanctions against the government of apartheid in south africa - seeped through trimmed with wood panelling wall audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first seminar i needed to translate french text of the eighteenth century in english, and i was not ready for the fact that followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">``Miss уайэтт, ''said a teacher, the late harry pitt,'' please put the first paragraph. ''</seg>
<seg id="37">The text gave me with difficulty, i hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry pitt was very bitter man with the face like a cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">``Thatcher did not fundamentally taught french or they just did not have enough brains? ''he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students laugh.</seg>
<seg id="41">I have in front of tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">``Suggest you take a few primary lessons of the french in his spare time, if you are, of course, it is not very busy, rotating in society, ''пробрюзжал pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I am back in your room is miserable.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the evening in college, i sat at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was james, second-year student in the english language, who introduced himself as a member of the association of conservative university.</seg>
<seg id="46">``I know who you are, ''he said kindly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> ``Unfortunately, the law is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Over every, who is suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives, will be scoffing.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can not be easy, and in your case, they know that your father close to margaret thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majority of first-class pretend that they are labour. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, at the local pub, i am too cowardly to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that it did not agree with everything, says margaret thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freshman of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who studied at eton, said: ``you are the daughter of a fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contagious. ''</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was flawed, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">``As conservatives have sex? ''asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> ``They beat each other, right? ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like, must have felt homosexuals before the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">If i can ever live a normal life in oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or i will have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">If i am going to be forced to become labour and hide their real persuasion?</seg>
<seg id="64">I three years has come to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, not hide their conservative views, was norman stone, a professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to thatcher on foreign policy issues and one of its speechwriters.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he has not returned.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the marxist view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship in post, bilkent university, ankara, turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">``Here you would not be happy, ''he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I travelled to oxford from the parental home in london, trying to find a refuge among relatives and impartial metropolitan friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that i hate oxford and explanation.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in the forties there were any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">``But it's the best university in the world, ''he said plaintively.</seg>
<seg id="76"> ``There is not capable, only not in the city of dreaming spires.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends always behaved impeccably. ''</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes blurred.</seg>
<seg id="79">``Do not take any hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure it's just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You crush my heart, if you drop university. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was exhausted regular trips to london and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also conservative, could not bear the pressure and abandoned its belief.</seg>
<seg id="84">Next week during the seminar, when the history teacher completely serious called me ``the enemy of the people, ''i decided to do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the shower burning from shame, i confess that i had brainwashed parents, ''and called them ``old fools.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Reprieve was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin of my career in oxford was destined to score my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time, he wrote every week for two columns for publications owned by rupert murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I did not appear, and after five minutes my haunting surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, i packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to london.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never came back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me плаксой and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in eighteen years no one should not become a target of this anger and intimidation in educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="95">The sad that it was oxford, which is not only released fourteen tory prime ministers, but also to this day behind the undeserved reputation university, in which value equality and freedom.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most challenging profession in the world: miners with кавах-иджена</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euro indonesian miners are risking their lives and health, it was 70 kilograms of sulfur on the top of the steep rocky road</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for which their job is hell, but other literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them анто widjaja, one of the 400 miners who earn a living prey sulfur in the vulcan кавах-иджен, located on the east of the indonesian island of java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day анто descend into the very bottom of the crater, where sulphur dioxide gas, rising from the depths of the earth, freezes in contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Breakaway huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which may reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, baskets piled on the shoulders and carries them up the precipitous rocky road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, and the height is 2.386 meters, only 250 metres, but weary movers require more than 40 minutes to get a snail's pace, with difficulty restraining balance and carefully fumble road, not to fail and not fall off a cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong move could cost of their lives, as it happened with one tourists from france, which slipped a few years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 cents for every additional kilogram of sulphur mined</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, they pave a road between tourists who photographed them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy crates, march three kilometers before weights mining company is slightly higher at an altitude of 1.850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are talking about the pt kandy нгримби enterprises, which operates since 1960 this volcano, and better and not to say their employees, which it pays 662 indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical production, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamic and even for the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">``As the norm is papoose 70 kilograms, we generate about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every ходку, ''explains us анто, which usually carries out three daily carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels crushed, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euro) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems to be мизером for such a tremendous effort, it is three times as much that he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">``Daily fee miners is very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average wages is equal to two million rupees (167 euros), ''explains stevedore, who previously worked as a bricklayer in tourist island of bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the plot was not so hard, but анто returned with his family in баньюванги, town not far from the volcano, had good reason, which in indonesia is the same shattering, as sylph: ``i married a girl with the bali, where some hindus, and brought her to java, she had converted to islam. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The анто asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and have it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In my 27 years анто spent three years, the risk of a кавах-иджене, sulfur which has already started to reverberate despite the availability of masks and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and have it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases, which selects the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">``Work for another two years, because i want to open a shop or explore the french or spanish, ''he promises on more than acceptable english.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or bellhop in hotel, but instead he performs the mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">I share the dirty wooden hut with the other, he rises every day at 2am, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and shiny among the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, the анто descends to the crater, highlighting the small lantern, connected to his helmet, which he bought himself with your money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters drag basket with gray hair on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite the high levels of profit mining company not mechanized the extraction sulphur for savings and does not provide any equipment porter, who work on his own account, and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they do not even get part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for shooting, which, along with the input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve is charged with tourists who come to snap a picture of a volcano and his men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">``This work for cattle, and not for people, ''says бадрусин, stocky summited 42 years, which spent on кавах-иджене three decades, since i left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">The ability to raise up to 110 pounds, he argues, will tolerate job ``for as long as it can, ''because he needs the money for education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense pillars of smoke, out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains on my heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, arthrosis, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which deforms under the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing a basket on the back, now only унайник can raise 50 kilogram in their 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three cargo at a warehouse in taman, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow path in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="35">``I do not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life, ''says унайник, widely opening your mouth, which lacks a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">From his five children, senior, 30 years, also works carrier of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what human mules with кавах-иджена.</seg>

<seg id="10">It's a major problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world for the continuation of their own kind, so we felt that this is the subject of which we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government has a lot of things to do, for example, launch spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (quick message form).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily work.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who do not take it so recklessly, so it's the government of singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is spending $1,300 a year on the policy of enthusiasm for citizens to the birth of a greater number of children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The package for couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging maternity leave and provides tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it has a low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech state in southeast asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his stern public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birthrate in singapore, in accordance with its national management by population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time he was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why singaporeans do not have a greater number of children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang wei ming, director of the policy for couples and families of the population, says that the reason for this ``improved education ''and`` a wide range of career opportunities.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">``It enabled people to have a wide range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of the family, ''she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes of social norms boosted the number of bachelor and postponing marriage and birth of her children, resulting in reduced fertility rates in singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront a reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In singapore has web sites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in relation to many new immigrants, particularly chinese, which is criticized for the maintenance of wages at a low level, and reluctance to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration is also considered as one reason that in the past year, the ruling party singapore got the worst result in elections since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election was an attempt to solve the problem with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The unintended consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While falling fertility has known effects on economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, it is an example of singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government strives to not has been so much of a small housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Guidance on urban development has been transferred to the control of the number of apartments, known as the ``shoe box ''that can be built in certain areas of the city.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">But lim yu sun, the director general of the construction firm el developers said they ``boxes of shoes ''sold much faster than larger ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular in the sense that such apartments sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash flow is increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he concedes that new rules give clearer guidance for developers, which before were hurdles if they wanted to offer too many apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too redirect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">While these new rules can be a step toward increasing national fertility, after his conversation with singapore, which operate in the fiscal quarter center, it seems that they will not have a special effect.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">``People are very overstretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of that many people it delay, ''says a young manager.</seg>

<seg id="15">``It affects the health of any person, ''he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa pointed out that the solution, granted assange asylum from june in the ecuadorian embassy in london, through the provision of guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to go in ecuador, lies in the hands of the uk, sweden, and european courts and stressed that talks were in london about finding a solution to the confines of the founder of wikileaks.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to retain veto of paraguay in the unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization should be solid and not tolerate opportunism and support under the guise of legality, ''because in reality,'' it shattered the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The ecuadorian president considers, in addition, a ``perfectly reasonable ''desire for his colleagues at columbia juan manuel santos to conduct negotiations with nicaragua on maritime boundary between the two countries after a decision by the international court of justice in the hague, which turned out to be in favor of nicaragua maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment this decision is not observed.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Deaths from aids today is the result of the late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that its analysis on aids gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">``I am like you are frozen, ''he recalls the rough, despite all the time with a doctor, the moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man kept it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn about her as much as possible, and his efforts were fulfilled: he mentioned his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio is one of the ``elders ''patients hiv-negative hospital hospital civil de guadalajara (hcg), where he appeared in 1994, overcame many hurdles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with the diagnosis of ``the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) for 22 years. in the early 90s it would be hard to believe - too little existed treatment options, too little known about the disease, too biased attitude to the sick.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of the mexican institute for social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, ''because he had cut.''</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those days have aids was sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with hlhs and do it without aggravating the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when a virus already damaged, ''drained their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of aids in the world, at least after the first notified cases, ''is a great achievement at this time is that the survival of the patient, which starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same,'' said the head of the hiv-negative hcg, jaime andrade villanueva, citing the fact that this information confirms in april this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infection and expert on hiv / aids, andrade villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that aids is not a sentence, however duration and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy of those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 cd4, and up to 50 years, when informed about 500 cd4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that whoever gets diagnosed with hiv at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, ''support control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,'' he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To evaluate this progress, we should remember that life expectancy mexicans today in an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in case of mexico, the number of people dying from aids fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report from unaids), it is also true that since the onset of aids, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in jalisco 255 people have died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by may this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> ``Why are you still have a lethal outcome?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Personally i think that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So i can imagine, so in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the past 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know about their hiv status, i.&space;e., the later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He brought devastating data: ``nine out of ten patients come when you already have some opportunistic infections; that you should do to exert greater influence on the overall mortality, so it's diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide an audition for detection in a massive scale, for all people, that it will be asked. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal opined experts and officials of the state council on the prevention of aids in jalisco (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like fabrizio, who turned to check into a private lab, motivated by only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of aids and even suffered kaposi's sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">All changes when you know that you have aids.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some people think to die, and do not want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">``Once all anyway, i will drink hard three times a week, ''they say, but not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, i am eating well, doing exercises, taking drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">``I work, i have a lot of lessons, i travel, i keep sexually active, but with the mutual responsibility, take care of myself and about the other person, ''listed fabrizio, who agreed to share your personal life with milenio jalisco, to prompt by those who now, in the context of the world aids day, is experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let them check if it was the risk of infection, as soon as possible to know whether they are hiv-positive, it's better, and if they have already got the diagnosis, let him know that they can live like any other man, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's his message summarises the fight against aids in this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Large gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, ''said ricardo salazar, a journalist from guadalajara, which went into the problem with hiv.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the places on this task, ''actually increased condom distribution, before they gave us one or two, now give us packages on guard, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still does not have access to condoms,'' he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">``Why do you? ''is a popular issue with ехидством and conviction, on the side of social workers, school consultants, employees, pharmacies and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured propagandist.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this inefficient allocation; that condoms were not only for position and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that frequently visits the youth.</seg>
<seg id="40">It's not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor of emilio gonzalez, when he was asked that the distribution of condoms in its leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">``It's not sexy, best make condoms available to those who engage in sexual activity, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key data in jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Registered (13,435 summary cases 12,158 aids and 1,317 hiv).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state ranks 4th in national ranking in new and total cases of aids and the 13th on hiv.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of infections related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% by perinatal path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">An estimated 50,000 people can live with hiv, as the one known case from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.</seg>
