<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican strategy of resistance to the election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified their policy necessity of combating spin in the election.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in the centre of Brennan believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from stroke of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Besides the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing we can say with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why most state governments from 2009 pass laws, insiders to register or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only one 2011 was taken by 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, discontinue the right to register voters in the day and will take away the right to vote from citizens who have a prior conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no American state does not oblige voters to present photo identification.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana is the first state, which introduced such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law, enacted in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican officials rushed to extend this practice and to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years, they initiated bills that obligate voters to present photo ID, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that unlike the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity cards, as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people, have reached the required for voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by government authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often more than one hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions are disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But it is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students - voters believed to vote for candidates from the Democrats in several states are not allowed to use the photo identification issued by their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote largely for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of American citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is believed that two thirds of the Latin American voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, registration of voters on election day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction does not have passed without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped make lists of about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall of 17% level of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were african, although the past accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened with pseudo-academician from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.</seg>
<seg id="41">Unlike white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several draft laws was vetirovano governors Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most ambiguous laws was suspended when the intervention of the prosecutor general of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This enabled partly to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring interpleader photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules, joined the action, of course, make it extremely difficult to implement the right to vote in the election of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Report centre Brennan from 2011 shows that states who accepted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the test for dog gives sometimes erroneous results, lzenegativnie, and sometimes lzepozitivnie that lead to useless medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">Men, and so reluctantly undergoing dispanserizaciu, have something to hesitate, even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinions of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among groups of investigational, however the findings it is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time a European, found different level of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who have not passed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed that after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of a metastasis at 30-40% higher for those who had not passed screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, I would recommend pass the test since 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men achievers who also are at increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is making the right decisions, as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cancer can be as aggressive and low-level.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient will need to clarify the extent of the risk of his cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not harmful to life in the long term, but given the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men who have detected cancer, will undergo treatment because their cancer was not aggressive and pose no threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will they offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, the a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all the people ate cool and quite moving, 30% of cases Rako could have been prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoked, this figure would have gone up at least 50%," said Andre stunning, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It causes enormous damage to the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," says spokesman Andre stunning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging fact: ten years after stopping smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the car, being overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," added to the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The Association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancers of the colon.</seg>
<seg id="41">Should avoid the sausages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Recent may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for the moment, the results of these studies is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the opinion of the SCC, studies of vitamin E given conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also not fully clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">But Mr. stunning stresses that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bozon boson in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last summer the message that scientists may have managed to detect Bozon boson, caused a real boom – and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this Bozon explains mass of all of the particles in the universe, nothing a little.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, this is the latest particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or, anyway, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and behavior of matter, but that hadn't been found by experience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physicists have still not sure that the question is about Bozon boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that she strongly resembles Bozon boson predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for the complete confidence of some of the data still lacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all the same, that it is about Bozon boson, as the chances of mistaking seem minimal, and look at what this means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world of one law is absolutely inevitable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">To get around this rule there is no possibility, even don't try too hard, otherwise to harm himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that there is one law of similar nature: the Pauli exclusion, which posits that the two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "a quantum state" this state is, in general terms, in some of its characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based on this, the physics share particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, who sensibly subject to the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the other, the scurrying around the element, a stark a gang of anarchist who have no respect for anything – at least to this principle, which means that they can she would be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to website (by the way, is completely extraordinary) Particle adventure laboratory Berkeley, these element are divided, in turn, into two groups: meson, about which we say we will not, and the "particles force" through which apply the basic forces of nature and to which in some ways is Bozon boson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These same element, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it's thanks to one incredibly banal Bozon: photon, or particle of light ," which is a courier of electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge is accelerating or changing direction, this violates the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like stone meets in the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this breach is born electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photon – and, therefore, a ten-fold "super-spreaders" of force. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same happens with Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this Bozon appeared to be violated different field, the boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">However the boson much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to his institute, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface which could move only a very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as the one that operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! "to achieve such enormous energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all the particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Likewise, not all the particles interact with the field and boson: those that interact with masses, while others (like the photon, by the way), it does not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what "can bring" all of these studies, asks Ms. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science, they are used to check the accuracy of the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find a divergence between the results of observations and predictions.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides, some of them passionately crave to this divergence was found, as the slightest discrepancy may open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The last, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, not offering any explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates approximately 80% of the universe (ouch, ouch!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But so far at CERN such disparities have not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The consequences of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person, it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in the laboratories of Bell could not even guess what the revolution will cause them to work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They envisioned their applications in science, but not more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratories of Bell, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were flashlamp-pumped) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen rather as "design-and-integration gadget."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine....</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application may fall to instruments, accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small sensor light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though this was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the eye for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize in physics, 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all may be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care is the best way to die... / debt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate soon to be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, in this crucial area much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Debt tried to look closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in monterezi.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, it from inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years, I have lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house palliative care - Victor gadbua in Belykh, which arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock to this it is impossible to prepare," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its job: incredible weakness that does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees that he helped to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bodrit he even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage before the usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest desire to me to be cured from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this malaise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"For the life of us are taught that a man must urinate while standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in runaway-house victor - gadbua.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regress to the condition of the child - for some an unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It all depends on the person's ability to" come to terms with the decline, "he argues.</seg>
<seg id="19">So how, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events sluchayaut and in the midst of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who arrive in palliative chyorniy Victor - gadbua, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts given them a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses did not provide more assistance, called curatively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms. L.A.Vesselaya, 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has allowed me to get to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," she added.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I want nothing in life," she says, before authorising put her mask, relieving breath.</seg>
<seg id="27">She still awaits in the coming days the last visit his son, who had arrived from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In runaway-house Victor - gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the death of more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants one place in the institutions of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Then life goes on in the best conditions, any possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors Priut.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether the comfort of physical, emotional or soul.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we accept provide mouth mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi-Cola, watching what he will ask.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics we no longer make control sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we brought beer Mr. X., who died today at night.</seg>
<seg id="39">On the morning of his son dopil this beer at his feet from the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help loved ones, as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of patient care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In runaway-house Viktor - gadbua no one day is not like the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to 93 years old man who revels in his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and all to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy with cancer under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel concerned about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients taken to a shelter - Victor gadbua, arriving from home, and 47% from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, to care that is available to alleviate the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or at the orphanage.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as shelter Viktor - gadbua society and palliative care at home a large Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is this big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors and specialists in palliative care to fear the law, an assisted death and help in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, circulates manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and endorsing their disagreement with a similar initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not effective to secure the right to high quality palliative care, will be allowed to transfer euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to help them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard were already minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I reported my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said that she regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">This she herself told me that my days were numbered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martell believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanking medical personnel, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team on palliative care makes their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in struggle with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to alsi Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home a Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time, or constantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Be more than to pretend that we don't know about these suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I want to have an assisted death," which means "I want for me, it became easier."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="8">These factors make me daily to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything is happening very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not raspalyaus.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the outset in the centre of the provisional training in NIF in clerfontene and to my parish in St. Etienne I always Chagall forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you benefit from the competition, by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Recruits this summer is not new in playing matches on a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training session is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that a player like me, is eager to be at the level and attention to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">He helps such deputy, as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspire respect to the technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with VX735 clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had with him was hopeful the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I moved from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which he renders me, also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season psg?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league, Lyon took we have a leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in one eighth final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether psg become a top European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He has to do this already have the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate the position of a long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially from psg have the means to make the project viable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we are valid ardently want to win this championship title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were to this close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, it was disappointment, because we had all to come to the finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think, everything will be fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have entered such strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media waiting for too much from psg?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully prepared for this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we buy the house BWS-D-4-0 against Andre Vingt-Trois and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what the first expect us to people.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of BWS-D-4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not of FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to implement the project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We proved in the Champions League, that we can respond to the challenges we face today.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United, which is already two season fails to pass in one cop-2 the final, although they too have spent a lot of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the invested amount, we were 15 points ahead of already for winter half-time.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be a disdain for our opponents and timed to France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were awakened this new psg.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how great the first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and tell myself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSG, it seems, entirely depends on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">And that, if they say that there is a certain zlatanozavisimost.</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scored a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first of the league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it is really only.</seg>
<seg id="78">This stimulates and others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tyago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have experienced Euro 2012 against France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I earnestly wish to participate in this euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">There I have seen many things, and I came out stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I manage to play a good selection of the matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I had hoped since my baptism in blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months of Didier led blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They are for him successful.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in qualifying group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">He was strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I wouldn't want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached his goal, he qualified us into the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">Hope that Didier Deschamps will lead blue in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Good Honored draw (1-1), virvannaya October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us belief in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each had fought for all.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With the end of 2014, the invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since their irresistible promotion from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood from a struggle between the various factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Time-chartering them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women paid for bigotry these farmers, in which their surpassed Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our time.</seg>

<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent decentralized, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution 1964.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Heavy birth of Egypt ' s constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Is a new risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play the all-in.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago the head of the state Assembly has provided two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon two years as Egypt relies on preliminary text, which amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative is only reinforced the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate this word" and "flout the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon intentions to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi, seems convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in one interview with the weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The more that the call to fast-track voting resembles the ultimatum the Egyptian people: "or you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals not responded the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights activists, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the brothers - Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is no wonder that in most cases, the articles were progolosovany unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day emerged around... time for prayer, because some members of the committee thought that watches the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday was still voting, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of universal attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, reading that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, had hoped to replace the principles on rules that would enable them to more rigorous application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect to other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hypocrisy, say the liberals, who see in this only public relations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their view, Islamization of the constitution is happening through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar advisory role, particularly in regard to verify compliance with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to specialist in Egypt Sophie pe, it is worrisome, to "people to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the emergence of theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, moreover, excited fact that the rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this the constitution we remain within the civil law.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who worked on this text, is not ulema, and people with a university education, some were taught in the French system ” – soothes Alexis Blom, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that "around article 220 may arise ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence, masculine ed.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges competent to make a decision about this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to their religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives wide powers to the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood say they have significantly reduced compared with those which have been under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another moot point: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of associations for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider subversive for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth forbidden insult that could have serious implications for freedom of expression, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles no longer speaks about protecting women, emphasizes winter moraef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive note is the prohibition of torture in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">Word which does not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president was to speak last night on television, then rallies are planned today in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="2">While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on mandatory language testing in the country have already emerged fraudsters selling fake certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million gastarbeiters.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the most part the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">From December 1, came into effect a law, under which each migrant will be obliged to pass on knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">But overtime, "promise in FMS, tests will become mandatory for all travelers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Handslide rent will have not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of language will have to verify and to obtain, and to renew work permits.</seg>
<seg id="11">An exception is only valid for the citizens of those countries where English is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not subject to the law and the people who have to get certificates and diplomas about education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits are doomed and protection of rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Network examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language of Pushkin, university narodov, MSU, spbsu and other institutions of higher learning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of testing supported gosduma deputies and FMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">But human rights defenders, before the law came into effect, many times in the press had time to ask the question: what is it, in fact, give?</seg>
<seg id="18">That change the obligation of knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the office of FMS in Tajikistan Victor sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protection of their rights should begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only system organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems appear at migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of language is sure sebelev, future migrant doomed face unfair people who under the guise of helping vsunut him start in a terribly close Barack, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, vkalywaya for 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"At home they promise one thing, and on arrival they cheated, select a passport, not pay out the promised wages," confirms chief labor migration ms tadzhikistan tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not cursing, nalnika!!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, while many citizens of Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country, which aspire to, but also on their own kind of write with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not so much their fault, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even sensible primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because their families can't even feed the children, not to mention how to properly wear them, shoes and snaryazat to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, they confess.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and deficient."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">True, in respect of the law on language of human rights activists point out one important moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">The testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the same status not - there will be no prom, no further official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiters still live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or outsiders" no entrance for "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the visitors claim that to get official status in our country is not so simple.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all those same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, legalization is worth the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But false registration can be done quickly and for just one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizen tadzhikistan umed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">," Not scrimp, buy painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was revealed that false there are not only migrants documents about registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several fake certificates on the language tests have already seized by FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fake paper printed on the usual color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they got new owners are not for nothing: each of migrants, hoping thus relieve myself the task of passing the tests, paid for document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than two times more expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost 27.08.2008 migrant in three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the main challenge in the near future - to protect the system from corruption to brown it was impossible to simply buy, agree and representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the meantime, the authorities can promise to guest workers who are unable to successfully undergo testing the first time, the time to examine basic language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, the newcomers, not knowledge of Russian, will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the US, supermarkets and fast-food workers go on strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through work on SNAO McDonald goes up to a quarter of all American teens</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days for America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores corporations walmartrecently and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald, "burger king," "Bell's tacos," uandis and "Kentucky fraid Chicken."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one is predicting whether this surge in the ninth shaft or she is to expire in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Stocks supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to increasing the modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, the purpose of the organizers of protests is the creation of the trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this sector of the economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Stocks began last week, after a day of thanksgiving, in the so-called "black Friday," when America has fallen orgy deshevykh sales, annexed the millions of people in the street and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed Port Authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers walmartrecently Corporation, in which around the world, employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporations, whose goods subtracts the people on modest and middle incomes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries before vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores on average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">However many low-wage workers walmartrecently come only at their work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Accessibility and range of goods made walmartrecently one of America's largest corporations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pays its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain about poor working conditions, for example, on the lack of trucks or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants of the shares in the "black Friday" required to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">The typical worker walmartrecently, receive 9.5 dollars per hour, this rashod.pravda not afford, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart Ordabasy srednuuu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation at 3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely shift wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the shop will do them all on 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For a year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than it is now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters walmartrecently fairly note that protests have occurred only in nine states and not corporations or damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" continued in its stores with 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its cash registers produced in "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Representative Dan Fogelman Corporation claimed in an interview with the left-wing site the huffington post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just a "another deadline-driven stunt" organized crimes and its trade union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free tickets!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and so their lyrics are not yet), and McDonald and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you the hospital and not paying you for honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Williams, a member of the city council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants in time her increase, but not much, and their average ordinary workers receive in new york 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less of them in this expensive city not earning no one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can you live in New York for the money, for me, is incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through McDonald took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who the job for them to function after school, living with parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw it as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I am constantly coming across an interview with workers McDonald, who complain that must live on that salary and sometimes even feed on her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal newspaper hangeth comment, whose author notes that irresponsibly kids, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. in the morning on Thursday at McDonald on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and the cooks fast food system began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum salary.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the fast food were created by trade union organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish activists trade union movement was harassed and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But cover union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main "extraordinary turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The dissenters</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day meeting with mcdonald's near Times Square, which is made by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you the hospital and not paying you for honest work!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, who said "we must all join in support of workers fast food so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Described as the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But in bymore only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid public, which in New York, employs tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">While it is unclear whether this would create a spark the flames of the mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">"As long as the fool the brain turns out medium"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality has lately been seen mostly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First summer at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then in November it was reported that the application for the patent filed, and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But from the conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in laboratory Microsoft balls Izadi follows that for scientists this company glasses - the time passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their tempting prospect dash-dot virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Tell us, please, in general terms, what does your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until mankind in the mass of apple at the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes ticanya in them with his finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, because all the interesting zestovoe management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"That still waiting for us ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Despite the fact that the Kinect had interaction on a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Enter information improved (the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional systems display on the basis of different technologies, including proectivnikh.</seg>
<seg id="15">Need to release a computer world in our, physical, to make it a more palpable.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"What do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It's definitely not a panacea - the question of privacy because they don't always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought on gestures, but not above verbose, and over such stingy, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not the camera device, and wrist bracelet, which recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While he is a big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of the wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general the future for mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Is how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"For example, as you ask me to give you this bank soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"You want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Absolutely not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely define human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution for depth, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, do you have any pretensions to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Lacks permission, depth or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"In principle the current generation is what can make a start in our work over trivariate recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 to / from.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not in the megapixels, and as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the latest point of view of all current technologies for us not good enough – it adds to the work of designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is, we need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X and Y, and Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Is also very important the speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Movement of a man quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen from our lab did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 to 100) index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would in my work is very useful for the equivalent of such a device, not only requires touch to frames per second was more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"And the number of cameras increase not need to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And now a third camera is, actually, a typical sensor visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it, increasing the required volume of payments.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible similar to Kinect, play with curved location cameras and see how this will help in determining the provision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think that in terms of day-to-day use technologies augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Of course, all the slob around, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the best option would be financed is supplemented by reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch to glasses on a smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses is a very personal device, in that their strength (Suurtuki things you see only you), and simultaneously weakness, which is supplemented by reality based on the points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony stark from the" iron man ," but an ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which often indicate critics of such ideas: no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands nothing feel!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepares to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lectures I often say that accompanied the reality is the seventh to score a breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth may well be additive of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">She perfectly registers clicking!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving here are the pictures in the air "circulating – for example, electrons several targeted ultrasound beams to a certain point, where is your finger, gives a sense of, but it is very weak – as if you are blowing on the pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">There and bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">But have you tried to trick the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him think that he feels that vainness must feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"This is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another task on which to beat for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is on an open, almost infinite - work and above concepts jogging (no such as the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balloons.</seg>
<seg id="73">While fool the brain turns out medium, work is still very much for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes working on virtual reality such attractive to researcher - many things in its infancy.</seg>

<seg id="5">To save humanity, raising the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is small.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact these planets only two that you can explore at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the state institute for astronomy name p.k. Sternberg () Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if conditions on Mars more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus – temperature 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Approach to matters of reproduction in space started with flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even half a century ago, conducted experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations raised on orbit peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the spacecraft in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 in space have sent eggs perepeloc to check, as the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get at the exit is absolutely normal young bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But further begins the problem.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem with the fact that this nestling should find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," explains head of laboratory institute of biomedical problems (IMBP) vol.9 Vladimir sichev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours of infants therea full atrophy instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks not react to light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there the trouble was that, through four days they just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And two times we viluplyali chicks, after it refused to, because simply cannot be there with them to work," notes the failure of the experiment with birds in space Vladimir sichev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With animals last time the biological minikovtcheg flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">However on biosputnike Bion will only same-sex individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Was an experiment with rats that sent into space is already with the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there is nothing supernatural not found.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's just been on biosputnike, but again is a single experiment, and such studies have to spend," said Vladimir sichev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing from space rats appeared posterity.</seg>
<seg id="31">But approach the problem of over-multiplication directly in space until it turns out.</seg>
<seg id="32">Easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, losing, their customary habitata, simply can't realize their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">Man, unlike the animal, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create a consistent emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women in space travel is already 50 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was at tereshkovoy.</seg>
<seg id="39">But the most precious that have humanity, is a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether it will survive after the flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"On this question no one answered," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child Andriyan kherson-nikolaev also was a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana conditions, twice in orbit and even elaboration in outer space, my son was born.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have very little unit Tetraodon astronauts that after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if more, this is dangerous even for orbital flights," summarizes cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of the Russia's Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, the humanity to look for any new path in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Gidrolaboratoria rgnii - mandatory stage of preparation for flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the neutral buoyancy test-cosmonaut puchberg skills working in open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If adult water, albeit studio.The, but still alien environment, for infants - native element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ihtiandri if confirmed - life on land came out of the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between what the baby is around 9 months with his mother in fluid, it is easier to get on then to water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to something to forget," says instructor grudnichkovogo swimming Marina axenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if a child born to a more natural state of weightlessness, for women - necessary gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Very quickly in weightlessness dryahleut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to tidal the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well okay, skip and it is, relying on stimulants generic activities.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, she chasing him.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then what?" asks not trivial questions Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">No sense of gravity, the body does not form a skeletal and muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a suit for additional training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">He simply will be deprived of that he will be vital.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment, in which we go, having admitted the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground with a disability, fully dezadaptirovannogo person," foresees the head of the committee on bioethics IMBP vol.9 Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Until the birth of children in space is a question the theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, later the time it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships mentione on a distant planet, which will become home to their descendants, born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of the main security auditing department: checking Schwartz - system failed at the hands of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement Czechia has good control authorities and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav pakhsa, vice president of the supreme security audit management, from an interview for the website aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but apply it should properly, which, in my opinion, we have not enough," commented on the current situation pakhsa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices use-causes Petr Nečas approach to the so-called Schwartz - system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - leaves it is prohibited or allowed to?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be in any way set, and if it is something prohibits, and the prime minister can't resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to meet its obligations," stated pakhsa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The parallel test, which we began, perhaps, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, talking about the fact that European legislation says, how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also use in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished d.arago., there were interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we can be "accurate and defaultless," but in practice we in certain parameters are behind Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, should focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But actually as this project can help you that he was mean to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That is the kind of joint control may contribute to efforts to stop atualizações laws, cutting and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means getting the appropriate thing for the reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps this system perepolnit papers so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much easier than if the restriction is not dropped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as a system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there a the organization as our chickens (security the audit management) or it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the institutions, there as our chickens CSIRT Bundesrechnungshof, arranged on our principle, there is also the board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the authority to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are divisions of audit and on the level of federal lands in their system of several different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can manage only the federal money, we have public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal calculation chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for local laws, there are simpler than we have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany you can take a sample, but you can't say definitely that it better in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is so, because they are better at dealing with the control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, but again, I like the comparisons don't like.</seg>
<seg id="31">But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow treatemnts consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it is not in our control.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some of the delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Take this into account only in the process of training of future inspections "we started to use our new tool to detect risk neakonnosti," through which we were taken away almost 14,000 government contracts have them analyzed. there, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope, it is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can occur is that rules tighter and it will be impossible to follow.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules controlled entities are related to suppliers (for example, regional operational programs - from the regional council) that any failure of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think that is not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error not influencing the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then to get out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's recognize that this path will lead you to nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently the prime minister has said that it will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called Schwartz - system... what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"Schwartz - the system" is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be in any way set, and if it is something prohibits, and the prime minister can't resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to fulfill their commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "we reverse this law and solve this," but you cannot say that will pretend that nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that protects public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified just because of technical flaws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we have not enough.</seg>

<seg id="37">Next year, we would have gladly held view in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the US, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The group The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, strollers them to fly in the cargo hold of, plus a large amount of cargo and mailboxes with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, so far, to deal with this without problems. Czech Airlines čsa and British airlines British Airways have always been great for us prepared that surprised me how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to participate abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward disabled people, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you faced to date?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is functioning better than we have, in Russia we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague in Moscow are a lot of barriers, and there still is a new independent movement of a man in an electric wheelchair in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there in the course of such banal things like give way to a disabled person in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there already are social organizations who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In what, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are so many things, the level of performance which far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disability independently moving on the streets, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, so anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in social life, in this we them with The tap tap a little bit ahead.</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariernost is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really starts to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">As this single cases - people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Group The tap tap currently is very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998, you caused her to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the institute Jedliczka as a tutor, around me were a lot of young people who wanted something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I'm a musician and play the saxophone, along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with time, says our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Popularity came only in the last few years, I mixed up or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can evaluate, in fact as if it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the European Union can we afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Standing there in front of you the goal so well turn the tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business is full of things, one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and lasts this long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, it naturally...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this completely excessive pity, because people with disabilities are not some patients and all abandoned un-ennobling, which we should feel sorry for.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only provided that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities something it turns out, this shift is not only for them but also for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Tvro whether the success of what you closely.44 klytcheva, how many of you believe?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the job properly, we need to be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I believe that it is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly in the clouds, and when you know that the two times per week they should go to rehearsal, visit pre-sessionals and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But as happens in any group that wants to work and accomplish something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently in the group The tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were in the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Ladya Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open a group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have a desire and will power, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will be held a day before the expected the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA 12 September 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with esa-registered in 1994 and for years took an active part in a number of projects the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the path to space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts 06-66988 flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me remind you, for example, about the lecture and, 6 December 1933 represented in Varsovian astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of recalled that only Dr. Ian was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France won the prize - Robert Hesnault peltri and Andre Luiz Hersh for "Introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Ian (1899 – 1966), about which mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Has become a well-recognized promoter of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built körtér drezine, equipped with missile engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking fruck was to be used by a rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this drezine known only from the press of the era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to wonder about missile Strel.</seg>
<seg id="17">Study ccnewspapers.com. section weapons technology in collaboration with professors Mieczysława volfke and Gustav mokzickim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the surviving material shows that studies have reached the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in the specialized print appeared the idea of photovoltaic power missiles, fighter, which suggested an engineer, and the following year came the work of "air missile - torpedo and NCSPB-25150MI rocket bomb" author lielivi - kzivoblockogo.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war all projects military use rocket technology was a temporary scientific advisory committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo - naukowy), which coordinated the job.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the outbreak of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, devoted to space exploration, appeared in the press after the war, thanks to the work of Polish society Astronautics (Polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 issue of the magazine, which published four volumatic articles on astronawtice.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, Professor M. subotovich offered to organize society that will engage natural-technical.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) sought to join the international federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in autumn ooa became her full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And next year the first chairman of ooa Kazimierz zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the international federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 ooa contributed a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful meteorological missiles RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket to overcome the distance of 1,800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently was built the enhanced version of rm - 1a, and in the summer of 1959 bledowsk test was conducted on a vacant lot two-stage missile rm - 2.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket was in length of about 1.4 meters, and her weight was about 11.5 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the missile was already in a position to engage in this scientific work is cyclone-3 rm - 34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, the further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Heiress the first missiles of the type of RM became the Meteor missile, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 years.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as the two-stage, its total length was 510 sm., and the initial weight - kzt32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Has developed three type (identified as Meteor - 1a, H-1B and KV-1S), which varied by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Meteor missile - 1a had pythonproducts MAC-2009 0.4 VILLA-TURKISH, Meteor H-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor KV-1S - 0, 62l.</seg>
<seg id="42">Maximum range at all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 years in aviation institute chelyabinsk-based development Meteor missiles, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor - 2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring cargo weighing 10 pounds to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built versions of the Meteor - 2n and Meteor is 3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee of the COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, the programme intercosmos, Poland participated in the research space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonavt after Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the Constitutional Court annulled a law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision provoked a lively debate in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal user-focussed economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that individual economic unit, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labour (salary) raises price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept need to understand the condition when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods is trying to withstand economic competition that is pushing the cost of a competitor to pick up a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where the cost of the labor force, compared with other high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for produced them unemployment, growing the inevitable government spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation raises the reluctance of gentlemen of employers pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that need no specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Besceremonnye methods of private capital to create the economies of individual states a situation where governments are forced to join in competition with each other, to artificially lower social level of its population, with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments Start-ClusteredMailboxServer own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to force economically his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and at the same time as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the field of labor laws.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of rising levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already approaching one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of increasing competitiveness of the German economy is constantly there are cases when the employed people get a salary that the state they must pay extra to receive a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under pressure from the catastrophic fall of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on extremely low pay on the margins of society, in the hope that someday the country will come to private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But launches, where he will undertake?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds are to come from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Next, you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">Definite answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of almost almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result we are hopeless situation, an emerging in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all the deserved punishment, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is such that the government ministries because of a lack of financial resources to develop bills private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills argues the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, as the constitution says Western-style, but from the financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberal democracy is now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described Appian in the artwork "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has been disintegrating, and agencies are involved in violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal obtaining favours using stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with previously sold voice "..." decent people in general are not candidates for the position of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul ...."" seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this awful situation is autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic person .." Appian thought that this will be of Pompey, but they became a Caesar, who finally replaced autocracy to democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Cur9incumbents result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline of elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">It causes of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">First of all tragic is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least, not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both on international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus this trend is systemic in nature.</seg>
<seg id="49">The decision are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="21">Their thirst for global power in the period from 1859 by 1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created great Mason 33rd level Al solderings.</seg>
<seg id="22">The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially the UK, and a third should lead to a reduction of the world ' s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (so many slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a prerequisite for this project) and final seizure of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Method by which working group of the richest families headed by the rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent soltuions (Order AB Chao - order out of chaos.) </seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>

<seg id="26">The first world war ended a sudden, unsound in warrior and economically surrender of Germany (there was no need for the war to destroy the tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing central European powers, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war the bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations than created a premise to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans strong enough denouncing perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, with sparking the fire of war.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>

<seg id="31">Outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler escaped from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or everything that he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created conditions for recognition of the Jewish state the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations on 2 world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create nidus war the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers will manage to unleash, Jewish people, like in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is as if a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also internationally (take only the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is to blame and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to a world power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers off people to vote in the election solely their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel ' s current prime minister, Netanyahu, a hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician that makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the chokepoint, containing 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), also lead to the destruction of the global economy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, the crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the US, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation not meant she couldn't afford to throw overboard Shah, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after talks brokered by the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and antiiranskih sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran have largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential elections of 1980 ended the election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Film, actor longer-lasting "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities have managed to take them from Iran, helped extravagant Lehenda cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, in the country a place for filming science fiction epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Plan, which invented the expert on evacuation of Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To legend was reliable, in specialist magazines wrote about the film, hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation have long held in secret, the film, is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Film afflecu is a special combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film - kinoopus," the story of a successful venture, scam - example could be a number of films about friends.</seg>
<seg id="20">The film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (in a caption displayed significant historical photos of events and how those same situation were demonstrated in the film - the big difference in this not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and moderate an exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies are men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations on the stairways institutions, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben afflecu admirationful managed to make resets career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vismeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, äåòêà, goodbye " (2007) and the thriller" city " (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first film afflecu, who has not starred in hometown director - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sense of the atmosphere of the place when this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck and it manifests in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film are happening on the streets, when the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy is impressive its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and nepredvidennosti, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing story.</seg>
<seg id="30">Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieved in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Far too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply many exciting scenes to the cinematic values.</seg>
<seg id="33">He quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something dodumivaet is there all this goes not as elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America to prevent the looming crisis in the airport in Tehran, and the chase on the runway look pretty farfetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Lack of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are in the film are not alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Film afflecu lacks a little bit of drama, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest 1quent phílos and retro style, re-creating thrillers seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But captures with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, and also for evidence of how exaggerated ideas about the almighty and omniscient security services.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducts the annual survey of the most grotesque bank fees, now decided to declare the competition for "the most absurd ruling or project from the workshop of the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"We made to this recent event, in which the EU plans to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said organizer Patrick Nager questionnaire law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among already put forward for nomination the absurdity is the recent decision by the European Court to unify the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women have benefits for life insurance because insurance companies they are objectively are less prone to risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate to the contest before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The controversial orders of the EU, for example, and compulsory adding biocomponentow in fuel, as a result of the damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of the cages for hens, which this year significantly tightened the eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also criticized was a de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoe butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Qualitative bananas must be length of 14 inches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">EU-wide the device often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus Czechia now even under threat of the veto is defending claims its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Interests lobby are: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and would not have dared to show "unusual curvature."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the that only harmonizes existing patchwork of national rules that complicating trading.</seg>
<seg id="14">The EU, despite the resistance of some states, yet softened standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that existing directive will lead to vast products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Candidate to win in the poll may become and last year's ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons should be warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU turned to American research, under which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">That restriction now applies to children up to the age of 14, which prohibited blow in the trade fair dudelki.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Funny ideas are born and at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Enough is absurd and rule regarding the European officials: everyone who has the EU any official position, cannot, given the sensitive nature of the topics for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead talk to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYROM).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Portal bankovnípoplatky.com in collaboration with the association of liberal economists "principle of non-interference" (laissez-faire), proposed to vote, in addition to several above these absurd rules, for example, rule the EU about the amount of food reserves in the membership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently Czechia exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Organizers of the questionnaire also are interested in the idea of pay and some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Will ask the European Union for compensation, "said in the fall of 2004, the then minister of agriculture jaraslau Palace (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional procurement state had full of warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">That the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palace, was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission has gone towards the Czech Republic, a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies to obtain subsidies proposed villages the ministry of regional development, the Swedish minister Pavel German (US - DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: bizarre orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the resolution in member states can easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU for regulation, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Serious problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies on projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening European integration, but which the member states have made when discussing the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Evokes emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and by the Austrians have retained the name "Czech curds," but "rum," whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the tuzemak.</seg>
<seg id="36">Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products the EU, along with the world-famous feta cheese and gorgondzola, marcipan from a German luebeck or parma ham, has already proved, for example, in Karlovy Vary rusks, and carp and hops.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of carrot and gorzickie tubes.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want me to guarded republic, but I'm an amateur, "says Okamura.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind running for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't think about becoming a senator or a president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we have in the country all functioned without problems, then I ' m not running.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't watch over the past 20 years the country are as immediately scurrying around the thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I don't like, then try to find a solution, as this change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I have already turned forty years and I am an independent person, not flight.Children to any party, I have no other way to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, you hit, but soon went to the presidential castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you thus not turn back to the people that you have chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I all the time said that included in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">I later clarified that if the senator will be chosen, will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not the position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">However I need the greatest influence and broad powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation have grumbling themselves in a bar or watching TV, but are ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this is added the media that person vilify, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, about me saying that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an advisor Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Go to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fight for the presidential castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the property declarations on the amount above 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To accomplish this, you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have as a president such powers not, and only the whole Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">Do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in politics "when someone comes in with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, which discourages citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nonpartisan person I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I am without party arrangement on to explain, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You think of yourself as a person, more relevant to the right or to the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important at all - a little to the left or to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important that we go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not about what someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always support any good for society, will offer whether his hrcm or GDP, and I just will be against a bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You get angry when someone says that you populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But do not prove whether you that what you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And to this, you have to try to match.</seg>
<seg id="37">You can call it populism, but all the proposals on which I say, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that in politics you do not hold on for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or you think that when you get to people and talk to them, then you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them to his side, so that we have accomplished their goal.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, not be any problem to organise a live television broadcast, in which I draw on the heads of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they, in the case of failure, should be to tell why this does not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality, which makes the abuse, it will put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president - it was merit of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies, to defend their beliefs and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I'm only a novice in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">Things I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, six years to finish and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is partly sounds as though Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm no not the savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one I did not do, so I went around a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Radimov yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also at least supported leading an investigation into the journalist Jan lorencovu, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I put forward his candidacy, because people are really dissatisfied with, but now I feel like the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us independent in the Senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You think about the basis of their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I haven't thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential champion-a, and I have no money on this.</seg>
<seg id="63">No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kronor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about property declarations, and how your own affairs with this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a plot in Prague worth approximately $25 million, flat at $10 million, another apartment on 8 million art collection of around 10 million, Aston Martin to 3.5 million and Skoda superb per million, and even a few million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way - Aston Martin I have appeared, because it was my dream – I always liked Bond, who traveled by car, was gallant with women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You travel to Aston – martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say you want to change the country, but especially in this to invest their own money do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I invested in a campaign already 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Spending on campaign I essentially cover senator salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But on the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son of the English school, worth 30,000 a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to just make money, so they would not be running.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Means, then you will be doing business, so that we may live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Do you not saying that simple-cut this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, their activities I partially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, managing director of travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like that I was bessrebrennik, which will store the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive monthly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From 200 to 400 thousand that receive and further.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I become president, his business would be finished.</seg>

<seg id="1">Architects MVRDV argue that the real adventures are not only in the imagination – for example and his recently constructed book mountains - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"To me it seems like fun, it looks futuristichno, finally we have again, you can see something interesting," says Lisette, a passerby on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Stefan Spermon, a specialist in IT at the nearby a large company, said: "no, this building really beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask myself: why us today, another library?</seg>
<seg id="5">All have the internet, the iPad and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now no one voluntarily not attend such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">, Maloprimechatelnu sleeping town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population of 80,000 people, has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the overall education and build seven fictional bridges that are depicted on the euro notes, in the form of a painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to beat the statistics: build a library here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame the Meuse from Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold ordered diagrams and author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual combination of calmness and appeared to be listening in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, impertinent Meuse folded from his original gift pyramid diamec and completed it in defense of his project with the following words: "dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in, the so-called bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain cost of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in total of 50 flats.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, "the book" was marked by a second prize contest "the best library niderlands 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project also involved in the national Dutch 27.06.2009 wooden structures, 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not suggest anything but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely Premostratensians, white facades which suggest the milk, became richer on one contemporary work of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important thing - in appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: book el-dorado under the cage for the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Here only one elevator, Babycrabs in the center of the mountain massif, because these fans of architecture and reading will choose to explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and elegant street lamps errorfree create a sense of public the town square.</seg>
<seg id="25">City environment re-established ideal.</seg>
<seg id="26">View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually the bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and impersonal," says blame the Meuse.</seg>
<seg id="29">We set a classic configuration space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner space book mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, online library, chess club, ecological center and technical areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Particularly delight black bookcases, which are then finishing walls, lined, cheap railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their appearance, texture and smell the unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated architects and engineers and builders are lost at guessing what the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop trauborst, the head of the project, representing community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter-wave thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">Delicate textiles serves a couple of seasons, after that he can throw away.</seg>
<seg id="39">For library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes – was pressed in the four centimetres thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material to smell a little like a new car and a bit of sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top of the lead 105 dobropolye.</seg>
<seg id="42">Those who overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquet ficusami and trees in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity on literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Costs of the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite plenty of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology," says trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">For his heating and cooling of used warmth of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Broad farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular glass facade, provide shade and assume most of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection to provide fully automatic roller blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the aforesaid skeptic from areas of IT, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lizette also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as our traditional Chinese medicine Sintija Bogarde, which called bukenberg "soul, which has long lacked."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own meeting.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves not yet fully staffed library at the time it was the 70.000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">Shelves zastawleni top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than empty library," says architect't blame the Meuse.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way associated with this new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And if they are very young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is only the starting point for building identity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Clogs: "the Germans should play a more important role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow the diplomatic track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians ' bid to get observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence – while not speaking too critical toward Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the no-go zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, NATO has conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact of the matter is that she is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely passes from policy, which, so to speak, led by the US, to actually German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent Edinaya policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but these people are not used to this.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that as long as they only track their role, but are on the path to more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically means normal foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This willingness to borrow in its national interest position unaffected by the position of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests of Germany largely differ from the interests of the other large states, and so Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Influenced whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">However it must be very careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, this plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany really harmed its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as a vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the US dominates understanding of the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">However I do not think that this was the same dramatic nadl, as the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany even ganhará thus a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena, and that with its interests should be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, clearly favours a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">If there are differences of opinion between the US and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The power of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in conjunction with the local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant, as always seems to be.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama didn't love the policies of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany is it easy to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on one side and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes this a difficult situation for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there were a single, a consistent European policy, but now it's not.</seg>
<seg id="47">However they could not act in the broader approach and instead forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is how they come with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in the development of a common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This theme has always been fine.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she would take on a really major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or a leading role still struggled Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet got used to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far always struggled to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis – each time Germany assume an important role, treatemnts various antigermanskie feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans are not just deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view of Germany is in a much more precarious position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, US influence in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like that, unpleasant or reinforces the enmity to you – this is life!</seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani - internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what the Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">This is officially registered in China, the name, which has nothing to do with firms, from the names of which it formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the original names not put an action.</seg>
<seg id="6">But even then it is unclear whether they assert their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Foreigners all the harder it becomes to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas pattloh, lawyer company Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of the rights to the trademark in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Imitatoram enough add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So from Gucci LM-hash Lu - Gucci, Prada, instead you can register a Prada - Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">These same way legally copied the German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloh opens the folder with records desectionments registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010 the Chinese company has registered there trademark Zegna DF puma, artificial name, which also used the name of fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese are world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In big cities have manystoreyed department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, no such case pattloha. on behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from desectionments trademark registration right to use the name, which is already protected by somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "ban," Mark is the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word associated with "ban dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">So call the women who hunt for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It damages the business, with the need to fight," convinced pattloh.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Brand while, a unique position is lost, the image suffered tremendously."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research company, notes clsa, China with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">But achieving the removal of questionable entries in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court dismissed claims, because after a long time the opposed name became "a reality in the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a complainant is lucky, he will have to pay even plagiatoru, as the damaged his trade sign in China, says pattloh.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes is ruled by the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also the famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer SANY, enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired a concrete pump maker Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the Chinese still have the right to use a logo similar to star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely bought Volvo company initially used a blue and white logo, "BMW; process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Fashionable goods maker Lacoste lost simulator in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thority trademark registration ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year was "return from an emergency situation in workflow to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the number of unprocessed affairs on abjections decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Fight with this is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Very often in China, the figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million complaints about the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This record and means that China in the tenth consecutive time headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the department.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, just 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 it paid $1.8 billion yuan collectings.</seg>
<seg id="47">If 14gbps, this means that each registration costs an average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Appeal against her is worth many times more, as shown in the case of a German family businesses shut since Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the group is fighting against Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Germans managed to achieve what the illegal production of them fake auto parts has been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the simulator secured a Chinese rights to the trademark shut since Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was its own omission as a surname in Germany are not subject to the protection, says Broadcasting ventcler, chairman of the board shut since Thursday Chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Thority and registration of trademarks ctmo munhencev rejected the claim.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, in both these instances shut since Thursday won, but the other party continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Need to be on</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Ventcler hopes to bring the case before a good completion and praise the professionalism of the plane.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and robs us a lot of time, money and the nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs unlikely to succumb to the accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago to bring evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago shut since Thursday vain suggested loathly side of the "great six-digit amount in euros" for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This makes it clear how expensive it is to us," says ventcler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The danger of the Far East threatened to infect even in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Namely if simulators register there for an unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name shut since Thursday for footwear and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"You need to be vigilant," says ventcler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and the lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that is in any way is worth defending, register also in China," says ventcler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can do much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Really: if shut since Thursday to lose in the last act of his drama about a commercial sign, should pay loathly side of licensing fees for its own name, explains ventcler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise we are excluded from the market in the controversial segment.</seg>

<seg id="36">The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea tripper ().</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STDs are HIV, the human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pediculez and scabies refer to labour STIs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main porazaemie group?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">Among heterosexual adults common sexually transmitted diseases is, are infection, trihomoniaz, candidiasis (the fungus), gonorrhea and human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - virus.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults we have relatively low – but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among youth infections occur much more often than among other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have among young people also often meets human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - the virus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As changing the number of cases of infection?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were nearly 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Is about a tenth lower than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Any symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">With infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints during urination, selection, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and the bubbles or seal.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Partly because the projection of sexually transmitted diseases that can be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">However experts recommend regular inspection, especially for frequent change of sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">With early diagnosis can cure most of STIs and avoid far-flung consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Patronage, donations and not least of all royalties for choir performances throughout Germany allow something to collect.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Only we sent in asitzeni already about 200,000 euros," says Annie Lennartz, chairman of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village of money from Germany manage codva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.</seg>
<seg id="64">She also cares for the orphans were well organized, for example in one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogos, both called on zulussk old women, it is the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and take care of children in the form of each day in time to appear on the lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who have not left home, go to the shelter to, a lonely woman, who receive a salary from the association, as well as two cook who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, the association "Voices For Africa" organized a sewing school, built two henhouse and jointly with the American organisation for the protection of the health of the PSI organized apr-04 analysis for HIV for many residents of the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is hard to imagine, but about a disease that is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annie Lennartz, "because he is associated with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusually for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King msvati III, is known for its love of largesse.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such unauthorized state lifestyle also lays the blame for the fact that the virus ich so quickly spread in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But she is also on a stray workers who carry the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms have literally on every corner, says Annie Lennartz, "but they almost do not use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture - the flesh to flesh. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Slightly to support cultural exchange, the choir ibmogni every two to three years, making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the dark continent know since the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus, full of white people who sing songs on the black language – such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that happened, provoked tears in the eyes of the toughest border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">A trip always leads also in asitzeni, where singers vipositiond sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of the river aculveni she more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go in asitzeni, there the light," say the people here.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after 8733 264-km-long flight back to HeidelbergCement, when singers return to hall on the street, you can see that the light burns also here.</seg>

<seg id="7">It should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Presumably, the water is happening with a comet or asteroid collision with mercury.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our views in the universe: major telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608, Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes became more accessible - and their view of space all the deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope, the observatory Hal palomar under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the US, the "big telescope."</seg>

<seg id="58">Mirror "the big South African telescope" in South Africa segmented – for the sake of reducing the cost.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in diameter it reaches roughly eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope tightly fastened by a vertical angle, it limits his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Telescope "Hobby-Japan Eberl" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">His special feature: high ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror is the world's largest telescopes.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In the Chilean observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror should raskinut by as much as 42 meters and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">But the photos should expect no earlier than 2018.</seg>

<seg id="84">The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: he must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for a big explosion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The scientists suggest that Mercury is ice on the south pole.</seg>
<seg id="87">But reliable data about this is not, as the city moves closer to the north pole of the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the mercury is ice.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination is the story of American of Mexican origin.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble residents of the country about the difficult times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American-born torn between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico City I walked along the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and remained in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs pointed to two lines: one for mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for the extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A few seconds I stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my whole life called the mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston called themselves Irishman, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I stopped on a complex structure "American of Mexican origin."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary poorer than those of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Because I pulled his American passport and was in turn for the extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the usual for meeting of the presidents of those countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">President Peña Nieto liskut talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the president of Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico ' s relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans never thought about that in 1848 the United States invaded in Mexico and at the barrel of a rifle forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans think Premyslids, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However it is worth only any statesman US obmolvit though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society away complaints about what Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyaut militancy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In this most complex are relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the US.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the insults?</seg>
<seg id="29">Them enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people who are in this country for yourself opportunities, and those for whom such opportunities not.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history anyone is the father or grandfather - had no opportunity to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most of those were Mexicans a certain type of "dark complexion, untrained, from poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico it see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is an American, not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination confuse and it is not clear, but we know what the country considered her.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We respond to them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us reminder of humiliating defeats and refer to us as a second-class status, as inauthentic Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not good enough say in Spanish, and our ties with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them due to failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We were not would now for silk curtain, finding in the US satiated life, but having lost the spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US even in childhood, and it reminds me that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican descent is a real shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my acquaintances Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the US we called the Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not sufficiently intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans to Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell their friends - Americans about what this beautiful country and how great her visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yeah, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing out.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many grievances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, the binge of corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is a beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sorry, but figure it out with this themselves, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they interact with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in London for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battle in the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease fire agreement between Israel and Hamas ' s can be a fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Possible a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound, traditional, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings ruined; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released with the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in his the eternal the conflict in the Middle East came to change.</seg>
<seg id="7">To this can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" spin in rebellious storm many well-established realities, with the Israelis and Palestinians have not been able to stay aloof from the vortex, shaken the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than previously.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without the winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be executed that occurred this week clashes only strengthened the hand of the security forces on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, say from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the incurred losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that some leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas has intensified its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by currently more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time works for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has acted with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two, the victorious Hamas supporters claim about creating around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, in which the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more proislamistskie insurgents is about to overthrow the rule of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king is threatened by Hamas ' s allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred in the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi strengthened the influence of movement the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator, not special attention to support Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization largely Pjorn with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic normsi Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the hardliners in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israeli missile system "iron dome" justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of derelicted Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the US remained committed to their unchanged positions; many European countries also laid blame for the start of the latest round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the territory of Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes to the territory of the West Bank is a significant part of the unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is in preparation for the January 22 election is reunited with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very efficient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What meaning pander to the Palestinians and to give them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they give in their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run out of missiles at Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">Better keep them behind the wall and harshly suppress any attempts to raise his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, the hardliners prevail; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Though Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Defense part of the budget's more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire, is a good sign and it may mark the beginning of change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, not least, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the democratic change in Arab countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians ' right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later going to explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population is only compounding these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas, must pay the growing discontent of the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need in the external momentum</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, not too impressive in the short term, is the hope that the cease-fire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which is past time to make a decision to cut off the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote at the UN, the result of which can become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Its role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to solving this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Is a disastrously hopelessly myopic position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Australia came into force of the law on unified packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the dangers of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts in contrast are allocated on a damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in the world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replacing logos and colorful design of various brands tɪmbəɹ a box of the gloomy and olive color with the terrible images of affected body parts and images of children, whose health has been decimated smoking their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various images and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the wholesale, imposed a mandatory with this Saturday - the names of brands that printed the same fine print.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is the most severe in the world of the conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Australia's federal government declares that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basis for this decision provided the results of research, demonstrate that people, not began smoking until 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing research that performed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes are not especially affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of those measures are already considering and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import-module Pty Ltd, argues that demand for cigar case and silicone cases, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in the high court in Australia, where he tried to challenge the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Sandra ha, company Zico already implemented around six thousand products wholesale businesses and expects a new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among this is the part of the population, at these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the Australia series of laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sports events, as well as prohibiting retailers to sell cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot restrict in this foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the internet you find very attractive," explains Becki freeman phenomena, questions of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in such social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this is a matter of the hands of the average citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare time and effort and made the video, or is behind this advertising company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Australian branch of the company's British American Tobacco argues that in the industry now more busy adapting to the new rules, rather than advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries is insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WTO decision is expected by the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Tani plibersec, the government has discussed with the other countries the possibility of making them similar laws on packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia, ostentatiously not obey innovation.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures of me not graze.</seg>
<seg id="33">I just don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Simply drawing cigarette and hide pack in his pocket," explains Victor El Hague, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth of the pack.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, the only thing that could make me quit - this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James annual, Head of store tobacco King Of The Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task of installing the goods on the shelves</seg>
<seg id="37">"Before I have on unloading a new party went an hour, and now four hours," he complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government had to take and to ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's over, close shop," he says, vskidivaya hands up.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this day of thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft were mechanical problems and it replaced the other plane, which we and awaiting.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I have had enough time for reflection about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I'm not going to lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport in anticipation of flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, neither the iPhone nor even duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development are lobbying in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored not so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that probably contributes to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because in the modern world we all are constantly before any screen, the benefits of boredom walk past us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we need to strive to boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time, not.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will come back to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before I, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not so, argues Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary and the author of "fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Actually boredom can boast a very ancient history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This remains an open question about how we understand the tedium.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having studied the materials research on this topic and program-of question target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but cannot do so, that would give them the satisfaction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that man is not doing something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy do anything I don't want to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Main in experienced boredom, he says, it is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time is stretched slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, but people experiencing depression, see the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "unoccupied intelligence-a definition of boredom from the point of view of the attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives On psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants who listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud noises not relevant programming included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so their barely could understand, and the third group listened to only record the voices without any sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard TV with low volume, and noted that they were bored, often others found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this, and attributed it boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the university gvielpha, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting kind, "for example, studying the flow of products in the pipeline in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is considered, he continues, that when people start pokatchivat on a chair or paint scribble on a piece of paper, they do this from boredom, but we now know that in fact such actions simply help not relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and gardener learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight," says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we all feel the tedium: when delay in flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech presurvey uninteresting kind of film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But different people have different levels of propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s for measuring such individual features the researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">To determine the valuation on such a scale are questions and assertions, for example, "a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved" or "me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such questionnaires the researchers found that boys often bored girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, in general, teenagers in general often bored.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 Reed Larsson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he is contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents to eight times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they get bored in school and during the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">While only 3% of parents said that they get bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor larson notes that it has no data about how would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he knows that "on adolescence have the propensity to boredom, ” mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully solve than they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Go back to my original question: boredom useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes no, because in extreme manifestations it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in an effort to relieve boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich dedicated study this problem more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">But this same brain is not always knows what to do better.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you'll be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">However, if your child is missing and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom alone or as otherwise manage your time and employment, "said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"But such skills of independent regulation of the art in a variety of situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns to not only to occupy himself something, he also learns to control at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that boredom need to somehow praise.</seg>
<seg id="56">But considered her something bad, too, is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agree with this.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">It is unclear how it will apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, mouthwatering player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of the state of Colorado accused of committing criminal offences that will soon be completely lawfully throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamar and rode in the car on the prairies of near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came .Communication in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use, petty offences, for each of which have their fine in the amount of $100 - and the appointed date of the hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"With us are treated as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Criminal--that but does he?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small litigation depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already charged in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped charges to people 21 years of age and older for storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law comes into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases associated with marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from denver suburbs to the mountains of the West vote for something to prevent the emergence of in their places new, licensed state stores to sell marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All of this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. oates, police chief in the town of Aurora in the east from denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives from the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also ozadatcheno pochesivaut head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing of growing, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, is it good or bad, ahead of most other states in resolving issues use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In Colorado a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcohol in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can do more, admits Mr Smith than put forward any proposals and hope that it would work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, to which we could navigate," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill the state of Washington, called the I - 502, will enter into force on 6 December and for a whole year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of possession of marijuana has been institutionalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of "adequate access to licensed marijuana with a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and day-care centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is especially difficult it will be to place the licensed to trade marijuana in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingstone, a spokesman for the newly created by research group Centre of the legalization of marijuana. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November police chief oates from Aurora sent his employees an e-mail message that the city prosecutors will no longer attract individuals age 21, accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations "from this moment."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Police chief oates reported that the police will be enforced in the town of rules governing the activities of individuals, farmers marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug distributors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Prosecutor weld's role as the district in northern Colorado, Ken tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill he said that prosecutors will still involve responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users of its people undergo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently 119 individuals charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"The duty of our institutions is prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Reaction was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police Grand junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of a small amount of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="30">District attorney Pete hauttsinger supported that decision, but also decided not to take accusations on already open cases related to custody of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that enforce the law until he won't change is our direct responsibility," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, which took part in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of marijuana use for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">But contradictory reaction of residents in different places drakino denuded ambiguity relations between the local authorities of the state to experiment with marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The county prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Shawn makalister floor lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the national organization for reform of laws on marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They sought for so long people for this is that now can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - the first states in which to a small number of marijuana are the same as to alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously await instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider a sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of legalizing marijuana hope that the justice department to give in on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several have received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave welcome to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and the 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Bureau agents to combat drug is unlikely to rush into the house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they hardly become blind eye to regulated state government shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so would not have been able to open up sooner than a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Bahrain, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration by the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which apparently will be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to be in this position that we will issue the license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and those that voted for the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">Remains still a lot of outstanding issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">Persecution of university students for their views began not today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">How much I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world of educational institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, the two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of training on the historic Sartayev vusterscogo college at Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, which led to the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father did not survive and burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends were get confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">Newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college, because I didn't like it that my classmates have sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from Ščerbatihs cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In fact, it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not because of my fairly unusual name or that I attended a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hounded me for only one reason, and in this glorious the cradle of the enlightenment it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a follower of conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why should remember about this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students that follows center-right views, is exposed to the same highbrow-baiting.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students - conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that which is available to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to introduce to the committee on the equal rights of the college an additional representative, to ensure that freedom of expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation only exacerbated released recently on BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment "land of wonders: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives introduced eccentric and neo-nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the film was shown Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, which travels in Rolls-Royce Royce, wears a silver suit and stick with silver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities students - conservatives complain that of them makes "scapegoats because of rising school fees."</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke black, 20 years, the vice president of the association of conservatives magnetic, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in a university environment increases distortion in the direction of the left.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people who we don't even know, believe us with impunity arrogant and unruly children of rich parents. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College, in which was filed the petition on strengthening protection, calls such an atmosphere a comfortless, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, said that the ratio of the student club to host of center-right views worsened considerably.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life of the club members," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came back in September 1986, timid and shy eighteen girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford unrepentant from hatred of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="30">The year before the university vote deprived former a student Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of a reduction in the budget for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that awaited me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through his fingers at a hunt students - conservatives, but will gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and disagreement government apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – penetrated through the wood panelling walls trimmed with audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first seminar I had to translate French text of the eighteenth century in English, and I was not prepared for what followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was given me with difficulty, I hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like a cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Tatcheristi fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students zahihicali.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes were full of tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise you to take a few basic lessons of the French in their free time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probruzzal Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room is absolutely miserable.</seg>
<seg id="44">That evening in the college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, a second-year student in the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of Conservative university.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said a friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> "Unfortunately, it is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Over every person suspected of sympathies conservatives, will get.</seg>
<seg id="49">I myself not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most freshmen and conservatives pretend that they are Labour. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, I am too cowardly to hypocritical.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that did not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">First-year philosophy, politics and economics, which he studied at Eton, said: "you're the daughter of a fascist pigs.</seg>
<seg id="55">You contagious. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students 3g-hatched his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was a morose, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> "They beat each other, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">Will I be forced to become a Labor and hide their true beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">The upcoming me three years, began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">His hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on issues of foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he practically not appeared.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for personal remoteness, pettiness and commitment to Marxists determinist view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you won't be happy," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I travelled to Oxford from the parental home in London, seeking refuge with relatives and impartial nablyudately friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the cause.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not believe them.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in 1940 there were any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best university in the world," he said in a dismal manner.</seg>
<seg id="76"> Is there for this are not able to, only not in the city of dreaming spires.</seg>

<seg id="79">"Not take a hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that this is just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You break my heart, if left university. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was iznurena regular trips to London and my emotional defense ultimately collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a conservative, was unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The next week at the seminar, when another teacher history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the soul burning from shame, I confessed that "I washed with brains parents," and called them "old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time he wrote every week on two columns for newspapers belong rupert murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I could not get out, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I picked up a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I and not returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">Can call me and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.</seg>
<seg id="95">The sadder that this was Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers Tories, but to this day is behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="6">Otcolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on the shoulders and carries them upstairs to a precipitous rocky road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, the height of which $947 meters, just 250 metres, but Matt the required more than 40 minutes to climb at a snail's pace, with difficulty keeping his balance and carefully the road to not ostupit and not fall over the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong step could cost him his life, as happened to one visitor from France, which started a few years ago with gravine cavah - ijene.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners with cavah - ijene earn 5 euro cent for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, they pave a road between the tourists that their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is about PT-group candy ngrimbi, company, which operates from 1960, the volcano, and better and not to say, of its employees, which it pays 21,220,774 Indonesian rupiah (euro) for every kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells over 10,000 rupees ($83) of euro petrochemical industries, because this mineral common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As the norm is perenoska 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each hodcu," explains to us Anto, which usually performs three daily carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and in the end, feels broken, but they allow it to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems next to nothing for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Day riga-skirotava miners very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the, who earlier was a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in banuvangi, a town near the volcano, for the good reason that in Indonesia is as overwhelming as serrats: "I married a girl from Bali, where some hindus, and brought her on Jawa, she had converted to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">ANTO have asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years Anto spent three years, risking a cavah - ijene, serrats which has already started to affect on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates a volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that he must pay for achieving their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Work for another two years, because I would like to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises a more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">If life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he performs work anyway.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dividing dirty wooden hut with other one, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because serrats not ceased to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and glitters in the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating way a small lantern, connects to his helmet, which he bought for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters drag basket with gray on his shoulders from the bottom of a volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite high profits, the mining company will not mechanized production of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment baggers who work on their own account and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they do not receive even parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for shooting, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people - mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work for cattle, not for the people," says badrusin, stocky one of 42 years, who spent on cavah - ijene three decades, since he left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that will endure the job "as much as you can, ” because he needs money for the education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Not go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although serrats burning throat and eye burns when the wind suddenly changing and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders that become deformed under the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing a basket on his back, now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his comrades get 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in tamansari, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers along a narrow path after.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Don't go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says, opening his mouth, which is missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also runs carrier of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but poverty kokoshniki from generation to generation of one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do the human mules with cavah - ijene.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">It might seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising mints loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local saying such as "let's suppose Bao (Bulku) in sight" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH's, enshrines the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to the issue in the entertainment form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to people Yuzharlanneft "their national debt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We reproduce the worst in the world by a similar, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government tried to do much, for example, carry out the launch of spirits with pheromones or arrange zergling dating (blitz-session visits).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 the child</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who does not take it so lightly, so this is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends $1,300 a year on policies for the enthusiasm of citizens to the birth of a greater number of children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for couples and parents, provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extend maternity leave and provides tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has a low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech state is a city in south-east Asia, also known for conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore, according to his national management of the population, is currently at level 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution – in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang weia min, director of policy for couples and families of the national population, says that the reason the "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"It's allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and creating a family," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms, help increase the number of bachelor and postponement of marriage and the birth of her children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration also is seen as one reason that last year Singapore's ruling party has received the worst result in the elections since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the elections was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in fertility has known the impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is making efforts to not built so much a small housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Guidance on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which you can build in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments area of 46 square meters very well sold.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote idle lifestyle and deprive incentive for developers who want to build a big family housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Bezdolny sun, general director of the firm's been El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" sold much faster than the more spacious Czorsztynski.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give a more clear guidelines for developers, who earlier put tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Much too perenapryazennye</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city and the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of an increase in the national birth rate, after speaking with singapurcami who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very overcommitted, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people it is a delay," says a young manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women cite his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that make it hard for kids.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, how would the government nor to encourage its citizens to birth children, in terms of the chances, the final word rests with singapurcami.</seg>

<seg id="8">In four cases, they are associated with the term "something very my," in a private plane, and "password and username" when applied it to social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My greatest secrets I would not load in the post," says Jorge a decade, when trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he argues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On FB I load beautiful images or pictures from the games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also, I play with their friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I would not have shared a photo that is not my, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">Boy realizes that bad publish obscene photographs of naked people, crime or write abusive or violent comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge assures that knows 35 friends, who in his FB, and its nine folloverov on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of them relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mother in the know, it does have the password to one of the accounts.</seg>

<seg id="21">Without thinking, replies that never would have accepted a request from an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wouldn't be with someone who might have recommended the stranger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">This teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter recognises that't know 20 people, added to his list of friends.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, our English and a specialist in the education and training, believes that to direct children and teenagers need to understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras indicates that Turpion Mark prenski, master of pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the labor digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">Digital natives that they, children and young people who were born in an age of technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Explains that this topic is difficult, "because we have them ask to have a certain criterion what you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, at the age when adulthood.and not enough for this."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to specialist, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, "ask questions that make them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them that they didn't do this, is useless," she adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras lists some of the options: there are things that you would have told a stranger, so why should you do it online?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like those published you about your friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know that others publish about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you sign party photos, did you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And another, all whether you need to know, what are you doing in each moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another item is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rules one and the same.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Beyond the internet a man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same must be in social networks," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The vigilance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Astuardo guardia CUEF lecturor, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for family heads christ.12 read the policy of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">Understanding each of the items, they have good reasons to talk with children about the preconditions for the opening of the account online.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">"South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship: Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the aim, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who took part in the presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), being held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they're practically one otechestvo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He defended, in this context, the project of establishing di-vorce citizenship, who approve of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but still there is a reactionary sector who want to bring us back to the past," he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact San Jose about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, south americans, on the contrary, the sign all.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, alluding to political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that does not regret that decision, because with him he had betrayed his principles, and comply with its "deepest values of democracy and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that in his time "there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish law considers possible to do it via video conference, which could make from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I haven't spoken with him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador, I reported that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian head of state.</seg>

<seg id="15">"It affects the health of any person," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London about finding solutions to the problems confined the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We don't negotiate about human rights, it is a word we in this case do not use, but there were constant debate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzon, leads a number of processes in different European authorities," mentioned it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And said that "if the United Kingdom tomorrow give a guarantee of immunity, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases, by senor Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or by him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Mortality from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It stunned me," he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of a doctor, moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy hid it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Deciding to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn more about it as much as possible.... and his efforts frustrated - he has already said his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients HIV fendou hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (hc.gamer), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was already 22 years in the early 90s it would be hard to believe - too little then existed treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those times have AIDS was the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and to do this, not worsening quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, so far, many people come, when the virus is already damaged, drained their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, "a great achievement for the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV fendou hc.gamer, Jaime andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy of those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when it is reported about 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To assess this progress, we should remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today at an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report from UNAIDS), it's also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Us only in 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; however, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "Why still have the deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I imagine this myself, so the things in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about his cabir.i condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He led the crushing data: "nine out of ten patients come, when already have some opportunistic infection; that we need to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who asked for it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In his proposal to agree experts and officials of the state council for preventing AIDS in us (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to check into a private lab, motivated only by the fact that it made him a friend and, despite his young age, he was already in a phase of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma Kaposi, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that will die, and don't want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Time will still die, the better I'll be nadirat three times a week," they say, but not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, taking an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, to bother about yourself and about another man," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with Milenio Jalisco to prompt his statement of those who now, in the context of a World AIDS Day, is experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let checked, if there was a risk of infection, as soon as possible to let them know whether they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other man, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is his message said "the fight against AIDS in this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The counter condoms</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big gap between programs in health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara that handled problem with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, devoted to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, we now offer packages of 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now so far has no access to the condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why would they do?" it's a popular question, with ehidstv and condemnation, from the social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured propagandist.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for function and to hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often attends youth.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">We're not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether the possible distribution of condoms under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It's not sexy, it is best to make condoms available for those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key data us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Registered 13,435 summary cases (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state ranks 4th in the national rankings on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the infections are related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to perinathal way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as in one known case of there from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The avid basketball traveler Hector hetin Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, have been all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector hetin Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And before a brain haemorrhage becoming him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of the smaller categories, a player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and the head of BSN with cowboy bayamonu and president of basketball federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did a lot of roles in basketball, throughout his life, including several at the same time, like when I was president BSN, director general of the national team and the president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in the Primera Hora bayamonu, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes is not exaggerating, making this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his home, almost all with photographs and memorable things, collected for his long way, show about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Heart bayamonu in</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With big emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the cowboys, since the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when the age of 15 years, his performance in the role of an agent or agent contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships cowboys since 1967, as an agent, with the agent or manager.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, the year the debut jerome Minsi in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the moment and will continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, which was a great administrator, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that gin Bartov, who went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, rising 6 '7."</seg>
<seg id="16">"You want to?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended that sniper Raymond Gausse-Kruger, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship bayamonu, gauss would have helped win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Chempionstv cowboys with gauss I admired, but already at a distance, because to 1988, already was the head of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsi in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remember how we won for the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup 1990, in which we have got fourth place and this was to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, which made us beat the final game, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team with the World Cup in 1990, is the best team, what you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She is among the best, like the one that won the Dream Team in the Olympics of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the one that plays pan-americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the national team the US, which was quite similar to the one that we have won bronze at the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and piculina (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) Tonito colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Quixote Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a greater joy, was a team of Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995, a protester, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">Role players like Canito nievesa, Pablo Alice and young Rolando hurruitnera vzamin players, temporarily estranged for the mess in Inter-American Chempianat Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, this was piculina Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His performance in international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has not dominated at this level, as did piculina.</seg>
<seg id="34">And that is without taking into account his career in various leagues, in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best puertoricancem movements-in?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very complicated question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From young, I really like the work Leo arilly.</seg>

<seg id="1">The course, which explores "the end of the world"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, students explore the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In this semester, when religion professor Stuart sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that had irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" the Maya calendar, 21 December, for which many people jumped as for proof that heralded the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But fashion had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call dolgoarmageddon, and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian theorists end times believe that the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said fashion this week, students at Rutgers university - Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If you analyze what is happening in the world at present, as if we have just 30 days, it was a really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the latest in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In templsk University associate professor Barry vacer reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze why these ideas eventually apply," he said, and the way in which a hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, could hit the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell students that, possibly, probably, plausible and impossible," said vacer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is simply called “the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We are not adding '2012', to always be able to read the course once again, in case the end of the world will not come," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "imminent destruction, ” students should learn, to prepare projects and take final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students with no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses have proved quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Places ended in two hours," said Restall about its course for students with the highest average scores, which recorded 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We received e-mail for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, is there still space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I like to watch that humans do, to console themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23 year-old student separation of religion and sociology from haddonfilda, New Jersey, in Rutgers - Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or his absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will vecesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I never heard about the course, which would be taught this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Me he likes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor is not said that he believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project touched prophecy of Maya, and in some ways we his discredited," said Julie zeglen, 21 year-old student the last course in templsk University of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to the changes around them, predicted the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The internet has caused an increase in these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other places people don't think about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">In cleam the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question about whether he knew about some informed about "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the disposal of the appeal court.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall noticed that for a long time the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some said that they are going to go to parties "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Maybe call someone from friends to get together, laugh," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old connection.</seg>
