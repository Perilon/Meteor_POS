A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Republicans leaders condoned their policy by the need to combat election fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, the Brennan Centre as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Moreover, Republicans lawyers have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In this sense, these measures will undermine, in part, the American democratic system.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments passed from 2009 new laws making the process more difficult to register or vote.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections which saw add new 675 Republican representatives in 26 states.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year 2011.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new electoral laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Moreover, these laws also reduce periods of polls, invalidate the right to register as a voter polling day and withdraw citizens with a judicial file their right to vote.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo identification card.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The republican authorities clamoured to extend this practice to other states.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card as the map of health insurance.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency of their state.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, it often costs more than $100 for the ID card required.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
The new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and low-income people.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have the ID card required photo.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Much more.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Students, voters considered more voting for the Democrat candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
However, these same states allow members of clubs fishing or hunting who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
For example, during the 2004 general election, the campaigns of voter registration contributed to save about 10 million citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have resulted in a decline in the rate of 17% registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of polls.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
For example, during the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It was the same with Hispanics.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In return, the white formando 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of the electorate voting in advance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters objected vigorously to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes Democratic governors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
They were able to limit the damage.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will definitely make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Democrats critical denounce the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see this as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 necessary votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
In this sense, these measures will undermine, in part, the American democratic system.

Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
What do even more reluctant men already reluctant to undergo screening tests.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Pass the test or not?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and firm recommendations.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another study, European found a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who do not have.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
The study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastasis if we are not detected.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from 40 years if there is a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
We really need to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Today, many men who detects cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We will suggest to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Increasingly, we can accurately determine the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I therefore recommend still pass the test.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether it should go or not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Disease prevention
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Unfortunately there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"If no one smokes, the rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Several also remain totally unexplained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is also a risk factor for several others.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
This is highly detrimental to people's health.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the spokesman André Beaulieu.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer halved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weight
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"Research shows that regular physical activity during a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Food
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Too much, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Deli meats, and they should be avoided.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
The conservation of meat by smoking, curing or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Vitamins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Their research is inconclusive at this time.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
"A screening test, it is not cancer."

The dehulled Higgs boson
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is believed that boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least worst" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the material - but has not yet been empirically observed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure whether the Higgs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs predicted by the standard model.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physical, Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be perfectly clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong appear slim, and see what it is.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you are going to hurt you.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles may not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In a corner, there are good fermions appointed citizens, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And in another move bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, that we do not discuss, and "force particles", by which the large forces of nature spread and the Higgs boson is somehow related.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
These bosons, it must be stressed here, not all are also exotic bugs as one might think.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this precise location, a bit like a stone thrown in a pond.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This "disturbance" born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore a boson "with force."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
More stable field
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
It is the same with the Higgs boson, the difference is that this is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" boson appears.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, there is very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock could ride the surface.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator as CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km circonférence! - to achieve such energies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
These are not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never himself on a fridge.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Now, what is "can bring" all this research, Ms. Plamondon request?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of MS.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
They are also more earnestly hoped that, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes Model.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The latter, it must be said, still has a huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which form about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-oops!).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
But it has found no such differences at CERN to date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Impact
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The implications of this research in the daily and the world, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Hold: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell Laboratories, does not suspected the revolution that their work would trigger.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing else.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself has developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, initially the laser was seen as a "gadget lab."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Imagine...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation that surrounds the research.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, during its work.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
This sensor, although it was not his original intention, is now "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...

Problem of access to palliative care

</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, hospital or nursing home.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
And several agencies, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative care home Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
It is precisely this great deficiency in the health care québecois fear that several physicians specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.

<seg id="49">
Since October, signed a manifesto of luminaries of palliative care that Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.

According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to euthanasia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency room, large pain, without the necessary to relieve.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And at the same time, several oncologists is stalking their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The survival hopes of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
When I announced to my oncologist that I would have the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stop to beat me, " she said.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
However, she told me that I was finished.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Not all-powerful care
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thanked caregivers not to have complied with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
But it must be said that the palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of palliative care home Greater Montreal, patients would be reluctant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which amounts to hijack the patient until his death, sporadically, permanently.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
</seg>
<seg id="65">
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you euthanasiiez" means "I want to be relieved."

Real major scandals in Quebec
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Officials of the roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know of a "formidable" system, the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"Industry", which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.

<p>
<seg id="4">
" It is curious as the system crumbles since it took the major means ", " says Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is thus that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through an investigation on embezzlement related to road work contracts in Quebec, in which the liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had agreed that backwards.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The "report" Duchesneau established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and bribery of officials.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he says, the Department of Transportation would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some réfrénant their instincts to receive a share.

In recent weeks, it has conducted searches in series and laid charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the Committee on the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Himself has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia, which reversait money to Union Montreal Mayor Gerald Tremblay of the party.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Mr zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
He also admitted he had organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister liberal, Normandeau.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was functioning smoothly.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer public work, has detailed before the committee: in ten years, he has received from construction companies of gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling 736000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts which it inflated costs.

<p>

Other officials region.nsf admitted being smear by inflating 30% to 40% invoices, false extras.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Then an organizer of the party's mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay accused of having deliberately closed their eyes on a parallel budget fueling its coffers with dirty money.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal to sound the alarm.
</seg>

<seg id="30">
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is in the process of cleaning the wound but there should be a unit own investigation in Montreal and a watch, not to see the dubious practices.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
As they cleaned.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Regularly.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the "role of elected officials aware of the scheme," when they do not soaking in the politicking!
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Believing the 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "they told me that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to $100, but this will not change the situation, he said: "as long as it will not limit strictly election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
</seg>
<seg id="37">
He advocates a complete review of the system for granting public contracts and financing parties: "you can't go lower; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."

"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
How do you explain this progression?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GMP.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Great players arrived.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Every day, I progressed to their side.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And, in the match, it is easier.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Everything is going very quickly in football.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But I do not ignite.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
My debut at the centre of preformation IFN Clairefontaine in my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always put forward by levels.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
You therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Recruits this summer are accustomed to play games at a very high level.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They also know that every training is crucial.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
What makes a player like me want to cope and provide the maximum.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Ancelotti is the man for the job?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of course.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with posh clubs.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He has worked with great players.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I think it will win other titles in Paris.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
I was running a series of injuries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The confidence it gives me also explains my performance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
How do you on the first part of the season?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
But we remain in ambush.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the finals 8th with the way.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Now, anything can happen.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Firstly, we want to finish first in our pool, before Porto, in order to receive during the 8th of final return.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
PSG can become a great European club in the short term?
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He already has the budget...
</seg>
<seg id="40">
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Today, this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Financially, PSG provides the means to make this happen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
In Ligue 1, does not win the title, as the last season, would be a big failure?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This year, it was truly committed to pocket the champion.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Last season, it is not gone far.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
It has been a very big season.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We finished with 79 points.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be champion...
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
This year, I think it is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Do you think that the media wait too MTP?
</seg>
<seg id="55">
It is normal that you expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and players that we have.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We fully accept.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
After that, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to blame us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
One wonders what people expect more.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It is not the FC Barcelona!
</seg>
<seg id="61">
We are trying to implement a project.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
A team is built over time.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
It has been shown in the Champions League could be present.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Look at Manchester City that does not happen, the last two seasons, to qualify for the finals 8th, they also made huge spending!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
In the light of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were " inspired by this new GMP.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevailed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
All the better to say that there is a "Zlatan dependence."
</seg>
<seg id="72">
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
It is time for it and it proves that he is the star of the League 1.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
He has shown wherever he went that he was a great player, a global star.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Within the group, the man and the player.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
He also respects the men he has around him.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
What he has done is truly exceptional.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
This prompts others to raise their level of play.

<seg id="83">
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from cherrypicking game time.

<p>

It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
As Laurent Blanc was.
</seg>
<seg id="93">
But I do not want to make comparison.
</seg>
<seg id="94">

With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks

The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between stakeholders.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to financial crises.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
About 200000 transactions have already been registered through 15000 computers on the network.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A small websites thousand accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (classes are identified on the site bitcoincharts.com).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
She described bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the most successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as "credits", used to make progress in a video game win by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But each time a central authority and control deals exchanges.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers, and buyers and sellers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Does it work?
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Each transaction between two users actually happens between two electronic addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual key encryption.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of public accounts, distributed across the network.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is a phase of hash file, that is to say transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique digital footprint.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"Computers are" the new transaction and add a number before "chop".
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The aim is to find the number which gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Once found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The transaction is indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - another orphan remaining because the two have different fingerprints.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The computer has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until 100 millionth, leaving the margin...
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The challenge is also raised to each increase in computing power.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and deposits bitcoins in stolen.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"The fault used is not the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The ECB also identifies opportunities for money laundering through this anonymous service.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
But the cash also owns this defect.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Actors weight as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins not run.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In November, "giants" balances were launched.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins gold.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Pierre Noizat, author of a book teaching on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and cheaper.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
The system is easy to implement merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
It is enough to provide an address that a telephone can "photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, which provides thousands of users.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
There is a general movement questioning the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.

Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister who has existed since the 1964 constitution.

A Constitution forceps in Egypt
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
It is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
While Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play its will.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months to this House to finish its work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a draft text, repeatedly amended which weakens institutional stability and led to legal entanglements.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For his opponents, President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "betray his word" and "trampling the law."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a way to end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A very short period of time which obliges the Brotherhood to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
For President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute is raging across the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
As the use of a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: ' Either you vote for my text, I keep full powers ", supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Most of the Liberals were missing.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they have not been able to express their views.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So that the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, have been added hastily, yesterday morning.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were adopted.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Commentators are amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... prayer times, some members of the committee considering that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was poorly regulated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The text, which was still be voted yesterday evening, 234 articles.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Objects of attention, Article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" by the "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"Hypocrisy," meet the Liberals, who see it as a communication.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Because they believe the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They include Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify compliance with Sharia law.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier, that is worrying because " people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Fears of Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
" At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian state.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not intellectuals but academics, some trained in the French system " tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But he acknowledged that " there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the words borrowed religious vocabulary.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It refers to the "fiqh" including [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
</seg>
<seg id="38">
And the question in the future could be asked to what extent of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are greatly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Another contentious point: the powers granted to the army.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Defence Council.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Neither the trial will be prohibited from civilians in military courts, as requested by the human rights associations.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
These are also concerns about the text, they deem liberticidal.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In addition, no article more echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
While the Egyptian president was to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
The support of the head of state, will march Saturday.

"That language in Moscow will": migrants save money to learn the language

While MPs and human rights activists polémiquent on what the law will give on the mandatory language test, fraudsters selling " false certificates have already emerged in the country

<p>
<seg id="3">
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.

<seg id="5">
Their sole purpose: to earn money to help their families back home.

<p>
<seg id="6">
Since 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For the moment, this rule only affects those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and retail.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
However, over time, promises the federal migration service, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.

The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of the peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in cities across the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.

This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.

But before the law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it is going to give?

<seg id="18">
What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Firstly, meet representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "slave labour".
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The protection of the rights must begin before their departure.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Only a system of organised selection will resolve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to croiser dishonest people who, under the pretext of help him will provide a "trip" in a crowded house where he and dozens of its similar tourmenteront for months without food and paperless and will work between 12 and 14 hours a day.

This, of course, is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair.

The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carrying civilian weapons.

This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether shooting at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths.

According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in policing while 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.

"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," explains Baranets.

The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the forces of law and order.

In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will grow or run out of steam quickly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations left.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In addition to increased modest salaries that employees receive basic at Walmart and fast food chains, event organisers want the creation of unions.

The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "black Friday", when a barrage of balances rain seizing million inhabitants has befallen America and sometimes triggering clashes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
That day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs in the world of 2.2 million people have left their position to organize picketings with unions and activists left in stores the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
That is why many poorly paid workers at Walmart shop solely on their workplace.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The price and the choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products in particular because of the low salaries of its employees.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
They also complain of difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Participants of the events of "black Friday" demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
For the employee base at Walmart affecting 9.5 per hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Scientists from the University of California Berkeley show that if Walmart increased the average salary of $12 an hour, it would cost the group 3.2 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
If Walmart transferred any wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store them would amount to 46 cents.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and have no prejudice to the group.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The "black Friday" continued in the stores of the evening at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold 5000 articles on this period in the second.

The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30.00 a.m. near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks fast-food are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the current minimum wage.

They also sought to set up unions in the fast-food sector.

Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to collect augmented reality through special glasses.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Initially, it is Google, which this summer unveiled its current model at its annual conference and in November it was revealed that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
However, it is clear from the interview with the group's director of interactive 3D technologies of Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of this company, the glasses are already history.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, through the creation of virtual open spaces.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
- Could you say a few words what your research group?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the frontiers of this interaction.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Humanity as a whole remained at the moment the pixels on flat screen and sometimes in touch.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.

<p>
<seg id="12">
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things are happening on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We are trying to change that and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D operating on different technologies, including the projection technologies.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We must move the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
For this, however, we must not only identify the user, but also the space around it.

<seg id="17">
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.

We cannot say that this is the panacea: the confidentiality question arises because we did not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.

<seg id="22">
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discreet, small gestures.

The gestures were not caught by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.

In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + voice.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
- It is to say?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
- For example, how I would you spend this spool?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
You would speak and with gestures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
- Normally, I only speak.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
- Oh, it is going to be difficult to recognize.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual reconciliation.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
- If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you do not like in the modern cameras?
</seg>
<seg id="37">
They lack of resolution, depth or something else?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It would naturally get approximately 8-megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c/s.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
But the problem is not the Megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Compared to the latter, all current technologies are good enough, it adds labour designers algorithms.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
We must bear in mind the resolution X and Y, but also Z.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Speed also is very important, the number of executives in the second.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Humans movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/o do not really, especially for the gestures.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond has given the touch sensors a regular delay treatment between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
I would have needed a device of this type in my work, but not requiring, for more frames per second.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- But should not increase the number of cameras?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
- The Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
And the third camera is a usual sensor field visible.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
It is not used to define the depth of the subject.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Many cameras could solve this problem...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, playing with the curve cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
</seg>

- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
- Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" reality that you would from a platform cloud of glasses to the smartphone.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The glasses are a very personal device and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Imagine that manipulation of holographic virtual objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
There is a problem that opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
</seg>
<seg id="61">
The hands feel nothing!
</seg>
<seg id="62">
What answers your group prepare compared to this challenge?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand for support.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It is perfectly pressure!
</seg>
<seg id="67">
But there are also technologies that are really designed to assign the palpabilité to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays routed to a point where the finger and that gives you the feeling at the moment still weak, a breath of fresh air on the tips of their fingers.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
There is also the bracelets worn on the wrist that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also an axis of work prospects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
So it feels it should normally feel when he sees something?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
- That is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
There is still a task on which it will take a long time to kowtow: how to believe in someone who is physically in a very small space that it works in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
For the moment, it is moderately to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
"Rosbalt" continues the project "the Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to urban dwellers who are at the forefront of culture and art.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors in the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the outgoing painter Kirill Miller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, wearing red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, Summer Garden and parties and openings.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The tables of Kirill Miller always bring crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It is one of the storytellers St. Petersburg fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance is smiling people and puts them in a good mood.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had enough matured for this difficult role through its existence, its philosophy and its image as a bohemian.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
- Kirill, why do you go about the city while red and yellow or turquoise, for example?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
I have chosen the red as designer specializing in appearance and image.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Although in society, everything that is not grey raises aggression and a negative agitation.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But my provocations are intended to initiate the discussion.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
- And when you understand that you had to be painter?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
- At the exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I understood that it was my path.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Then, the wave of old unofficial painters was gone and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I started to tie my friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was more vague.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except for the words.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
- And it ended up in your artistic Clinique... it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of Saint Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In 1995, I was seated in Pushkinskaya-10 Schützenmuseum before the work a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, home of the Petersburg bohemian.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Many were born: NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I can still see Chnour arrive with the project "the ear of Van Gogh."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Chnour and his friends sang songs easy for playback in skinny suits, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the group began to occur in live, it became "Leningrad".
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Trakhtenberg drove a lot of emissions before Hali Gali.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We have given their Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is here that it has received.
</seg>

"D137 clowns," Club "Griboedov": the impact of the artistic Clinic.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Our employees are parties as accustomed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price "personalities of our city."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I was named "artist of the year", and that is when my reign ended.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It is not convenient to work in a new era with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
- Your work is characterised by a recognizable style.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currency and acuity.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I will have an exhibit "the Russian museum through the clowns."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Before I was someone from social, today it hurts and it is scary to be that way.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
But with the clowns, fades, the tragic falls.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
For example, the idea of saving the world via the total disguise and mandatory.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Today, it is the dress that is important, it is interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Perhaps that we cannot give him a hand, but rather they spit in the tronche.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Who else can play.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
- But perhaps the commercial art can also be beautiful?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
A disintegration of culture is happening.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Before, people were shared in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the corny.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is hard to please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Today, we need to think about who you are going.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Each features 100 fans.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
- But many thousands of people come to see Stas by!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- These are people that were thrown to come see, it is the sexual and social side that works.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not and ultimately it is less management, money, everything is dying.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I started with the tables which usually are those painted at the end of life.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
Today, it often confuses ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
We say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely to paint.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
I am for this culture.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

- Kirill, what is lacking in St. Petersburg?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
- Good cultural experts.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
There is this concept: the official culture.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But not everyone can work in culture.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
Under the reign of good Tsars, it wasn't like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
In Moscow, today there are good consultants.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts who correctly assess these experts and their fraieront a path.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" which blooms.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say they do not take any contemporary art, that there are painters who need to find other museums.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
- For you, what is it is St. Petersburg?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
St. Petersburg - is not the cultural capital, Moscow has far more culture, there is a ground for this.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
And our stones, art is struggling to grow.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it is bad.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
In Europe, there are many curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
For us, this layer is very fine.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
We must make the art fashionable as was the case at the beginning of the last century.

In a word, if the child just born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.

<p>
<seg id="59">
In weightlessness, the belly muscles, basin atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.

Of course we can prepare a baby in a special room, the woman will get him out.

Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls; so is permitted or prohibited?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect to demand respect for the law," said Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the laws were compared in procurement of these two countries.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
What was it concretely?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
It is a parallel control that we launched about two years.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national laws and an actual practice it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
We gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better," nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice itself is better in Germany.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
What this project can help you in practice and what does it mean to you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
A common control of this type should contribute to this we stopped to try to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But by lowering the threshold of markets, we will not achieve this goal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will be much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
You talk about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
How does the control system in Germany?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Is there a similar institution in our SAIs or a different mode of organisation?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
In terms of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof is similarly organized, it also has a board comprising a bit differently, but these two institutions are basically in a similar manner.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has also over the accounts of this type in the Länder.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The HRB can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled at the level of accounts over the Länder.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
With regard to national legislation, is simpler than ours?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
However, it is also true that this country that we consider a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has yet to impact on our operations control.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
As we make a posteriori controls, there is a delay.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Our observations are only for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "risk detection of mismanagement" with which we have vetted nearly 14000 procurement - these changes of course will be felt, because the thresholds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The problem that can arise is that these rules will become more severe and that it is not possible to meet them.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (for example, the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) Gazan controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
No, not in this way, I think.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
So what is the solution to cope?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Look at where we are not going to.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does it mean?
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The system Švarc is prohibited or allowed?
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
It may declare: "we are going to change the law and allow the", but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities, precisely in order to protect the tender.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated only for formal defects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is missing here.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It is only one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love down.

In addition, you get in December a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Can you describe in greater detail the project to our readers?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
It is a charitable action that we are preparing for two years.

<seg id="8">
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21, at 11.00 10.

Initially I think it was my idea, then we have developed with our creator, Honza Augusta.

Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to set, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.

To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible for disabled people and we are working to achieve within the framework of the Jedlička institute, with the Tap association, and for six years.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Teachers regularly visit with students of the Institute Jedličkův and propose activities that interest them and play.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.

</seg>
<seg id="31">
According to what criteria, have you chosen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
For example, in Prague, will perform on Chinaski, Support, Illustratosphere Lesbiens with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.

Prepare yourself to other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; again, we will prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We would also like to play the next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.

<p>
<seg id="38">
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of disabled people.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your touring?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
It is not so terrible that it looks at first sight.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
We have five members in electric chair whose gear must travel in the hold, naturally we trimbalons also a lot of baggage and instruments boxes....
</seg>
<seg id="43">
So far everything is always more or less well, CSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
What were your experiences so far?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that all is still in an initial phase.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only in electric chair in the centre of the city.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
They do not yet see as evidence to give priority to a person in an elevator.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Fortunately, there also, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
There is a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in the public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum anywhere...
</seg>
<seg id="55">
This is not very often where a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather instead at the cutting edge!
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Respect for the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong desire.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, that is what led in 1998 to create this group?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
I started to work as an educator at the Jedlička institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And as I myself am musician (I plays, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič said, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The success came only in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
It is true, the fact of creating links with known singers and actively promoting the group has helped us.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can also allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Did you aim to achieve such a high level with The Tap Tap?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
Show business is full of tricks that copy from each other.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
In some ways, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
Rare are the original projects, and I daresay that Tap Tap is one of them.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
These are people who can live a life of its own and flourish, provided the necessary means, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I often say that when people with disabilities arrive to achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
Is that your success is not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">
If we want to do good work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require a certain discipline.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
But I think it is quite normal.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realise that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve objectives.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
How many of them were already there in 1998?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We are an open group, people come and go, we can do nothing.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">
It will be the case the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 9.00 p.m.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena in Brno to Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when sung together the song of The Tap Tap "end of the world cancelled."

Poland and the cosmos.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Poland had begun working closely with the ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of projects of the agency.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The road to Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Already before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they did not meet always understanding.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I would like to mention, for example, the conference A. Šternfeld the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas from his book avant-garde entitled "introduction to cosmonautics."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr Jan Gadomski was attracted to its work.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "introduction to cosmonautics."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagator of astronomy and space travel.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Gadomski became a propagator of cosmonautics of world renown, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the Far Side of the Moon.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
From 1925 was built in Poland a speeder intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The problem is that neither the author nor the details of this project.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used to propel or curb the speeder.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The only information known about this speeder are those of the press at the time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to rockets.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The search was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is clear from the documents kept that research had reached the trial stage.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research stalled.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In 1937, plans a rocket hunting photoelectric, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
These two projects were directed a military use of rocket engines.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Just before the war, all projects using the technique of rockets were conducted by the provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated all work.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The council was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to astronavigation Polish society (our Polskie Astronautyczne).
</seg>
<seg id="25">
For the first time, it is a question of a society in the November issue of 1954's Problem newspaper, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronavigation
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had for the future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
At the beginning of the year 1956, Polish society astronavigation (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
He retained his position until his death in 1959.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
From 1956, the ATP brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta weather rocket Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
This rocket with a range of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Subsequently was built an improved version, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the rocket two-storey MR-2 were launched in the desert Bledov.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - MR rocket-34 ought to have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind aloft.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The Meteor rocket-1 development during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first type of rockets.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Three models (called Meteor-1A, 1B and --1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The maximum scope of all of these types of gear was 37 km.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first test flight began in October 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The Meteor rocket-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Subsequently were built the Meteor-2H versions and Meteor-3.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Under the program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.

The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public utility work.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This decision has raised in the public discussion.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a wider perspective.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The economic systems oriented liberalism, in both the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
This means that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (unlimited) private capital ally to a rampant financial speculation.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The considerable differences in the price of work (salaries) generate tension on prices.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It should be put under the significance this term: a producer tries by the importation of goods sold cheaply to resist economic competition by "making it more expensive" the price of competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy low-priced, disappear, and the result is a major unemployment in the countries where prices are high compared to other economies.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Since the private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and thereby responsibility towards the unemployment it brings, the social charges necessarily increase.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to offset the economic and social damage to the whole of society in this race for profit.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The unscrupulous practices of private capital are in different economies a situation in which the governments of the various countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract the foreign capital.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of the private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This occurs primarily in the amendments of existing laws.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The goal is to compel economically its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of a long-term unemployment and by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Germany, there are for years of public distribution points for food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
There are already millions of the number of these people.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a supplement to the bare minimum.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Such a scandal for example has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The economy measures of virtually all of southern EU Member States, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), to eke out with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital to invest in their country.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
We must ask the question: where will the capital?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty from one country to another; this capital may not come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The liberal theory and the media to say, get bored with it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic disaster.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Then ask whether private capital does not influence and, even, is not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and, at the same time, the entire state.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful and present in all states.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In Germany, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The entire power does not come from the people, as the state constitutions of Western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It is clear that democracies-oriented liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book " the crisis in the Roman empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey ": " the state has long been deteriorating and functions were attributed by violence.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The blows of bribes, favors illegally obtained and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The kickbacks and corruption throve without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold "...... " honest people are not sought functions, the result was once the state remained 8 months without consuls '... ' It really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he had to choose an energetic man "... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of the personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
As a result, today as in the past, a decadence unprecedented elites, without any effort to carry out reforms.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
So we must look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalising unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
In the current state of affairs, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal type democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by the old and recent history.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and in internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This trend is systemic.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The solution consists of sociopolitical referred reforms, which will strengthen the capital investment in the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

It is a part of a political thriller designed realistic but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful coup, treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The atmospheres occur: Tehran sequences of documentary style (subtitled sequences are presented the iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, through these pictures, these situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no major differences)
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And then the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
</seg>
</p>

<seg id="23">
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Actor ridiculed, he became a director respected and his acting ceased to raise ironic remarks.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Argo is his third feature after dark "policeman Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "Trainspotting" (2010).
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It is also the first film, Affleck who does not take place in his hometown, Boston.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put his first films above Hollywood standards.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Affleck also demonstrated this sense of the Argo atmosphere in which the role of Tehran "is required" by Canada.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the collapse of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, writing a page of history.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Affleck and his colleagues get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the false film crew in the bazaar in Tehran).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Too many actions in too many places
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
The director had to settle for a topic with few exciting scenes, the film sense of the word.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
He fared well, it adds some elements to the reality and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the airstrip are quite far-fetched.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many events in too many different locations.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and it is not far from the only in this case.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he is a moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It takes the viewer, but with difficulty.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case.

Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts each year a public inquiry into banking fees the most absurd, has now decided to launch the regulation or ideas from "the EU workshop" the most absurd.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
"The fact that the EU is considering, lately, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies was at the root of our decision," said the newspaper Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Until now, however, women were an advantage in terms of insurance tariffs on life because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
People can report until the end of the year another incredible idea of the "workshop of the EU."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Among the controversial EU regulations, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, which has negative consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of hens, which has resulted in an increase in the price of eggs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Critics have also been issued in the past against the ban on use of the phrase "butter spreads" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Bananas quality must have a size 14 centimetres.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes applications for its banks by threatening to use its veto).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that in the EU, bananas must not be less than 14 cm or submit an "abnormal curvature."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The European Commission has defended by arguing that it was only harmonize national standards nonhomogeneous complicating the trade.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some states, arguing that the existing directives wasteful of foodstuffs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulation last year that must appear on the inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The EU has made reference to a US investigation that the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 to blow in trumpets.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Also, there are bizarre ideas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The next rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In collaboration with the "let Making" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the regulation of the European Union regarding the volume of reserves of food products in the territory of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The Czech Republic overcame then, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked, a heavy fine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The organizers of this investigation found merit in the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of a grant to ask the grants.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
These ideas are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
" The fact of not having sea we underdevelops.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
We are going to ask the European Union a refund. " And spoke in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
</seg>
<seg id="27">
He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state got full stocks that he had to then export.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Subsidies for grants have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should actually be used to write applications for grants from Brussels.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
The EU says: "the bizarre regulations are rare."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts by EU regulatory and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union, as well as in the field of its general development, rather deserve praise.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other EU countries, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fight that it does not always winner) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
If at the end of six-year battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for which the appellation "Tuzemský rum" back home in the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Only the alcohol-based products, sugar cane, and not based on sugar beet, can bear the name of rum.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
In the official list of registered products from the EU, today in the company of cheese known worldwide as the Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice carp and Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and hops of Žatec ("chmel Žatecký").

People want me to save the Republic, but I am only an amateur, declares Okamura Senator
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Senator, how was the idea to stand in presidential elections?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
This is not to be a senator or president who account for me.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If everything worked without problems in our country, I am not a candidate anywhere.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But I no longer bear to see how the country is looted over the past 20 years, that thieves are not behind bars and taxes and the retirement age increase.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I had no ambition to become a politician.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But when I see something, then I am trying to find a solution for that change.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that presidential and senatorial elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
You entered the Senate but you put quickly en route to the Castle (, seat of the presidency).
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Do you not turn and back to those who elected you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
I have always said that I am indulging in the battle for the Castle depending on the results of the senatorial elections
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Subsequently, I have said that if I was elected senator, I would come to the presidential elections.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
My goal is not the function, it is merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broader mandate.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The problem is not only as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is compounded by the press the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It was, for example, said in my speech I misreporting journalists or that I was the counsellor Jiří Paroubek.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Turning to your visions.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
You started the fight for the Castle with hobbyhorse themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond 20 million [CZK].
</seg>
<seg id="20">
To this end, you have to change the law.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
How do you solve this problem?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tourist guide is a profession, I have been successful.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The problem is politics: when someone is left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and delaying citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As independent, a member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
I have the advantage of being able to, without supporters categorization and dogma, each party take what is best for our country and implement it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
You consider as a man of right or left?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people would rather put on the left.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For me, whether it is a bit to the left or right, it is not really important.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
What counts for me, it is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist party or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Do you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But what you said would not prove?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
You try to reconcile.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
But without the support of parliament, you are only slogans.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
You survivrez not long in politics with this.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Do you think that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
I have no other option.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
I must convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and try to rally them to my camp to impose it.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
When there is a strong personality that will identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Take, for example, the election of the president directly, it has been achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
I admit, bluntly, be a fan, and not a genius or an intellectual.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I just got involved in politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
I try to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I will stop in six years and I will return to the private sector.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
It is a bit like if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I am not a savior.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I know that one person may not make a difference, that is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Radim Jančura I met, but he refused because of the amount of work.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud in oil.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
I came because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what were, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Do you intend to build your own party?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
You don't have money?
</seg>
<seg id="65">
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
I think about 60 million the value of my personal property.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
In Prague I land worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth approximately 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always liked James Bond, travelling by car, was with women and fought against evil and abuse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
You drive Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
</seg>
<seg id="71">
It is not very convincing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
I should debt?
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate great interest.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
But I could not live, for instance, to pay the English school my son costing 30 thousand per month.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
If my only aim was to earn money, I will present to any election.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
You will therefore continue your commercial activities in order to live?
</seg>
<seg id="81">
Did you said that you would put your activities muted?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
But this is not linked to the amount of the compensation.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
For example, my assistant will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
People would like I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
But although I live for something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">
What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.

If I were president, I would end my commercial activities.

"I think that this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a bandwidth on the side of the street.

Stefan Spermon, a scientist in a large neighbouring company, says: "yes, it is actually nice, this building."

But I wonder why we still need a library.

Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.

Today, no one will voluntarily in one of these elderly libraries, no?

Spijkenisse, a dormitory, which is not attractive to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a very special record.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The commune of 80000 souls has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In order to restore some neurons in the brain, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven shadow bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of small beautiful miniature reinforced concrete painted.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
That is how the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to retake control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Winy Maas, of the architectural firm of Rotterdam MVRDV, master diagrams in bold sticks and creator of witty buildings and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And while the committee is still watching, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila its books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and ended his speech supported activists arguments by one: "dear common!"
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has sprung up.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The building is part of a revitalization project that also has an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."

In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.

That is how this small dull village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades suggest that they support a dairy, is enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first cultural public building in its history.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The long road to reading
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
First impression: Eldorado book under glass cheese.

<seg id="23">
Of course, an elevator takes you through the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture are open to you when you stand on the soil of building to the discovery of its topography.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and airy, soil in Dutch bricks and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public places.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Is already the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball.

<seg id="27">
And everywhere books, books and even books.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
"Normally, the stacks are located along the facade and the environment is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and open spaces reading from inside to outside.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The mountain of books has been skillfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the Central Building.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, balustrades and stair railings.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Even the architects and engineers building hardened do not want unknown materials.

"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.

Szabo: "the Germans must play a greater role."
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But she then chose to abstain.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Stephen Szabo: Germany do not agree with what the Israelis in Gaza.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relations with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
In the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Germany finds it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The answer is yes.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to introduce a German foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In addition, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Germans therefore faces a number of fronts.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I think they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the road to a foreign policy "more normal".
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
That then means the term "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It shows the willingness to adopt independent positions from those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to the national records.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
These economic interests have influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle East and abstain from the vote of the United Nations?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
That is why Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
This is undoubtedly a crucial element.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
However, I would not see it too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But that is in any case, a key element in the German strategic considerations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Germany night to its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
That is why I think the divide is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Perhaps that Germany will be respected.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Indeed, Germany has also demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
In Europe, opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shown great understanding for the European position.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not to be excited about the policy of Netanyahu.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Germany finds it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the major European partners?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
I think it does not make things any easier for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, it is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
So they cannot register within a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
That is what they are currently in the question of the euro.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
In my opinion, Germany will play a role in the future of locomotive and pushes Europe to adopt a European position.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
It is not easy for Germany, in particular because of relations with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
This issue has always been delicate.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Germany is playing a role of weight on the international stage, Germany wants to only play a key role?
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Or does it always difficult to assume leadership roles?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Germany is still not accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
It does not make things any easier for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
From this standpoint, Germany is in a far more delicate position that the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It must cope with neighbours and very diverse opinions, and it is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Today, the United States ' influence on the European policy does not diminish, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this void, then who is?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated is life!

" Protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Armani Polo... what is it really?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Behind this lies a trademark in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The mark and enjoys protection as the company that bears the name cannot complain.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And even if it could, it is not clear that it would succeed.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing specialised in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Each week, a new record arrives on my desk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Imitators require only a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Pattloch opens a cabinet in which the registrations with the trademark office in Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In large cities, malls on several floors which virtually sell counterfeits.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its principals load to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Chinese speak of "Mingpai bang," parent brand.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The term is derived from "Dakuan bang."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It is with this term that are designated women who marry to wealthy men.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach itself.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"It is bad for business, we must fight against this trend," requires Pattloch.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The financial losses and legal costs totalling millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the costly flagship products.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to data from the company market analysis CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third global market for luxury goods and expanding the faster.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
However, it is not easy to write off the questionable registrations from the register trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Pattloch reported trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticised had become a "market reality."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiaire, as it would have interfered with its brand in China.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Famous cases are also graphic elements.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of construction machine Sany, the same company that came from the pumps Putzmeister concrete.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Xinhua, the Volvo logger, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW and the dispute was settled and Xinhua had to amend it.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarism of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
However, the office would be spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a restored normality."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Nearly 57000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% from the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain outstanding at the office.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Act is expensive
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The past year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This should also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
A legal battle cost much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
"It is our fault, because the family names may not be protected in Germany," said Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the objection of Munichites.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Freudenberg has certainly been successful with two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Vigilance is
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praising the professionalism of the judges.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"That is what we can see what this means for us," says Wentzler.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
This would be the case if imitators of this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected brands.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company of footwear and leather.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but she could still prevent the filing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is needed."
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Pattloch and advises German companies to demonstrate a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead "record in China everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler said.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for using his own name, as Wentzler explains.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Alternatively, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.

What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white losses, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the emergence of buttons and warts.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.

<seg id="56">
How to protect themselves?
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or bodily close contacts.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Experts recommend to anyone often changing sexual partners spend regular reviews.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Most quickly detected IST can be cured and the late legacy can be avoided.

"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects sexuality."
</seg>
<seg id="72">
It is somewhat curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
</seg>

The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his lifestyle excessive.

These mores sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.

In order to promote the somewhat cultural exchange, Imbongi choristers overall travel every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know of apartheid.

The bus filled with white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only a good mood and joy, but sometimes a tear to some formidable border guards.
</seg>

<seg id="81">
The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.

Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.

The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published on Thursday in the journal "science".
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the world permanently immersed in the shadows.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres of up to 20 metres.

Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would hit Mercury.

<p>
<seg id="51">
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo does the screens a year later to observe the stars.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see further into the universe.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale Observatory at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.

The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The diameter reached about 11 metres.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the level of vertical angle.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
Its uniqueness lies in its great capacity for collection of light.

But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, about which we do not know much, except that they are fluent in Persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.

<seg id="15">
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.

It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.

The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.

"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.

However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, think it is a question of food.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
However, it does not seem plausible, a nutritional point of view, that the calorie meals of Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.

They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.

Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its business "in order to save the revolution."
</seg>
</p>

However, the Egyptians and the world does not really know what this engineer wants to save 61 years, earned a doctorate at the American University of Southern California.

The judiciary will be reversed?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly muslim 100 people during a tour de force night fifteen hours are indeed worrying to some extent.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the case is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
But that really means the word "principles"?
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and flexibility consequent legal to enforce a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
In any case is that an article suggests newly introduced stipulating that, in respect of all matters pertaining to sharia, Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance rayon throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Many parts of the draft constitution are open to interpretation
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of the military court.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to repress opponents.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11000 civilians were detained by the military.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The state must also can be read in the project, to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote morality and values."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could control the content of art and literature.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Clearly, it is simply censorship.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In addition, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Instead, another article prohibits to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
However, the article does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden "to offend people."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi put to vote and who, in his own words, "very soon" subject to a referendum among Egyptians.

The opposition is protesting for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "thrown into the dustbin of history."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to foment a "coup against democracy."

"If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and the reverse," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.

"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.

"The Koran is our constitution"
</seg>

<p>

For its part, the Muslim brotherhood, well-organized, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised before the University of Cairo.

Headscarved women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people are asking for the application of the law of God."

"Cleans our country!", they asked Morsi, saying that "the Koran was [their] Constitution."
</seg>

A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.

Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.

</p>
<p>

The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear.

He did not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible.

<seg id="56">
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.

The rakfisk Norway: is this the most fragrant fish in the world?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The five million people who live in Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to appetite premises for an extremely odorous fish?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Take advanced cheeses.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Put them in the middle of a pile of football wet clothes and dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Wait a week.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is snowing, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a period - according to the smell that you want him exhaling - which can go up to a year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
When darkness settled and that it is cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"You eat raw, and then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, local full-time firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and seem to be a large amount of drink.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk," adds Havard.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The drink kills the smell.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I try a few pieces.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If you can avoid the move under your nose, it is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in barrels of water airtight, then salted in the autumn.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Then, during the winter, once fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the sense undermined by alcohol - eaten.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high salaries and a comprehensive system of health.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country it was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, although fragrant, past Norway.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you € 10 each.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Norway does not often talk about it in the international news, which is not to displease him.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
When they talk about the killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such an act of barbarism.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"But the oil is not the sole reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, blonde hair and blue eyes transfixing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plateau rakfisk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We are - how do you say - conservative people.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We are discreet, we do not like us.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
When other countries threw money down the drain, over the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse tightly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she says in a carefree laugh.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I am standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I have had my dose of rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery is excellent.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The hotel where I stayed is one of many places where there is rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the strongest scent of them.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bowties, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
We have gone in the Eurovision Song Contest.

<p>
<seg id="45">

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
"This is our views, Havard."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
We hear laughter and applause.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish.

I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.

<p>
<seg id="2">
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of mistreatment of Bradley Manning would have been a victim during the detention.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The trial focuses on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that sequestration of Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US army - has missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
The cross-examination - during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the Manning case is classified on the grounds that sequestration was made in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment - took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
This analyst of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
At the hearing Friday, Fein has examined with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Officers have asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
When Fein spoke forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that gave him his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had been in the prison was generally "very professional."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The forms do not refer to any complaint of mistreatment, although officers have directly asked about his prison treatment, Fein said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about some of the problems and the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said they would fix them, but they have not recorded the issues raised.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
"They have written" no problem "(after addressing concerns), and for all that, this did not mean that I had not caused any problems," said Manning.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The military said they had assigned this restrictive status - a level below the close surveillance for risk of suicide - for its protection and safety of others.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be cut this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
He said that he had contemplated suicide when he was in Kuwait and have vanished once because of the heat.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He added that the fact of not having been informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," said Manning, on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Manning also added that the only objects there was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and glasses.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay extended during the day was contrary to the regulations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they woken up in order to be able to see his face.

The Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Also Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning regarding an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday - after having been forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover themselves with coverage during the appeal.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
During the judge's questions, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to drop its coverage that could hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered the release.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his or her flip-flops to be injured, but that he had not done so.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial trial should be held early next year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
The defence said that Manning intends to plead guilty of less serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the detention conditions of all detainees in Quantico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
If all charges are retained, he could face life imprisonment.

My Mexican-American identity crisis
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans difficult periods, " he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Navarrette said that the Mexico-US find themselves caught between two worlds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby before the customs and immigration, I felt lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "extranjeros" ("aliens").
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing where to file my lead.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is an ethnic qualifier, in the same way that my friends in Boston use when they say they are Irish ", or my friends in New York when they say ' Italian."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Then I became "Mexico-American."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
But here, it was Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And, on the land that was the birthplace of my grandfather, there is no need for special qualifier or hyphens.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I was simply an American.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I speak Spanish well enough to manage a maintenance in either language.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I do not have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal man, and I can't lose my American accent.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Then I took my American passport and I headed the queue "foreigners".
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risking the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
And Pena Nieto is committed to pursuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede in writing half their territory at gunpoint.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Therefore, once a formal U.S. formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elites - complaints about how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And children of Montezuma seek the brawl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexico Americans who live in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
You want to address the topic of bitterness?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
There are many.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
And more often than not, this person was a typical profile - a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Not Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
And even if we are experiencing the American dream, that we have gone in good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not the Mexicans.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We are in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn't like.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The feeling is mutual.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We remind them a humiliating defeat and sea, as if we were individuals and not sufficiently Mexican strain.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And we would find ourselves not stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans more firmly assert their identity and Mexico Americans are upset.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Although American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of both countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
Moreover, many Mexico Americans that I know do not have the impression of being part of a country or the other.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
And now, for a little more complicated relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to move closer to the Diaspora.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
They want the Mexico Americans work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Yes, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
This will not happen.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
There is too much bitterness.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And, if we consider the wage inequality, corruption and violence linked to the drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
This is normal.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans they always want how family members were treated there is not so long ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
Hmmm.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.

Old quarrels, new Middle East
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that this is vain hope.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
While still the same futile arguments about who began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Arab spring shattered, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Maybe their fight will increase even more.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
A war that is no loser and no winner
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of the force, on both sides.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza suffered a beating.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the globe, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
In addition, the leaders of Hamas could say that the time is their ally.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas is rich and powerful friends.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Turkey, a regional power booming, formerly the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Hamas members exulted and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, through Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend may reverse Bashar Assad, and up to Jordan, where the Hamas allies threaten the king.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Meanwhile, the hardliners of Israel draw the opposite conclusions.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The interceptor missile system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly at night - for some time.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
But above all, Israel has prospered, including Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegality in terms of international law.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, the beautiful game.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Why spoil the pesky Palestinian by giving them a state?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
If they ran the West Bank, would they not rockets, like their compatriots did in Gaza?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
It is better to keep them behind this wall and strike as soon as they leave the head.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but it may be that the Arab spring game changer.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The defence budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours combined.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire which bodes well - and could mark the beginning of something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
The Israelis should also think about the future.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
With the rest of the Arab world that is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for external people to defend this case.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Egypt, which must now tackle to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the next proposal for a state to the UN.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Mr Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
During his first term, it has not presented his own peace plan.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Back at the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
It is a very narrow vision.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The laws for cigarette packages neutral came into force in Australia
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Outside the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is the most strict regime in the world of tobacco packaging.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The Australian federal government has said that the aim was to dissuade young people from smoking by removing any glamour representation.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they never start.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
" Even when they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image, " said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children tied the crown of a logo to a princess. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Although Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would reopen the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"The negative consequences of this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the application of cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has sharply increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Ha said that Zico has sold 6000 wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
For us, business is good.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the people targeted by the plan.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you no longer have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the ideal place par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
We must ask whether it is a simple citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulations in force, rather than on marketing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have reported to the WHO, that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Canada was the first country to make the mandatory warning pictures on the packaging in 2001.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Tougher laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The photos do not disturb.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I do not know.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"You take a cigarette and the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package which includes a photo of tumour of the mouth.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
To be frank, the only reason that will make me stop, that is my little girl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
James Yu, manager of the "King of the tobacconist Pack" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made difficult storage of packages on the shelves.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"The government had to ban it once and for all and we would have said OK, it is good, and is the key in the door," he added, by lifting the arms to the sky.

In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
I am not going to lie.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the shops of duty-free).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praising the boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This forces the brain to borrow interesting paths, even to feed creativity.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Then we should welcome boredom with open arms?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Yes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And no.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But I will return.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Boredom goes back very far," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Then there is the definition of boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, " said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
</seg>
</p>

After numerous publications and submitted the idea in a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is "willing to do something, but without coming to embark on a satisfactory activity."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would like.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
What is at the heart of boredom, " he said, is " the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a sullen mood and feel that time passes slowly. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Boredom can strongly resemble a depression.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem is.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Sometimes we think we bored while it is a problem of concentration.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
As part of their study, "the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV show that had no connection, others have just heard the TV show, and the third group has not heard the soundtrack.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level said they were more annoyed that the other two groups - they have struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or forgettable, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, " said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
On the other hand, when you make a boring task, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you do not get bored."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In fact, he says, now we know that when wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, is actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidgeting learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
We all bored one day - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly boring film.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
The scale includes statements such as "among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do everything."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to miss more often than girls, " said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimuli.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
But in general, teenagers are quickly blase.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported bored.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period where boredom reached its highest level," particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
If I ask my question: boredom is good for you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, " said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the problem for more than two decades.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
"Boredom is the way that the brain was found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, this will make you happy.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But if you look at the TV, this will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it will miss more, but it will not have learned to handle alone, nor to autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And "this autorèglement moves from one situation to another," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
I do not think we should glorify boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Just as I do not think that we should criticise it.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Feel comfortable outside the constant flurry activities and technology is the goal towards which we should strive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
"We need to annoy more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
According to him, what people are looking for, it is a way to disconnect and appreciate the downtime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."

In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, is indicted for something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Mr Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were aboard a car at Lamar, in the middle of fields near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment suitable for consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a court date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"We are treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But is it?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalise the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place of the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were closed.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The police have ceased to indict adults aged 21 or older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts in Colorado have called for speeding up the affairs of existing marijuana and continue to charge those who possess.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of western currently vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the state in their neighbourhoods.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"Things are changing so rapidly that I don't know what will happen in the future," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Regulators in the state of Washington are also a lot of questions.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They are looking for guidance on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in the regulation on marijuana, firstly on the therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, cannot do more than suggest what works.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"There is no real precedent on which we could build," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum a year, during which the permit system there will always be, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees appropriate access to marijuana approved and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or a nursery.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a registered trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "city attorney" (procuracy) would no longer pursue people aged 21 or older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to charge people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In Weld County in northern Colorado, the district attorney " (Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on users to detoxify.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are other convictions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
"Our office has the obligation to prosecute these people who have committed a crime, which at the time, was a recognized offence," Mr. Buck said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favour of the limited use of marijuana.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The representative of the public prosecutor of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all cases of detention of marijuana.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"I didn't feel like I was wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
While 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and appropriate government to personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
"It is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public prosecutor, "said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the reform of laws on marijuana).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
"They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, also, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As the first states to treat the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a jurisprudence for the legalisation of drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
While advocates and representatives of the state provide a new frontier of legalised sales, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will break.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has largely enabled shops selling marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
If it is true that the police will probably not enfoncer doors to seize small bags of drugs, it is likely that she is opposed to the licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, " said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Many cities in Colorado were not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Even before the votes, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a year's delay.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months and should impose the ban next week.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a licence is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Our community has voted against the amendment.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
</seg>

Petronella Wyatt: I have been bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
</seg>
<seg id="2">
It is not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
My father and my eldest brother studied in what was for me a prominent place, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
However, two weeks after I installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
My father collapsed and began to cry.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
My friends were puzzled.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The newspaper The Evening Standard argued that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The author A.N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The truth was less funny.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I fled.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and been the subject of constant bullying.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Not because of my name rather extreme, nor because I had a private school.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I have been persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a advised influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Why mention this today, you might say.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students from the centre-right suffers the same type of persecution.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that the last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The conservative members of the students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They want there to be a representative in the committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("the Wonderland: young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to politics among students, and depicting the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It found the student including Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), " which uses a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and travels with a cane chrome.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
In other universities, Conservatives students say they are treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the increase in tuition fees. "
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the " Nottingham University Conservative Association, " said in a Sunday newspaper that " there is a bias left growing in universities.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history in Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, aged 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre-right.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the welfare of members," she said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
I am coming in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a crippling shyness.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Hatred of the Conservative party was highly virulent.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The previous year, the university had voted the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding of higher education.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In the first days of the week host, when the new students met with others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what would happen afterwards.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm to the Tory students, but they were fun.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood classrooms.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The first sarcasm that I was the victim was a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I wasn't prepared.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
"Wyatt Miss," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
</seg>
<seg id="37">
I lost my footing.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Pitt, a small man in pustular face, won easily.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
"Is it that the Thatchéristes refuse to learn English or are they just stupid?" He asked.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Other students laughed.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The tears I burned the eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"I suggest you take courses in French during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy you make friends," he launched a truculent tone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
I returned to my room, inconsolably.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
At the dinner that evening, I am sitting alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
It was a student in second grade English, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
I am afraid that this is the case.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Most of the young Tory claim to be the Labour (Labour).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide me.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that had Mrs Thatcher said.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
This ploy failed.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
A student in first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig."
</seg>
<seg id="55">
You are contaminated.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Other students echoed the refrain.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
I was perverted, dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
"How the Tories do they love?" Asked one of them.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
They hit each other, isn't it? "

</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I would only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
I would have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Should I have become Labour and disown my opinions?

He was in disbelief.

"Valentino prefers elegance to the reputation"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
In the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," opened this week in London, ABC Naty questioned Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The designer acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture," a prestigious retrospective, which brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "his pigments" Garavani, who is universally but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Valentino has always been fascinated by the world closed and part of the nobility.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 next March, is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Valentino exposes its personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the international jet set.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
There is nothing wrong with love royalty.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"At least they do not overwhelm their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as some pop stars," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
" We all adore be invited in his Gstaad chalet, " said the ex-wife of " Heini Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent as larger Agnelli or Eugénie hopes.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Even so, it is a star.

<p>
<seg id="18">
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
They saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"With him, every guest feel important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which has begun to work with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"It will never, because his creations are works of art," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Parade of noble lineage
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
He loves the people and with the biggest titles and they love it too.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a glamorous podium 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must stepped onto the podium for a "public" dream bearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "la Notte," or jacket in wool and fur that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Among the public of mannequins are names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
I remember perfectly well.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
It was a pair of trousers, shirts, "gillette" vest and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"It is a gift that he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"I prefer to all other for her femininity, his love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
I love the colours he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The proportions are perfect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola Arenberg cannot also forget the first time she has been a model Valentino.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreams of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his gowns...
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I bought my first Valentino model for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
It was an evening dress in red, with a skirt flying, a draped bodice and a neckline to fall.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d 'Arenberg.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," said the Italian aristocrat who divides his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Princess d 'Arenberg retains the evening dresses designer with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories it conveys."

</p>

<p>
<seg id="46">
The final great exposure of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer and calls its seamstresses) to achieve this ivory silk dress with coloured beads, lace twelve different kinds and a four and a half metres.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients of high society."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Obsessed for years by the "knowledge" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani has more honoured than any spouse of its clients.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
"Its refinement, its calm, careful and perfect aspect I have always jumped in the eyes," acknowledges Arenberg.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.

The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health through 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who are literally in hell.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
That is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living by wearing the sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Having collected large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilograms, it installs in two baskets of bamboo that burden on his shoulders through the steep trails.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
There are only 250 metres until the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 metres, but the exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, crawling along, keeping the balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They know that a misstep could cost their life, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur extract.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Once at the top, he fought their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the three kilometres to balance a mining company has installed a little below 1.850 metres.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, arguably, its employees, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It then sells to 10000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to launder sugar.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
"As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," says Anto, which usually performs three trips per day.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Each is 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort is triple what it would do in the fields.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the porter who worked previously as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There, his salary was $75000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia is also indisputable that sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java to convert to Islam."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
At 27 years, he has spent three of his life to defy the danger on the ljen Kawah, but sulphur has already begun to pay the bill although he covers the face with a mask and gloves.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas emitted by the volcano.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"I am going to work two years ago, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" promises in an English more than acceptable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Battered by life, friendly and intelligent young could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead, it is the work of a donkey.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He shares a hovel of unhealthy wood with other carriers, wakes up each day at two o 'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to jaillir at night, when his characteristic yellow colour becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Defying the dark, Anto descends into the crater in with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Despite its profits, the mining company has not mécanisé extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who are self-employed and are paid by weight.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In addition, they do not affect a under 30000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of the natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
"This work is done for the animals, not humans," Madrusin protest, a portly bearer of 42 years working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilograms, it ensures that it will not stop working "as long as he can," because it needs money to raise her 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my entire life.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap minors in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer serious illnesses... plus, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53-year-old can only load 50 kilos.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three trucks at the warehouse Tamansari, 18 kilometres away by a sheep trail overrun by weeds.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," says Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The eldest of his five children, age 30, also works as a bearer of sulphur.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Time is running out, but the misery passed down from generation to generation and one of the most difficult trades in the world: what are the human mules of ljen Kawah volcano.

It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for pellets mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The words come from a rap group that uses local references as "will put an open in the drawer" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem of fun way through this advertising.

Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to "fulfill their national duty."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
It is intended solely to the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is the main problem in this country.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that it was a theme that we have to address.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
We knew that the government had tried several things like launch pheromone perfume or organize evenings of speed-dating.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Many of these ideas were creative, but they may not have worked.

We thought: what could be more creative to solve this problem to a rap song?

Children 1.2
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The Singapore government does not take more seriously.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It spends 1.300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers provides up to 15000 dollars per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
But it had little effect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Singapore is a wealthy city-state and high-tech South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
So why Singaporeans do not more children?
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Tan Wei Ming, Director of policy of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the constitution of a family," she explains.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Meanwhile, an immigration policy to radically increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In Singapore, there are Web sites that abounds xenophobia barely disguised against the new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of wages down and not to integrate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year its worst election results since independence.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Irreversible consequences
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
The government is trying to avoid the construction of small houses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
The authorities of the urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale has been a great success.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoebox" sell much faster than the largest housing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
They are more popular in the sense that these homes are built much more quickly than larger.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
However, he conceded that the new standards give clearer instructions to proponents, who was previously a spanner in the works if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Too much stress
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Singapore is a city-state.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people defer," says a young framework.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Other people can have children.

"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young 20s.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to the property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.

Key issues
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Porras noted that Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in education from Yale University and author of the book "natives and digital immigrants," uses these words to explain the phenomenon.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"We are digital immigrants who must teach them, while we ourselves are learning," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
He added that the issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should be or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use issues are sobering.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"Tell them not to do so is pointless," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you would not be telling to a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Or, you like to publish a photo of you as a friend you published?
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Do you know what others publish on you?
</seg>
<seg id="52">
When you identified photos of celebrations, asking others permission to identify them?
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And also, everyone does need to know what you are doing at any moment?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
It is the same rules.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Monitoring
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and advisor education, says that it is essential that parents dutifully read the conditions of use of social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
In each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"For example, age and what he is permitted to share or publish," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to strangers.

The summit of Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration is made public
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today ended in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by 7 agents present.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Efe has tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Ordinary Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency have reported initially that it would be disclosed after the close of the summit, and said that it would be published a moment on the website of the Peruvian government.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Journalists ' access to information about the summit was constantly limited.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, restricts audio" was circulated in the press room.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The little information circulating among journalists were given by the press of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
The single document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which concluded the summit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been urged by the press, he had not issued the statement also called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
On the official site of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published in March.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum information.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The summit has also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague settled a different border between the two countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at the regional appointments and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear arguments from both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
"We will respect and implement the verdict which will solve disputes that we have today in this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera by giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The confirmation of two presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after that Colombia has this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to comply with the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime boundary with Nicaragua it considered seriously wrong.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 following the removal of ex-President Fernando Lugo, was not involved in the appointment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The host, President Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would provide "important steps to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
He informed that action would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to evaluate joint and effectively the risks of natural disasters. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
With Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our people," President Humala concluded.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and border... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a speech.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and were on the horizontal axis of its territory, from the coast in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give more details.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
" We hope that the electoral process in this country will be readmitted to the Union of South American Nations, of which he is currently excluded.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme at the summit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the rendez-vous Regional, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"We will review all of these routes, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we are going to sort out the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they planned to attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc will meet to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country to be suspended.

"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "were killing each other during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American countries, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has shown in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon and take into account the signatories of the San Jose pact on human rights.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Those who have bombarded us ears will never compromise nothing, conversely, we, the South American, have all signed.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision because he did not even betrayed its principles, but he instead met its "deep democratic values and human rights."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He concluded that at the time, "there was a suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
In addition, he criticised the Swedish justice who demanded that he submit on its territory for questioning on an alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish law allows the videoconference, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked into a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"It affects the health of anyone," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Correa noted that the solution for asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stressed that he had had discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there were ongoing discussions.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched a series of procedures from various European bodies," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
And he believes that "if Britain gave the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And if Sweden, as allowed by the law, and as it has done in other cases, Mr Assange quizzed the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or asked via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that what he did not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that undermine freedom of expression."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
In this light, it welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "not the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, instead of putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempts coup disguised" because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
What is more, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We need to solve the overall to overtake them and move forward.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said he is "beneficial that Latin America seize the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept such a firm judgment."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Correa assured that, if he lost the primary February 2013, it would be withdrawing from public life.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
On a personal level, the power I was never interested, but also unfair situations than those of Ecuador, the socio-economic poverty can only be solved through the political power.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
If I won, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will retire then political life.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
If we lose, I will do well.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"It is my decision," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"This does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chávez," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.

AIDS-related deaths are today due to a late detection.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the outcome of the test: positive.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It is as if the sky was falling on the head," he said referring to the time of the announcement that the doctor had tried to make "less painful" in vain.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The young man was hidden to his family.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He decided to take charge of his illness and began to learn about him and his determination was such that he has just celebrated his 43 birthday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Then, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided him "because he was speechless."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the unit's HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes to reference that this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The infectiologue and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of the immune system that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis in 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years," said the scientist interviewed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
To put this progress in its context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexican today is 76 years on average.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
If it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS rose from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011, according to the annual report from UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 dead until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
So why is he still death?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
That is how I see it, that is what happened in our hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never failed to drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or when they learn in the advanced stages of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is deliver earlier diagnoses, and for that, we must offer testing, to all those who request it."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Experts and members of the State Council AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has done his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour which is one of the common complications.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Some think they are going to die and don't want to know.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"If I am going to die, it is better that I broke out three times a week," they say, it is not my case.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I am exercising, I take my medication.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
To date, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"I am working, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but colead, I pay attention to me and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO ARE GROWING to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
They make the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.

His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.

Condoms on the counter
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
And the greatest lies in prevention.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In all sites dedicated to this, "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now we have packages, it is all very well, but the result is that, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The question: "what do you do?" Asked sarcastically and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold counters, but they are found in distributors of public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
It is not to encourage promiscuity.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
It is not to pay their girls and the motel, as had answered the Governor Emilio González when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"It is not like this that sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms for those already sexually active," he said.

From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
First, while the judge hearing the case noted that creditors must register under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The first point would denounce the international cooperation procedure in business insolvencies with a transnational profile.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
In fact, the law Model United Nations Law Consistencies Commercial International had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Secondly, the ruling establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Here there is a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of Commerciales bankruptcies had guarantees the debts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
In addition, what is certain is that, as it remained the votes of subsidiaries, creditors of all the ways of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
A particular omitted by the court of appeal.

<p>

On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation that he met since 2008 without stopping the severe economic crisis that faced the United States, passing the costs in the country.

The use of insurance will non-prosperity and requires the retrial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (friend of the Court ") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, noting that this was the conventions signed by the two countries to the same level as paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In addition, he noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say the rules set for the case of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.

"Hetin" Héctor Reyes "basketball is my life"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The globe-trotter basketball " Hetin Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled around the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of "Héctor" Hetin Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage do condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as chairman of the federation of basketball.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"I have brought several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, general director of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Basketball is my whole life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Reyes did not exaggerate when he made this assertion.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary, testify.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Bayamón in heart
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Of all his memories, he loves the most are those that remind her of her passage as a player in the team Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager and manager of the team.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
" This has been my best years, I have benefited the most because I have had the opportunity to participate in eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, either as manager, co-manager or a leader.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the OBS team.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
From there, " Cuco " Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the helm of the team, " said Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: " I have a hefty player for you, it measures two metres.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You want it? "
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Bartow me then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalised and who was one of the best shooters.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
He welcomed the championship of Gausse Vaqueros with, but only at a distance as in 1988 it was already the czar of the federation.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Then there was the World 1990, where we came fourth and where we should have won the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game, Reyes said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The team of the World 1990 is the best national team that you view?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
It is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But my favourite is the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and that we have put a beating in the United States team, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and " Piculín " (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) " Toñito Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and " Quijote " Mario Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
With players like " Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess in the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all predictions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Undoubtedly, it is Piculín Ortiz.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Puerto Rico to nobody has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he played.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
That was the best Puerto Rican leader?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
It is very difficult to say.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
In young people, I love the work of Leo Arill.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the OBS had up to 17 teams in a season.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
You are there to do?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
There are things that I wanted to put in place, such as the regionalisation of minor categories.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
For example, that boys of Ponce play only in their area and only teams from other corners of the island during the play-offs.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Today, young people are travelling and playing too much while it is not necessarily needed.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory qualifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
It makes me happy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
What are you doing today?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend games of basketball.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And of course, I would like to take the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Actor Larry Hagman
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, is internationally known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he embodied an unscrupulous businessman, formidable and manipulative.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Larry Hagman, whose role of oil tycoon unscrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He had 81 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement by the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., a production of "Dallas."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas in the holiday of Thanksgiving.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and then stood with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it will greatly miss.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"It was a person of exception and he lived life to," Gray said in a statement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had acknowledged many drunk for many years.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he had undergone a transplant.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman was announced on television in the role of an ordinary type in "Jinny series of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive engineering, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought home.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
He also played in two comedies that have remained shortly, "the Good Life (§N§B§C§,§ §1§9§7§1§-§7§2§)" and "here We Go Again" (§A§B§C§,§ §1§9§7§3§).
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Among his film roles include roles well received by critics in the "group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed its greatest success.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and their relatives was issued in April 1978 to May 1991.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The slogan "who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in bets.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record hearing at this time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers averaged in front of their screen and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had collected 50 million viewers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
J.R. had put pregnant and had then threatened to accuse the prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for the attack.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but the charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to confine his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
"I know what it would take as epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
We should write: "here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Here is the only game he had lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Victoria Principal, hosted the original series, recalled on Friday of Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen in life."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the chance to know and love.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain.

A course dealing with the "end of the world" has just begun

This semester, when the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he launched an irresistible hook: the end of the "countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, referred to by many as proof of the impending end of the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
But Professor Charmé had no idea what to expect over the following months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the "Armageddon debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time believed that would trigger the apocalypse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic half that I have never known," said Professor Charmé this week to its students from Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey.

If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it was a very good period.
