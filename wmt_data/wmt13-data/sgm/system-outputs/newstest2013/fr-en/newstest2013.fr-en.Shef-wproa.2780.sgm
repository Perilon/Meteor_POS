<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Centre Brennan as a myth, saying that the electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, the lawyers Republicans have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of the United States federal elections.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the registration process or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010, which is perhaps add 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 Member States.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that the voters have an identity card with photo and proof of US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws also help reduce the voting times in anticipation, invalidates the right to register as voter the polling day and withdraw the citizens with a legal issue their right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, no state required of American voters to present an identity card with picture.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities is empressèrent to extend this practice in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years, they parrainaient projects of law in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike the Quebec, the US citizens have no identity card as the universal health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity cards with photo issued by a government agency of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a coin of identity.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, it is often more than 100 dollars for the identity card required.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect the young, minorities, and those on low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35 000 dollars; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters of 18 to 29 years do not have the required with photo ID card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Much more.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students, the voters considered voting more to the candidates Democrats, are not allowed in several Member States to use their identity card with photo from their institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, these same States allow the Members of the fishing clubs or hunting that vote more of the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen Member States have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it appears that two Hispanic voters on three promote the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters the polling day in eight Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">They have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to the voters to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, when the general election of 2004, the registration of voters have contributed to register around 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the measures adopted since 2009 have driven of 17% the rates of enrolment of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Moreover, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States in order to reduce the period of vote by anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in anticipation were African-Americans, while they were only 13% of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the same with Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In return, whites which were 76% of voters were only 46% of voters voting by anticipation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the legislators, Democrat and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects of law have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Advocate-General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 on 34 States have enacted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with picture.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The criticism Democrats advocate denounce the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key States.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Centre Brennan of 2011 demonstrates that the Member States that have adopted these laws are 171 of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test results would sometimes misleading, with false results negative or even of false positives, which lead to unnecessary of medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to move from screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a great deal of contamination between the groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study European one, has concluded a difference of death among patients who have had a screening and those who did not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40% more chance of having of metastases if it is not uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if a parent who has already had a direct prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">African-American men of origin are also more at risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision once we have detected a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancers aggressive and others who are indolents.</seg>
<seg id="13">It really must understand the patient the degree of risk his cancer, offering him the possible options, not treating necessarily prostate cancers which do not infringe to life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men in which we detect cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will suggest to the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, it determines with accuracy of the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I therefore recommend to pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should move or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Society of urologie, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately there is no miracle formula for preventing cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We believe that if everyone ate well and move sufficiently, we could prevent 30% of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">'If no longer smoke, this rate grimperait to at least 50%', underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Company of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain unexplained also fully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Society of cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for several other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This is damaging to the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">'F today, 1.5 million of smokers in Quebec' deplores the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of smoking, the risk of dying of cancer halved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The embonpoint and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.</seg>
<seg id="36">They accroîtraient the risk of breast cancer, colon and the rectum oesophagus pancreas, and of the uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">'The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity during a whole life protects against colorectal cancer' ajoute-t-on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The body also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too much, it increases the risks to be achieved a colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The charcuteries also, and they should be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of meat by lived or drying curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">'In recent can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer', can we explain toddler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between the supplements vitaminiques and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their research, however, are not conclusive for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one of them was a reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talk about its concerns and his family origins with his doctor.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs husked</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the likely Higgs has created quite a commotion the summer, and to cause.</seg>
<seg id="3">We believe that this mechanism boson is responsible for the mass of all in the Universe, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or 'least bad' explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists, it is not yet entirely sure whether the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without any doubt that we take a genuine new particles, and that it is very similar to the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, new data revealed this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but we still lack of data to be absolutely certain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem insignificant, and see what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world, a law inevitably essential that two things cannot be at the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">No way to break this rule - and do not try too strong, you will do badly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the physical world is a very strange, it turns out that it has also a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same area at the same time if they are in the same 'quantum State' - this' state 'of roughly in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, physicists classify the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner, there is good citizens appointed close, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the other are the dirty sifting, a gang of anarchists which have respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same place, at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These detected then fall into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, elsewhere) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: the mésons, that we cannot tackle here, and the 'particles of force', by which the major forces of nature is spreading and which the Higgs is somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons-là, we must stress this here, are not all of the poor little bugs also alien as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary: the banality photon, or 'light' particle which is the 'messenger' of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When, indeed, a particle having a burden of electricity or accelerates change of direction, that '' the scope of electromagnetic in this place, a bit like a pebble launched in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This' disturbance "the electromagnetic waves (light, or, infrared and ultraviolet, etc.), and this is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, a force of sifting 'with'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Scope more stable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies with the Higgs, this difference is that this is another field, the scope of Higgs, which must be 'disturbed' for this boson arise.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, this scope of Higgs is far more stable than the scope of electromagnetic; for the whip up, we must achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a pond frozen which only a very big rock could Rider the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why it is a huge accelerator of particles such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of outer circle! - to achieve such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the scope of electromagnetic again is useful to explain the report between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">This are not all particles, or all materials, which interact with the scope of electromagnetic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as the magnets, do, but other not - a piece of paper, for example, will never itself on a fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same way, it is not all particles which interact with the scope of Higgs: those that do have a mass, while the other (as the photon, want) have not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what does' can provide 'all these research, Mrs Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also enables us to examining any gap between the comments and predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also several hope fervently that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a 'new' physical and plugging holes of some Modèle.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must say, has still huge shortcomings, proposing no explanation for the seriousness (oups!) or the dark, which form around 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But it has not found such differences at CERN until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Repercussions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The repercussions of these research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs street, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not.</seg>
<seg id="35">Take: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser, in the Laboratories Bell, do not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself has developed the first laser continuous (the first were pulsés), in 1962, initially the laser was rather seen as a 'gimmick of labo'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And then, the applications can also come from all the instruments which surrounds the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small sensor of light in 1969, during its work in view.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although this was not at all its original intention, is now 'eye' to all digital cameras of the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physical 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...</seg>

<seg id="17">Reversing the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">'It depends on the ability of the person' to accept the regression, identified.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the heart of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who enter the House of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses that surrounds them does not mean more care so-called 'therapeutic'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is dying 'aware and suffocated'.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease, I took my children.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">To Victor-Gadbois, it provides, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid for food.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are palliative care, that it is when there is nothing else to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the lives more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, there are a palliative care for 11 700 people.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little when we know that we all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the House.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the level of comfort or physical, emotional spiritual.</seg>

<seg id="42">Alongside an old man 93 years which are relishing their final assembly of family in the Court, of stalled in its oreillers while it is falling in its credit, a young man of 36 years tragically dying, surrounded by its parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">'For six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by the cancer under the age of 45 years', is concerned the Dre Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the House Victor-Gadbois arrive home, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to a palliative</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadian simply do not have access to the palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient is reached the final stage of his life, whether at home, to hospital or in care homes.</seg>
<seg id="47">And various bodies, as the home Victor-Gadbois and the League of palliative care at home, the Grand Montreal specialise more or less exclusively in the care for cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebecois of who fear of several specialised doctors in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, a manifesto, signed leading experts the palliative care which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to the Dre Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecois of is not good enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to the palliative care of quality before we agree to carry out euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, it says, I saw a patient move 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, to make the necessary for the relief.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the same time, several oncologists act on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.</seg>
<seg id="54">The expectations of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it has abandoned chemotherapy challenging one.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I announced my oncological I arrêtais treatment, she told me that it regretted that I shall stop to fight, she told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, it had told me that I was over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Not care all-powerful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Dre Martel believes that 90% of patients who want to die thanking carers of not having agreed to ask them after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But we must say that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care to the League of palliative care at home of the Grand Montreal, patients would be reluctant to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors have so often palliative sedation, which amounts to hijack the patient until his death, is intermittently, be permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, the sick not relieved will have the possibility of having this sedation palliative.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: 'I want to die.'</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean 'I want you euthanasiiez' means' I want to be relieved '.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">'The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season, you have taken a new scale with the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by an awareness of the individual but also by the new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I move at their side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff I have also contributed much.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a daily basis, these elements lead me to put my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, in the match, it is easy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything will very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not catch fire.</seg>
<seg id="12">My start at the centre of préformation the INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always put forward by gradual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You are therefore benefit of competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruits this summer are used to argue matches very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a player as I want to face and provide the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is supported by the assistants as Claude Makelele, who was at the same position than me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the man of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti respected in all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, it has not matched by League 1 and part of the best European trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has great experience and has gained a lot of securities with clubs brigade.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has passed through major players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think it will win other headings to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I say a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that it gives me also explains my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How would you assess the first part of the season PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">League 1, in Lyon we took the place of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final 8es with the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">Firstly, we want to finish first of our chicken, in Porto, to receive in the 8th final return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The PSG can become a great European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">It has already the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris needs win securities and to be included in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to fruition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In League 1, not win the title, as the last season, would be a failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would represent a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, we really have at heart to pocket to champion.</seg>
<seg id="46">The last season, it is not gone far.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities finally first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It has done a very big season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be champion...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I believe that this is the right.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you feel that the media PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is only natural that we expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and players that we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">We fully accept.</seg>
<seg id="57">After, when you earn 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to reproach ourselves, it is certain that it is somewhat frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people expect more.</seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win 4-0 all the weekends.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to implement a project of game.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is being built with the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">It was shown in the Champions League that we could respond.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City which does not happen, since two seasons, to qualify for the final 8es, they have also made huge expenditure!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points forward to the truce!</seg>
<seg id="66">It was neglect our opponents and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not the last season, have been inspired by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the League 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we can have the smile saying that, despite all the difficulties, we have ultimately prevail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems totally dependent on the deeds of you Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much the better that we say that there is a 'you' dependence.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that have very good and that it highlights many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It is time for it and it shows that it is the star of the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">It has demonstrated wherever it is past that it was a great global player, a star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the group, it respects human rights and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">It also respects men he has around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">It pushes the other to hoist their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How do you lived the 2012 Euro with the French team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I had to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me to garner the time of game.</seg>
<seg id="84">I have seen things there and I am emerged stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I have to achieve good matches selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">That is what I had hoped for my baptism with the Bleus.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learnt lessons from what happened in Ukraine and today needs to have an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">How would you assess the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Bleus?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It has the results for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is well placed in the Group of the word for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The sélectionneur is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the gains.</seg>
<seg id="92">As was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">White had achieved its objective by calling for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that will lead the Didier Deschamps Bleus Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The good no (1-1) reached on 16 October, in Spain is a founding match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone has fought for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced match the same in my career.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, of transactions identified and the costs of treatment between the stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a protocol of exchange for the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files hand in hand in hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Around 200 000 transactions have already been registered with 15 000 computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">A small thousand Web sites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The price of bitcoin, having achieved a summit of EUR 30 dollars (23 June 2011), has fallen to USD 2, five months later, before going today around a dozen dollars (are recorded on the site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing very impressive, compared to the world trade in real currency or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes bitcoin as the 'virtual currency with more success', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the conventional currencies'.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as the 'appropriations', used to make progress in a video game that you earn playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social networking site Facebook has also developed this kind of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, every time, a central authority control and trafficking trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin, all the difficulties of the network are both depositaries of the book of Auditors, Auditors, issuers, and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users actually between two e-mail address to the way of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except that a user can choose an address different for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of encryption to double key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded exist in the book of public accounts and broadcast in the entire network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The milestone is to write this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It involves the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and which the winner, provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of hachage of file, i.e. transformation of a major file in a digital footprint shorter and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers' take 'the new transaction and add a number of grinding' before '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim being to find the number who gives a hallmark (many zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number found, the other difficulties easily check that this is the right.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any change would change the mark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have fingerprints different.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer having resolved the challenge is to win 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, this prize is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cent millionth, which leaves scope...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the challenge is also raised at every increase in the power of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the deposits bitcoins in stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">'The should be used is not the Protocol itself', ensures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency Bitcoin using the network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB is also of the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this service anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash also has this defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">Serious players like Wikipedia refuse the donation of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Other, as the platform of blogs WordPress, accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Institute Weizmann in Israel, have analysed the book of Auditors and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins is not passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, 'balances giants' have been launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">'Thirty thousand dollars have been traded' welcomes Jon Holmquist, which works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins of gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Stone Noizat, who also has a pedagogical Paper on this currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">Its system Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, and which are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The bearer manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement the traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to communicate a telephone 'can only a snapshot and recognise', precise Pierre Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend of questioning the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">'It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point', prédit-il.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB, in his report, is to reassess the different risks, now considered as high, in case of success of this currency.</seg>

<seg id="5">It is time that the Afghan army take possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expect all of us.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is particularly the Afghan peasants that we have punished in the recital as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former Heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign military presence, as the time of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Arab, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajik.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolerated, sometimes aided by the local insurgents, they will not be when the West will be more modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, that I have observed the top of hills almond trees planted of thanks to the appropriations French, has done in order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Convoys of lorries and tanks joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There will be no flood of the Taliban on Kabul at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since their advanced irresistible from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, the country to blood and fire in the struggle between various factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their control of the country was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers overtaken by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">Old mujaheddin, current Afghan government and Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main notable war anti-Soviet returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have calcified into business, seizing land government to sell them in land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American 'contracts of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are déconsidérés; most of them have not fought themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of war and ideologies.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have passed through the modern world in their exiles in Iran or in Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="26">Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul account now 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the cities, the government schools are full, girls and boys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will provide work for these young people who want more return to the obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of leaders.</seg>

<seg id="32">The former commanders of the fight anti-Soviet care already to rebuild the provincial militias, which will in the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, land of mountains, the strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, to the image of Western nations, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state, strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not control foreigners in particular to the elections scheduled for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country is, since the 1950s and well before, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">No industry has been called in road, no dam is in a state, no system important irrigation is repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is left to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country devastated by thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Noise has been widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">This has only add to the feeling that the West 'were not there to take them over.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to treat the iron ore or copper on the ground, or transport to the export through the mountains, there is no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine for Mes huge Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) search the immense Buddhist site and remain the largest employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day we will have to also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The departure of the French troops ended on 20 November.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: school of girls and boys, the French department University Institute, French, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the Delegation archaeological.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009, to try to win the hearts and minds and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, a service of civil-military 'actions' of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and carry out by a small French NGO, a lot of work of collective interest and rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.</seg>
<seg id="48">This work, energy-intensive 'local labour force, were able to help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, trees, soil protection and increase of farmland.</seg>

<seg id="4">Taking all the world of short, it announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly vote its final text tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago, the leader of the state had given a further two months to this House to conclude its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That is almost two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text, which weakens amended several times this institutional stability and leads to legal complications.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only increase the gap in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For its opponents, the President is persisting in its' delirium autocratic 'continuing' betray its word 'and' trampling the law '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The side of its supporters, it ensures that it is a means to put an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">A referendum should be organised in the fifteen days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short space of time which obliges the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For President, it is also a way back to a popular legitimacy and democratic while dissent is raging throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview to the US weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">All that this appeal to a hasty vote is the ultimatum to Egyptian people: 'Either you vote for my text, I am full powers', these supposedly take to end after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in a very strange that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, to great Islamist majority, the text voted yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the Liberals were missing from the call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had bolted, believing not having been able to assert their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that the quorum to be achieved, 11 people, members of replacements, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that Articles have been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators have scorned the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... the time of prayer, some members of the Committee considers the pendulum of the constituent was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was still 'be voted yesterday evening, contains 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Deal of attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that the 1971 constitution, stating that 'the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law.'</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of 'Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace' the principles' by 'the rules', which would have enabled a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and their respect for other components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">'hypocrisy', meet the Liberals, who do not see that a communication.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, according to them, Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They include Article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly as regards checking the compliance of laws with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the expert in Egypt Sophie apple, it is worrying because 'people called has decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the beginnings of a theocracy '.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals are also aggravated by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">'For the moment, there are no concrete religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not of Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system 'dampening Alexis Blouet, which is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But it recognises that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220, because the words borrowed religious term.</seg>
<seg id="37">Reference is made in fiqh 'especially' [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the issue in the future could ask ourselves how judges civilians are competent to decide on it '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers that it attaches to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are considerably reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Other contentious point: the powers granted to the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Council of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Neither will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These are also part of their concerns about the text, they deem liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, of the press in particular.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, no article is no longer response to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Whereas Egyptian President must speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The support of the head of state défileront them, on Saturday.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the Members and the human rights activists polémiquent on this that will give the law on the linguistic test compulsory, fraudsters selling of 'false' certificates have already made their appearance in the countries</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only aim: to earn money to help their families stayed at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since 1 December, a law came into force and states that every migrant worker will have an examination of Russian.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the moment, this rule is that those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, services for individuals and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, with the time, promises the Service, the federal migration tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It will have to validate its language knowledge in Russian for obtaining and renewing its work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Are exempt only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">People with certificates or education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of centres of examination will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of friendship of peoples, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of St Petersburg and other institutions of higher education.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants can pass the tests in all the cities of the countries: more than 160 centres have already been opened on the entire territory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This initiative to introduce tests has been supported by the Members of the State Duma and Federal of migration.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, before the law in force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what does it will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What is the obligation to know the Russian change for the Russians and immigrants?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Firstly, meet the representatives of the migration, it will reduce the number of people suffering 'of slavery at work'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Much talk of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the office of the Russian Federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of rights must start before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organised selection will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to pass dishonest people who, under the pretext of the help, will give him a 'trip' in a crowded maisonnette where he and tens of its similar tourmenteront for months without food and without Paper and slave between 12 and 14 hours per day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Vividly them, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, it is their passport, and they do not affect the planned 'salary, confirms the Head of the Directorate-General of services of migration for the work of the service of Tajikistan, migration Tolib Charipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I do not stop, Mr the policeman!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, many of the people of the Central Asian republics who wish to earn money in Russia entrust that they do not only the language of the countries where they want to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen Tajiks, Uzbeks, can afford to follow if only a passable primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Indeed, their families have not even what feed their children not to mention the dress properly and equip them to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">They arrive in adolescence, these young people leave earn money at the earliest opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult when we do not know the language, confient-ils.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Do you sense fallen and diminished'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Defenders of Human Rights notice, however, an important aspect of the law on the language.</seg>
<seg id="35">The tests are intended purely for migrants who have a legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">Without status, there will be no official examination or work.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">'Welcome to enter or defence'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason? the administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 million rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And then we can obtain a false registration quickly to only 1 500 ruble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police know that we have of false documents, that we have not recording, where the case of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">'They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea', has entrusted to journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov national, Tajikistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Soon, 'do not then denied and achète-toi a fine work of art'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that papers registration of migrants were not the only ones to be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several false certificates examinations of languages have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Service of migration.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fake papers leave a printer ordinary colour.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: every migrant who hoped and to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The representatives of power and defenders of Human Rights agree that the short-term aim is to protect the system against corruption in that it is impossible to simply buy these 'piece of paper'.</seg>
<seg id="52">The authorities can give the migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to attend language courses.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, immigrants who do not know the Russian will be proposed a work in areas that do not involve actively communicate with the people.</seg>

<seg id="1">United States: the employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost a quarter of US adolescents pass through a cashier among McDonald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">These days, a wave of protests against the low wages is practised by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such that McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell Wendy' and, if Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take the scale or halt quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations of the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alongside the modest increase salaries received by the employees of basis among Walmart and in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations want to achieve the creation of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving the 'black' Friday, when a rain flood of balances taking million inhabitants has befallen America and triggering sometimes esclandres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs in the world 2.2 million people, have left their post to organise of picketing with the unions and the left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended to consumers of small and medium-sized classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart commercialises everything: sections guns hunting in the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many employees poorly paid in Walmart shopping solely on their workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The price and the choice of products made Walmart one of the groups most powerful in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Critics Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap particularly because of low wages of its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">These latter complain also difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or air-defence scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the manifestations of 'black Friday' demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the cost of insurance provided by the company had increased 30 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the employee basis among Walmart which affects 9.5 $the moment, it is a sum that it cannot afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California Berkley show that if the average wage Walmart increased to $12 hour, it would cost $3.2 billion in the group.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is 1.1% more of what he spends now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart transferred all of the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the shop their would be to 46 cents.</seg>
<seg id="22">They will spend in one year only 12,39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine Member States and have been no harm to the group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 'black Friday' continued in the shops 8h the evening at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold on this period 5,000 articles to the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its coffers have done in any 100 million transactions for the 'black Friday'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The spokesman of society Dan Fogleman has ensured in an interview the site of the left Huffington Post that in any less five 'employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a' operation 'COM among many others' from the trade union organizer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">'customer following!'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York and were not more shops Walmart (in this city gradual, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet established) but the McDonald's and other restaurants cheap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do not even give you leave disease and do not pay the work that you honestly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a Member of the New York City Council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage provided by the federal legislation and New York is $7.25.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food the increase with the time, but little, on average its employees are plumbing in New York 8,90 $time.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody is less than them in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For me it is inconceivable to live with this in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It was a time when nearly a quarter of young people working in American McDonald's after the school while living among their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Today, I find myself interviewer McDonald's employees who complain to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.</seg>
<seg id="38">Secondly, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you will be the feed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The demonstrators who have launched the movement on Thursday at 6h30 almost McDonald's of the 40th streets and Madison Avenue cashiers and demanded that the cooks the fast-food are paid at least $15 of the moment, is a proliferation of more than twice that the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They took to the unions are created in the catering sector rapidly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a trade union by bullying or redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, the administration their simplifies rarely life.</seg>
<seg id="43">For a trade union, to grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main is the extraordinary turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They do not agree</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other stormy protests were held nearly several other fast-food chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The time a beacon of protest has been the gathering in the middle of day almost McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several policies, including local Democrats Jumaane Williams, a Member of the City Council, who said: 'McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do not even give you leave disease and do not pay the work that you honestly!'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by other New Democrats, particularly by the candidate for the office of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that 'we must all support the employees of the rapid restoration for they get a fair pay and the economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The New York Times has characterised this demonstration as the most important in the catering sector rapidly in its history.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people participated without count that not everyone was the bar, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">At the moment, it is difficult to say if the spark of mass movement will be small.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">'For the moment, is they-not to deceive the brain'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Recently, fans of new technologies are used to collect the reality increased through special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the outset, it is Google which has unveiled this been its current model at its annual conference and in November we have learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, it is the conversation with the Director of the Group of the laboratory 3D technologies interactive Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists from this society, glasses are already history.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air to bare hands, by creating virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- would you tell us in a few words what your group of research?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying in the same time to extend the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The whole of humanity remained at the moment the pixels on screen sometimes the flat and tactile.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess the radical changes which will occur with this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the equipment and sensors Xbox Kinect are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox is now selling without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order for the gesture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">– What we reserve also the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">– Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, much is happening on screen dish, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that and we are working on imaging 3D systems really operating on various technologies, including technologies projection.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the area surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, we can complement the real world by objects in a virtual form more practical.</seg>
<seg id="18">And to begin, let us get rid of these stupid helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">– What do you think of the voice of order?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is appreciated, but is it not be overestimated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">We cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we have not always want to inform the other of its actions or its intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, every kind of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not gestures, but rather to gestures discreet, restricted.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not caught by the camera of the apparatus, but by a blow to the police from enjoying the movements of bone and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is currently great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a shows.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint order, for example: gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- It is to say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">– By example, how am demanderiez-vous you can pass this?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will do this with the floor and with the gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- On the habit, I am speaking only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be difficult to recognise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- Well, you want to force people to adapt depending on what the machine can or not to a given moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not only, but it is a rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that very soon we will have to work in the drafting of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be sensors for example, they produce a good resolution in depth and it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">– If one is interested in your work on sensors Xbox Kinect, what you do not like in the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">They lack of depth resolution, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are working in our work on the recognition Building.</seg>
<seg id="39">It would of course to get around 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 that /.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">In relation to this last point, all the current technologies are good enough, this adds the work the designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must bear in mind the resolution says the axes X, Y, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed is also very much, the number of frameworks to the second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 that / is really not enough, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our Redmond laboratory has given to reach a delay sensors regular treatment between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would need a device of this kind in my work, but not requiring touch, for more frameworks to the second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Why should we not increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect now has three 'cameras', which is in fact an issuer infrared and the second signal, a receiver of thought.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is a sensor's usual scope visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not to define the depth of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">Many cameras could solve this problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or the worse by increasing the volume required of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras and to see how this could help to define the locations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- Autant that I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of technologies of the reality, the increased glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, walk all the time with a smart phone the catch-the-eye is not practical but what I believe: the best option would be a reality increased 'transitional' which would enable you from a platform Cloud to move from glasses on smart phone.</seg>
<seg id="58">The apparatus glasses are a very personal and that makes their personal force (the elements are those that you are the only to see) and at the same time its weakness: the reality increased from glasses you will not work on objects virtual in cooperation with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">– Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographiques objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also the mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensations!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group working towards in relation to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">– In my way, I often say that the reality increased is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I believe that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the moment, one of the technical interesting is the use of the second hand to serve the basis of image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is perfectly the pressures!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there is also of technologies that are actually designed to provide the palpabilité to these 'pictures in the air: for example the interference of several shelves ultrasound directed towards a specific point the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of air on the ends.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also many poignets bracelets which affect the nerve terminaisons fingers, they are also an axis of work with prospects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">– And you tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To believe that it feels that it should normally feel when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is still behind a task on which there is still a long time the evil: how to believe in someone is physically in a very small area that it works in an open area almost endless - we are working on the concepts of carpets of race (nothing to do with those which are found in the clubs fitness), mobile platforms and also of playing giants.</seg>
<seg id="73">For the moment, there is they-not to deceive the brain, it still leaves many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what makes the work on the virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: many things are still the state of absolute fertilisation.</seg>

<seg id="7">It is one of the conteurs pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance fact smile the inhabitants and putting them in good humour.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has recently taken in its hands a culmination of Barbary and it has become the symbol of this instrument in St Petersburg since it had grown up enough for this difficult role in its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohémien.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why do you read through the city whilst red and not in yellow or blue Turquoise for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> I chose the red as specialised in the fashion designer aspect and the image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if in society, everything that is not grey raises the aggression and a negative unrest.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="16">The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> – And when as-tu understood that you had to be painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - At the exposure of culture Nevskiy where were my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have understood that it was my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then, the wave of old painters unofficial is past and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I began to link of friendship with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to 'Pouchinskaya-10' and then there has been no vague.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am interested in the theatre, the way, music, all kinds except the words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> – And it is in your Clinique artistic... - It was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I have taken taken place to Pouchkinskaya-10 which did before the work a club musical and artistic, a club bohémien, the home of the Czech Petersburg.</seg>

<seg id="26">Chnour and his friends singing songs easy in play-back in shirts moulants, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today to the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group has started to happen to live, it has become 'Leningrad'.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trakhtenberg little light before the time of Hali Gali.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have given them Trakhtenberg and then its great careers began, but its training and education, it is here that it has received.</seg>

<seg id="35">This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="39">I shall have a museum exhibition scheduled 'The Russian through the clowns'.</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns belong to a category timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it is afraid to be as well.</seg>
<seg id="42">But with the clowns, disappears, the tragic grave.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have some ideas grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the idea of saving the world through the total nakedly and compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, it is the cloak which is important, it is interested in external mechanism, but not in the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">Perhaps that we cannot give him the hand, but that we have to cough up to the tronche.</seg>
<seg id="47">And falsehood will be wiped out by the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> You – Recently we have seen in the role of the high player from Barbary. - A cultural city must have this type of heroes.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who else can play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - but perhaps that the art trade can also be nice?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Today the art trade must be treated, delicate liquoreux.</seg>
<seg id="52">A disintegration of culture is happening.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before, people were divided in herds, the supporters of the Czech loved one thing, the dumb another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a ticket 100 dollars to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today, we must think about which you're going liking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Star every 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - but many thousands of people come see Stas Mikhaïlov!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - This are people that we have thrown who come to see, this is the social side and that works.</seg>
<seg id="60">But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately this is less of management, money, either.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have my fans, the main it is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I peignais tables a collectionneur has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the tables which usually are those that are painted in the end of life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, we often confuses the ideas.</seg>
<seg id="65">We said: there is the spiritual culture, the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a representative of the culture of yesterday I grew up with the example of painters living in poverty and die in poverty and who refused the money for precisely the paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">I am for this culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, that is missing in St Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> – From good experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is this concept: the official culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But all cannot work in culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under the rule of good Tsars, this was not like that, the Tsars do not understand the culture, but they understood that we should retain the good experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, today there are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people here in St Petersburg which could be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts to assess properly these experts and their fraieront a path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Currently, this is the 'rule of taste' which is rife.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - To you, what is that St Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - St Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there has to Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for this.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our stones, the art is hard to grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil and we have more writers that readers, that is bad.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there is a curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">Here, this is very thin layer.</seg>
<seg id="84">We must make the art in the way as was the case at the beginning of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="4">Of caravans of space shuttles with people on board go in search of a planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save humanity, a large question arises: how can we continue to live our species in perfect weightlessness or on a planet of aid?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I believe that it is not much choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis.</seg>
<seg id="8">'It is Venus and Mars', is Vladimir muted, researcher of the Institute astronomical of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">If on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, surface temperature Venus is 500.</seg>
<seg id="10">We cannot live there in the very high or on the orbit of Venus... in the area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">We began to take an interest in matters of reproduction in the area by focusing on flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is still half a century, we carried out experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown into orbit différenciaient is in no way of real estate markets varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Secondly, it has put into orbit of insects, small flies drosophiles breeding.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, eggs of quail were sent in the area to see how an embryo weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It gets to the exit poussin a perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is then that the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">'The problem is linked to the fact that the poussin must find a medium, there must be put on its feet and start to move', explains the Director of the laboratory of the Institute problems médico-biologiques the Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">By no means, chicks are agitaient disorderly.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 p.m., the new born saw their instincts entirely atrophy.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks do not react in the light or her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, they were dying simply after quattre days.</seg>
<seg id="23">'We have écarquillé me twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there', explains Vladimir Sychev confirming the failure of the experience with the chicks in the area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last 'organic' miniature arch with animals has been sent into orbit there are 16 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">The experience will continue in the spring 2013.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the 'biosatellite Bion' will not of species of the same sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experience with rats sent with their foetuses in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, we have discovered nothing surnaturel.</seg>
<seg id="29">'It was still biosatellites and this is the only experience. It must carry out this type of research', remarked Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing, rats of the area have given birth to their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is no trifling matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">Unlike the animals, the man is able, in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Homo sapiens has the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional.</seg>
<seg id="36">This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women are going in the space for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the female body is that humanity has more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our mouette has disappeared and person on earth could not say whether it would take after a flight in the area.</seg>
<seg id="41">If it could give birth to a child after the flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">'Nobody responded to this issue', explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a pensioner of the sector of rockets and space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just one year after his flight in the area, the first woman cosmonaute Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father, Andrian Nikolaïev was also cosmonaute.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice into orbit and have even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have little, even very little cosmonaut which had nothing and that give rise to a descent into full health after long flights.</seg>
<seg id="48">'And if they are more long, this presents a risk even during flights in orbit', concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the hero of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, humanity should seek new solutions in biotechnology, the protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Laboratory hydrology of the Centre of preparation of a cosmonaut: binding stage of preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here, in flottabilité cosmonaut is zero, the lead to the exits extra-véhiculaires.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water emulating the perfect weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreigner, for infants, it is their real element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small men amphibious seem to confirm: life on earth is the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Insofar as the baby is moving around nine months in the cash lymphatique's belly of his mother, it is easier to get used to water.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is logical in principle, since its birth until its first round, there is only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">'It is very little to forget, explains the instructor swimmer for infants, Marina Aksenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, if the child just born the perfect weightlessness is a state more natural, the woman needs of gravity, a force weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the womb, muscles, basin is atrophient very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.</seg>
<seg id="60">Good agreement, ignore it on the basis of simulators childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">Of course you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out.</seg>
<seg id="62">'And then?' request Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If it does not feel the attraction land, the body does not form the skeleton neither the muscle system.</seg>
<seg id="65">We cannot pay an infant as an adult with a combination for the special training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">'And this experience that we will have to consider in this case in imagining the birth of a child in an environment will lead to the return on Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté', provides for the Director of the Committee on bioethics médico-biologiques problems of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The birth of children in the area is still theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, with the time it will become reality, when the US will be in their commuting to a distant planet which will become the habitat of their offspring born in the area.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the Institution ISC (higher control of public finances) said: 'the control of the pseudo self-employment (Czech' system Švarc ') failed because of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has inspectors competent and high-quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That is what was said Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Institution greater control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">'The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking at home', said in his comment Kala of the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A control carried out jointly by inspectors Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He mentions as an example of abusive practice the approach of 'Švarc system' by Petr Nečas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister recently said that the ODS not going to upset the entrepreneurs with controls; it is permitted or forbidden?</seg>
<seg id="8">'The law must be applied in a way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to act to inspect to demand respect for the law', note Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the monitoring committee to the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in which have been compared with the laws in public procurement of these two countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was in practice?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and special national legislation and practice itself to follow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences we have arisen: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps more severe and 'better', however, according to certain parameters, as such is best practice in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This therefore confirms that it is not enough to draw up rules are constantly increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What this project can help you specifically and résulte-t-il for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A joint monitoring of this kind should contribute to this that we stopped we try to clarify the laws, to fall and to improve the thresholds, when this has not a truly positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The principle of good management means obtain the thing in question to a reasonable cost (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape, that those who seek loopholes will be much more opportunities than if the threshold was remained highest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a form of organization different?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As regards the institutions, similarly to the works there the Bundesrechnungshof ISC, which is organised similairement, it also has a board been a bit differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally in a similar manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The competences are also, in a certain extent, similar, with a nuance, however, with our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has therefore also of Auditors of this kind at the level of individual Länder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The BRH can only monitor the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of Auditors of the Länder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As regards the national legislation, is simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often seen as a model but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, we must also say that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the public procurement law, its effects are already visible?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet impact on our control operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we are doing a posteriori inspections, it is with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Our comments relate to, for the moment, the process of preparation of the future controls - we have launched a new instrument of 'detection of risks of bad management' with which we have watched almost 14 000 public procurement - that these changes will of course, because the thresholds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to respect them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (for example the Regional Council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) recruited the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it useful to make the law more severe in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">No, not this way, I think.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to tackle the system or abuse but not punish those who commit of formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will increase pressure on the administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So what is the solution to cope?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Look at where we will not.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS not going to upset the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system Švarc is banned or authorised?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be applied in a way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent a authority to act to inspect and demand respect for the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It can say: 'We are going to change the law and allow', but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on the markets has rules fairly strict on the formalities to do and this, precisely in order to protect the tender.</seg>
<seg id="52">But furthermore, it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home.</seg>

<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest said: 'In together, we want to collect the positive energy'.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is only one of these alarming news, the kind of trap in which we love fall.</seg>
<seg id="4">In our group The TAP TAP, rigole rather, be said that we are the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Moreover, you go up in December a project is unique: three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you offer in more detail this project to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a charity that we are preparing for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the timetable Mayan announced for the 21 December at 11 p.m. 10 of the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The eve, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, Prague, and from someone from Ostrawa Brno.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will virtually at a time when will end the Mayan timetable on the island of Kiribati which is in the ocean, on a peaceful time zone in advance of 12 hours a report to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who has had this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially I think it was my idea, then we have designed with our Creator, Augusta Honza.</seg>
<seg id="13">Outside the fact that we want to collect sufficient positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, reflect the state of the world that we leave our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the timetable Mayan, we have created a unique collection of objects, in particular T-shirts, shoes, bags, and key original against the end of the world, in the buying online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The TAP TAP with other interpreters has also seen an anthem against the end of the world who is entitled 'Ending world cancelled' (in Czech 'Konec světa zrušeno').</seg>
<seg id="16">It is already very popular on YouTube, the entendra-t-on during these concerts charitable?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not place...</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be chantée simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anthems are also to join a given moment in the framework of a direct entirely unique, the Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words of this song have been written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the main role of Jesus in the sound bite, Xindl X is please also...</seg>
<seg id="21">How are you prepared to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are working with other figures from the Czech show-biz, because we have many events and charitable concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to get them intensively to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It transpired that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working to the achievement in the framework of the Institute Jedlička, with the association TAP, and that for six years.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers are regularly to the pupils of the Institute Jedličkův and propose that the activities of interest and enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to attend courses, we are trying to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the completion of the construction of the Institute Jedlička, we will transfer this project in a new building independent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Several groups of music and interpreters will rise on a stage at each of these expectations?</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria, have you the chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to draw up a programme addressing all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, get on stage Chinaski, Support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Preparing also to other "mega events' of this kind in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we shall play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here too, we will prepare a programme with guests interesting.</seg>
<seg id="37">We should also play next year in the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played by example in Madrid, London, Brussels and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP TAP is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you manage the organisation and logistics of your eye?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so terrible that it looks at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five Members in which the electric chair gear must travel by bunker trimbalons, of course we also many boxes of luggage and instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">So here is always more or less well past, and British Airways ČSA were always fully prepared for us, they have surprised more than once.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion toward the disabled and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was your experiences until now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better that we have just witnessed in Moscow that is all is only in an initial phase.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people; there, it is not yet know that a person moves only in electric chair in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">They do not yet see it as self-evident to give priority to a person in seat in the lifts.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things for which we are still lagging behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are still dependent on the efforts made by the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not very often there that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The TAP TAP, are rather the contrary to the forefront of progress!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really begin to change when we have among us of sportspeople, artists and actors, politicians or the famous jurists.</seg>
<seg id="57">For the moment, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong desire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The TAP TAP is currently very popular, reverting back to a few years, what you pushed in 1998 to create this group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I have started to work as an educator to the Institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And as I myself am musician (I plays, among others, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created an activity music.</seg>
<seg id="61">And then, with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little lost control of the situation (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The success that has happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, creating links with singers known and to work actively to the promotion of the Group has helped us.</seg>
<seg id="64">We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the substance.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality of teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">You aim to achieve such a level with The TAP TAP?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the outset, I felt that there was a potential to change things.</seg>
<seg id="68">The show business is full of things which copy from each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Few are the original projects, and I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned of all, that we must take pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course.</seg>
<seg id="74">I often say that when people with disabilities are to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Is it that your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you have described by many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a degree of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realise that they must come to repeats twice per week, follow the preparatory and spend much time on the roads for concerts, they will lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve the objectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The group The TAP TAP are currently twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already present in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">A single, Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open-ended Group, people come and go, we can do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="84">Our doors are still open to those who want to or might wish to join us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the case the eve of the day to the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 a.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">This action will be held in Prague in the arena Incheba, Brno to Fléda and from someone from Ostrawa in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other players Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected with audiovisual when will relay chantée jointly the song of the group The TAP TAP 'Ending world cancelled'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim is to bring together the financial resources (to EUR 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo in Prague in the institute Jedlička.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The price of a ticket to this together is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland has been recognised as twentieth Member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic has become a fully-fledged Member on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland had begun a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has participated in a number of projects of the Agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">The road of Poland into space, however, has started much sooner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they had not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to mention, for example, the Conference of A. Šternfeld in the Observatory astronomical Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his book of vanguard entitled 'Introduction to aeronautics'.</seg>
<seg id="7">The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left auditors cold and years later Šternfeld is rappela that only the doctor Jan Gadomski is doubling its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, Šternfeld got in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book 'Introduction to aeronautics'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagateur of Astronomy and aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">It issued hundreds of articles in the newspapers Polish and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski has become a propagateur of aeronautics of world renown, his contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that his name has been given a cratères of the hidden face of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 1925 was built in Poland a draisine intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is unfortunately not the author and the details of this project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the rocket should serve to propel or curb the draisine.</seg>
<seg id="15">The only known about this draisine are those of the press of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research were conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with teachers and Gustaw Mieczyslaw Wolfke Mokrzyckiego.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is of the documents held that this research had reached the stage of trials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, with the arrival of the German armed, research is are interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the plans of hunting a rocket photoélectrique, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, emerged in the press and the following year was published the book 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza' of an author so-called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">These two projects had intended to military use of the engines of rockets.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the projects to use of the technique of rockets were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ('Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy coordinated'), which all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation the beginning of the war ended its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After the war, other work on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautics society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time, it is question of a society in the number of November 1954 of the newspaper problem, in which there are four more detailed articles for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of these articles, by Professor Mr Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to aeronautics</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had of the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautics society (PTA) déploya efforts to enter the Federation international astronautics (created in 1951) and from the autumn, the regular PTA in became a Member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the Federation astronautics international.</seg>
<seg id="30">It conserva its function until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch held on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">This rocket a range of 1 800 metres was a length of 80 cm and a little less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently, was built an improved version RM-1A and, during the summer 1959, test flights of the two-tier rocket RM-2 were initiated in the desert Bledov.</seg>
<seg id="35">This was a rocket length of 1.4 metre and probably 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prototype following should be able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should be made up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the altitude.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1963, all the work of development were halted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period 1962 - 1965 was followed the first type of rockets RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">This rocket, designed with two storeys, had a total length 510 cm weight and an initial 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three models (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were notable for the dimensions of the space for the scientific tools.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket Meteor-1A had an area with a volume of 0.4 litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this amount was to 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum scope to all these types of gear was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period 1965 - 1968, the rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aeronautical Institute, the first trials of flight began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a burden useful to 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently were built the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is important to mention the entry of Poland in COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the Soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Mr Remek, the second cosmonaute non-soviétique of this programme.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court has annulled the law on the work of public utility.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is certainly interesting to examine this issue of a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of economic competition unregulated.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means that economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the free movement without limits) of private capital ally unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The significant differences in the price of work (wages) generate tension on prices.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be put under this term the significance: a producer is striving for the import of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in 'making it more expensive' the price of competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and increase its own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy low prices, or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in the countries where the price of work are high in comparison with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given that the private capital has no responsibility of the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment that it generates, the social costs of the State necessarily increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">This whole situation intensifying the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is such a point well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies create a situation in which the governments of individual countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.</seg>
<seg id="16">This manifests itself mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to compel economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, especially in the field of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is happening on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there is for years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are already by million the number of these people.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees receive such wages that the State is forced to pay extra for they reach the bare minimum.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliary the Federal Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economy measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century), or just stumble along with starvation wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.</seg>
<seg id="25">We must ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty go from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the media say, to get tired, that the state cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that the planned economy led to an economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by means of regulatory intervention.</seg>
<seg id="30">We must then ask ourselves whether the private capital does not influence and, even, is not today, according to its own selfish interests, the policy and by the same, the entire state.</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer to this issue is certainly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is that there is a lobby virtually omnipotent and present in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a desperate situation is demonstrating in the area of corruption, by granting reciprocal benefits, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of projects of laws to firms closely linked to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These projects of law are then adopted in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">The whole of power is not the people, such as the State Constitutions of Western, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled 'the crisis of the Roman Empire during Caesar and Pompée': 'The State was long in full decline and functions were allocated by violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and the Stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.</seg>
<seg id="39">The buildings and corruption has collapsed without limits and the people were the elections with voices already sold '......' The people honest does not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State were 8 months without consuls'... 'It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we should choose a man energetic'... It is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar which has changed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In conclusion, as in antiquity, the society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="41">In essence, the private capital is no longer capable of understanding and to assert the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="42">As a result, today, as a decadence without prior elites, without any effort to carry out reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation of unscrupulous economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state of affairs, we can see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies such as a sort of pause before a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the current elites completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises which we are today witnesses and crimes against humanity, such as we know from history and recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally that the European internal level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is indeed systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution lies in the socio-political for reforms, which will increase investment in capital of the State in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society in favour of the state.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily the history of a struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or if they were to their actions to the throne to someone who ran their actions previously defined objectives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration creating certain powers was not to be at a single generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The families with a huge wealth is particularly the family Rothschild, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude).</seg>
<seg id="14">Little is written on them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the 1990s the nineteenth century, they have acquired the first World (Reuters news agency) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their behalf and serious criminal acts which they were involved and who had always meant for a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have major holdings in almost most central banks of the world and preparing or lead wars against countries in which they have not yet such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq to 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian Government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of Central Bank and began to make during the civil war its own money (government, I hear) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to make money own and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, Mr Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 then that he wanted to initiate proceedings against the EDF for provoking the great economic crisis of 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for power at global level has resulted in the years, 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a a initiated in the 33rd degree, as the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate the British colonialism, in particular, and the third should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such an amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme is nothing other than the beginnings of such a solution) and, ultimately, acquire an absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method used by the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent that are not repeated crises like those that they began in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Having managed to trigger the First World War by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand Habsburg Austro-Hungarian to the throne, destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War is perhaps a capitulation by German economic and military without justification (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia), and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">For a start easier to the Second World War, bankers have left the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have imposed on the one hand, Germany non-traceability war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalisation of the impoverished masses (then it is enough to put a leader sufficiently forceful, showing the finger of blame, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia comprised of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which should play the role that it was indeed) (fifth column to put the hornets ’ nest and a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations of a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local population Arab began.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The second world war broke out; it is difficult to assess if Hitler has broken the channels in which international bankers the had initially; or whether everything he has done was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Jews in Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations for the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially based in 1948, the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were to the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel has sparked a hotbed of fire which could cause a third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers manage to war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of fighting, this time of the population generally Arab or Muslim the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is as a huge laboratory, the source of contention and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it is enough to see how people fall hard between supporters and defenders of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong according to a circle of violence and where there are, to the origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We must make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers did not propose to the people in the elections that their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of politician fascisant, loyal vis-à-vis international bankers, which is all to start a war with Iran, which could, because this country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran control the Strait of Hormuz, by which passes 20% of all the world oil (this corridor Shipyard has a breadth of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Under what light now appear to the comments made by David Rockefeller in 1994: 'The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order. "</seg>
<seg id="39">In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world in which any new born is located at birth an electronic chip making him a be completely controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film ARGO: when all is worse, call Hollywood.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a host of demonstrators composed of Islamist students took to attack the US Embassy in Tehran and retint hostage 52 diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange for, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, which, after the Revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation did not offer to the US administration to positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to obtain the release of hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow for the prestige of the United States, even worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate inspired the United States with a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The ARGO, the film actor and orchestrator Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this history that a small victory in America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before it is occupied, six employees are fleeing from the embassy.</seg>
<seg id="12">After many vicissitudes complicated, they found themselves in the arrest of the Ambassador of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring them out of Iran with a bizarre coverage: they fled the country with passports Canadian as a team of film come to repérages for the film of a film show of science fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Gender combination</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez requit the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to make the legend more credible, specialist magasines did state of this project film, presses conferences were held and a society of shadow production was real offices.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation remained long secret, the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film of Affleck unusual is a combination of various kinds.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a part of a thriller policy designed realistic but also a 'caper movie', the story of a coup, a treachery - as, for example, in the trialogue is Ocean' Eleven store, and twelve Thirteen.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ambiances place: sequences of Tehran of style (in the documentary subtitled sequences are presented photographs iconiques of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these pictures, these situations have been recorded in the film, there is no major differences),</seg>
<seg id="21">Some passages more light of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,</seg>
<seg id="22">And then scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with men costumés discussing the situation around tables conference in the corridors and the telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to get his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">Derided player, it became a orchestrator respected player and its game has ceased to elicit ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO is its third long-métrage after the dark policing 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007) and the thriller 'The town' (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is also the first to film Affleck which is not taking place in his home town, Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics which put its first films above Hollywood standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in ARGO where the role of Tehran 'is held' with Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film are taking place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a place, has written a page of history.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the scenes fictitious (the false camera crew in the bazaar of Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many actions to too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The orchestrator had simply a matter is in fact that few scenes exciting film, in the sense of the term.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is doing very well, it adds sometimes certain elements to the reality and the result is not always equally elegant (stage in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the runway are rather far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of ARGO lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to be too of events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is true that Alan John Goodman Arkin and are completely charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved greater prominence and these are not far from it, the only in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film of Affleck lack a little of tension dramatic, it is a moderate interest in appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">It leads to the spectator, but with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of a story again, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, it is the case.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which leads every year a public inquiry on the bank charges the more absurd, has now decided to launch the help of the Rules of Procedure or ideas from the 'workshop EU the most absurd.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">'The fact that the EU is, recently, adopt a quota of 40% of women for the direction of European big business has been at the root of our decision,' said for the newspaper Právo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nonsense mentioned, there has already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, however, women were an advantage in terms of tariffs on the life insurance because they are, objectively, a risk to the insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">People can point out until the end of the year any other idea incredible of the 'EU workshop'.</seg>
<seg id="7">'The vote will take place before the end of February 2013', has informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add fuel organic components, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of mercury thermometers reliable only because they contain a relatively low a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of conventional battery hens, which has led to the increase in the price of eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism has also been made in the past against the ban on use of the expression 'butter to chocolate spreads' or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Bananas of quality must be a size of 14 centimetres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial and industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of States (and the Czech Republic is currently the demands of its banks in threatening to use its veto).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of lobbies are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be of a size less than 14 cm or present a 'bendy abnormal'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission has defended in arguing that it was not doing that harmonising national standards not homogenous which complicate the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some Member States, claiming that the existing directives entail a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The first prize may be awarded in this EU regulation of last year that should be on the balls gonflables a warning that the children of less than eight years should not inflate without monitoring of adults.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU has made reference to a US inquiry that the balls are among the toys, the first cause of death of children by choking.</seg>
<seg id="17">A restriction similar applies to children under 14 years in terms of trumpets blowing in curiosities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here too, we have ideas bizarre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name 'Macedonia' and must, instead, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In cooperation with the 'applicant' Let Make of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the regulation of the Union on the size of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic dépassa secondly, for example, the volume set for the mushrooms canned and risqua, this fact, a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organisers of this investigation have seen interesting idea to pay money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy to ask the granting of subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas are not, however, from Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">'The not having sea we handicaps.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are going to ask the European Union a refund '. This is expressed, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">It argues that, the fact of our production of cereals, and following the so-called 'purchases interventionist', the state of stocks was found with full that it had then export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and involving a tender for the purchase of wheat from the maritime country.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for obtaining subsidies have been proposed by the Ministry of the common Development led by the local Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to draw up the demands of subsidies by Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU says: 'the bizarre regulations are rare'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU regulatory and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its development rather general, deserve praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The fact that the Czech Republic should, as other EU countries, fighting to Brussels for the right to use of specific names to these traditional products (fight that it does not always winner) arouses strong emotions amongst the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', for which the name of 'Tuzemský Rum' which dates back home in the nineteenth century, our producers have had to replace it by the name 'Tuzemák'.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only products from sugar cane alcohol, and not of sugar beet, can bear the name of rum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of products registered of the EU is today with world-renowned as feta cheese or gorgonzola, the massepain in Lübeck or of Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (the 'Karlovarské suchary'), the carpes of Pohořelice and Třeboň ('Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr') and hops of Žatec ('Žatecký chmel').</seg>
<seg id="38">Bread of épice of Pardubice ('Pardubický perník') and the cake called 'Cornets of Hořice' ('hořické trubičky') can also be proud of their Community mark.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Mr Senator, how has the idea to present the presidential elections?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is not to be Senator or president who account for me.</seg>
<seg id="4">If all worked without problems in our country, I would candidate nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I do more to see as the country is plundered since the last 20 years that thieves are not in bars and taxes and the age of retirement increase.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not have the ambition to become a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that does not please me, then I am trying to provide a solution for change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as I have more than forty years and that independent, I am a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that I present the presidential elections or Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You entered in the Senate but you have put quickly for the Castle (n.d.t.: seat of the Presidency).</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you do not turn our backs on those who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have always said that I am sending in the battle for the Castle according to the results of senatorial elections</seg>
<seg id="12">Subsequently, I have said that if I was elected Senator, I shall be presenting the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">My aim is not the function, it is merely an instrument which will allow me to make my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is why I need the greatest influence and mandate of the broader.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not only as a nation we râlons in the bar or to our television, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to the press which destroys the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying.</seg>
<seg id="17">It has, for example, said in my remarks that I soudoie journalists or that I have been the advisor Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Turning to your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You began the fight for the Castle as a battle with the issues of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive of tax returns than 20 million CZK].</seg>
<seg id="20">You must change the law to this end.</seg>
<seg id="21">As President, you do not have such a power and only the Senate in a whole can propose legislation.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you intend to resolve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tourist guides are a liberal profession, I have won.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it is delaying the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As independent, a member of any party, I have a lot more opportunities to obtain the support of all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, take every party what is best for our country and implement it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider rather as a man of right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people have left me rather.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, that this is a little Left or Right, this is not really important.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, the important thing is that we move forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">What matters to me, this is not that people are right-wing or left-wing but to unite people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I still support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I am acting as impartially against bad ideas.</seg>

<seg id="35">When you develop a business plan in a company, you also a certain aim optimal and a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">You are trying to bring.</seg>
<seg id="37">Some may call it populism, but all the proposals which I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament, you have that slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">You do not survivrez long with this policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Do you think that if you will see people and their speak, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">I must convince the politicians, journalists and public opinion and to endorse my side in order to impose it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected President, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">When there is a strong personality which will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take, for example, the election of President by direct suffrage, it has been achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I admit, clearly, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">I have to engage in politics and I am trying to get majority support for my programme.</seg>
<seg id="50">I am trying, alone, to make things, and if it does not work, I will end in six years and I will return in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one person cannot make the difference is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present itself as the senatorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="54">I met Radim Jančura, but it has refused due to the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed fraud with oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I have presented, because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of people have not voted and what did have, for most, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Senate, we are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have elected a Senate, which will be difficult to impose changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite everything, I will fight for my view, for example the election by direct suffrage mayors and of prefects of regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you intend to base your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each Member potential is clean and then I do not have the financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on board 'transparent'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You did not money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about tax declarations, what is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I believe, around 60 million the value of my personal goods.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have in Prague a ground to a value of 25 million, an apartment a value of 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of approximately 10 million, a Aston Martin, which is 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, I have a Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always loved James Bond, which were in car, was galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive your Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you did not money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just imagination. If we look to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">'I think that this building is marrant, it is very much futuristic, finally something interesting to see', we said Lisette Verhaig, enhancing on the slow lane the streets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company neighbour, we said: 'Yes, it is indeed very well, this building'.</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we need yet today a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and of e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries elderly, not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a ville-dortoir which has nothing to attractive the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">The common 80,000 souls employment-creation rate of education the weakest of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To restore some neurons the brains, the city has decided, a few years, to contribute to the general culture and replicate the seven bridges shadow on the EUR tickets in the form of cute toy small armed painted concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the cultural offensive remained restricted.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is how the authorities of the city have realised that there was only one way to resume the statistics: the construction of a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrams in bold and sticks creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual stiff upper lips and the competition was in 2003 with five books in the arm and a knowing sneer on the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Members of the jury is still watching, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brazen, empila its books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and perhaps his speech by arguments activists by a common: 'dear!'</seg>
<seg id="14">It is my proposal for the mountain of pounds of Spijkenisse, or as we said, the Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has bounced.</seg>
<seg id="16">The edifice is part of a project of revitalisation with also an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books has received the second price 'Best Library of NL 2012'.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">That is how this small village dull, which until today had nothing more to offer a post-modern piétonne area and a staggering laideur mayoralty of a white the facades, which call for thinking that they contain a dairy, has been enriched of a contemporary architectural.</seg>
<seg id="20">The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural of its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the reading</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression, El Dorado of the book under glass to cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Admittedly, a lift you transports at the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you are trampling the soil of the building to the discovery of its topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The glass is entirely of light and clear, soil brick Dutch and streetlights elegant unequivocal speak the language of municipal public places.</seg>
<seg id="25">Urban the atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is already looking at the benches, dogs and boys and girls who play the ball.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everywhere, and books, books and books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">'Normally, the library shelves are along the façade and the environment is a room great and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal', explains Willy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have completely upset the classic space configuration and open spaces of reading of the Interior to the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="30">The mountain of books has been skilfully developed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the Club of failures, the Centre for the environment and the technical building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A particular beauty lies in the black the library shelves, which are sometimes of lambris, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes ramps stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">A new experience for the view, the reach and the odorat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and engineers hardened do not want the building materials unknown.</seg>
<seg id="34">'We want to work with of recycled materials', explains Joop Trouborst, leader of the project to the common Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is thus that one day we have found in one agricultural business Friesian an ad hoc waste from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Netherlands, used for the years of the synthetic membrane one millimetre thick as substrate in the greenhouses and fields.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and it is gaining time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can build.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library, the membrane has been steamrollered, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis four centimetres thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the effect of heat and pressure, the 'Landbouwplastic' (KPL) changes colour and turn into a dark material, consistent and resistant, including the smell is both a new car and sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">After almost 500 metres, coffee literary offers us an impregnable view on the city, but also of the Dutch and croquettes ficus in bribes.</seg>
<seg id="43">They create an atmosphere, but above all, contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture content of the air of the mountain literary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations to the soul new</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'It is incredible, but despite all the areas of glass, this building is a model project green', entrusts Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The temperature of the structure is regulated by geothermal power.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books is below a glass of glass, the sun it illuminates little time, even the days of the time.</seg>
<seg id="48">The thick wooden beams of means in relation to the façade of used glass pare-soleil, listening to a large part of the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="49">The prevailing atmosphere is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The blinds fully automated can do the rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the computer programmer septique aforementioned has already risky to enter the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette Verhaig also was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described the Boekenberg as the 'soul finally found' of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a few weeks indeed, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.</seg>
<seg id="55">This allowed to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet completely garnie (today, it intends 70,000 books).</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is a success.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full of all sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">For the architect Winy Maas, 'there is nothing worse than a library half empty.'</seg>
<seg id="59">'I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between every citizen and this new building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if only for the decoration. '</seg>
<seg id="62">That is how MVRDV has reached the main discipline so-called, in the jargon professional, 'the creation of an identity'.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Although it may seem young and educated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is a new starting point for the creation of an identity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Szabo: 'the Germans must play a greater role.'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision is Berlin in a delicate political situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinian State to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was then chosen to abstain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany do not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Berlin must be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But I also believe that it does not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to assert its independence, without, however, be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In the uprising in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, NATO implied this measure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany finds difficult to adopt a clear position on the major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its external policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the lack of common and coherent policy within the Union makes the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans have therefore to several fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that they tâtonnent yet to find this role, but are on the road to a foreign policy 'normal'.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as in France or Britain</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">That means in practice then the term 'normal' foreign policy for the Germans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent from those of the USA and the European partners, including as regards the national affairs.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The German economic interests are, in a certain extent, different to those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany to the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention of the UN vote?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany has first important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">That is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is undoubtedly a decisive point.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, I do not accorderais too important, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this is in any case a key element in the German strategic considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany nuit-elle to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is why I believe that the gap is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps that Germany will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="35">Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are various.</seg>
<seg id="37">By contrast, the United States have announced their veto of a clear voice.</seg>
<seg id="38">Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There has always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama Administration secretly shown great understanding for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from outflank of enthusiasm for the policy of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany finds difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the major European partners?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that it does not make things any easier for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if it were a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot therefore be in a broader political line and have to affirm their unique position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is what they are currently in the question of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">In my opinion, Germany will the future a leading role and cause Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is not easy for Germany, particularly because of our relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This question has always been difficult.</seg>
<seg id="52">But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany will see a role to play an important player on the international stage, Germany is only assume a key role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or has always difficult to play leading roles on?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is always difficult to play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that every time that Germany decides to carry more weight, many feelings antiallemands.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not make things any easier for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must deal with neighbours and opinions very varied, and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Today, the United States' influence on European policy is decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, which remains?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will merely play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="63">And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated, it is life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stephen Szabo is Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and experts in politics of Europe and North America analyse together the challenges of the transatlantic community.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Protection of trademarks' in China: when Puma Armani and suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are the well-known makes throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Armani Polo... what is this really about?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind this name is a trademark officially in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mark and enjoys protection such as the company which bears the name cannot complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even if it could, it is not sure that it would be successful.</seg>
<seg id="7">'It is increasingly difficult for outsiders to protect their brands in China', explains Thomas Pattloch, Taylor Wessing cabinet lawyer specialising in violation of property law in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week, a new dossier is in my office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The copycats only need of a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, instead of Gucci, we are seeing Lu-Gucci, and instead of Wears Prada – there is Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the manufacturer of articles of sport.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a good in which are the registrations carried out with the trademarks agency of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has tabled the marks Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company has artificially created in appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the home of fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and the violation of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities, shopping centres on several floors which sell almost that counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="16">The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its clients the responsibility to tackle the fact that the office of trademarks gives the Chinese official Chinese companies the right to use a designation that is already protected in another country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese speak of 'Bang Mingpai', is relative.</seg>
<seg id="18">The term is derived from 'Bang Dakuan'.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is with this term that are designated women who are married men rich.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities say I have nothing to reproach itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'It is bad for business, we must fight against this tendency', requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">'The is diluted, the uniqueness disappears, the damage for the reputation are enormous.'</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and legal costs amounting to millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the key products expensive.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the society of analysis of the market CLSA, China is, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market of luxury products and that the most rapidly growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, it is not easy to delete the recordings of register of trademarks and these procedures are expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch mentions the trial in which the Court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the name 'criticised had become a reality of the market'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be obliged to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have damaged its mark in China.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this field, sometimes it is the law of the jungle prevails.</seg>
<seg id="30">The famous case also concern graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine Sany construction, the same company that had to buy the producer pumps Putzmeister concrete.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is why the Chinese can use an emblem which resembles the star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely, the acquisiteur of Volvo, used before a logo white and blue reminded BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The House of fashion Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore had reoriented the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing recognizes have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the office would be spent last year of a 'emergency situation in the course of work to normality restored'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the number of procedures for untreated opposition would have fallen by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57,000 case of this kind would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding with the office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Act is costing</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As often in China, the figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications submitted marks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth time in succession top of the League for the number of new deposits in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of law.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, every registration has reported on average 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">A legal battle is costing far more, as the case of the family business German Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For over seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire.</seg>
<seg id="50">Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the imitateur has been able to maintain its mark on the Chinese rights Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">'It is our fault, because the names of family cannot be protected in Germany', explains Hanno Wentzler, President of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trademarks agency was therefore rejected the objection of Munichites.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freudenberg is persevering with the following two bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Vigilance is called for</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident that it believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, it adds: 'the procedure is long, demanding and costing a lot of time and money.'</seg>
<seg id="59">It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The service of archives even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">There are five years, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side 'a large sum in euros to six numbers' to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">'It is what we see what this means for us', entrusts Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">This would be the case if copycats of this region is assuring the exploitation of trademarks not protected.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, a Chinese producer wants to table in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a company of production of leather footwear and.</seg>
<seg id="65">The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was when even prevent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Wentzler adds: 'vigilance is called for'.</seg>
<seg id="67">Pattloch and advise him German firms to be very careful in their trade relations with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international law of trademarks, foreigners should instead 'register also in China everything which is likely to be protected', as stated Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the costs might be much more important than those of registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the last act of his legal tragedy, the company should pay the licence fees to the other side for the use of his own behalf, as explained Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or so, we lose our place on the market segment in question.</seg>

<seg id="16">180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found the godfathers in Germany through the association 'Voices for Africa'.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend secondary education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per least we can become godfather.</seg>
<seg id="19">This guarantees the child money for school, a uniform school and a daily warm meals at the centre gogo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means zoulou 'conteur fuss' or 'singer of praise'.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody can be fluent in the language bantoue in this region, but all can sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in the foreign language that it has led in Germany for now make it to his home region: South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because 8,733 kilometres to flight of bird of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni village, which depends on the power of the German choir voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">40% of people suffering</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The village are roughly 2,000 inhabitants live in, some modest huttes of straw or land and the majority of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has prevailed their parents.</seg>
<seg id="27">To Esitjeni, we can see the small-scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection at the highest and life expectancy the lowest in the world according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population does not accept almost never the male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction proven the risk of infection by half.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a journey of group in Africa in spring 2005, the choir had discovered the village. The Imbongis have seen many children in the streets to which it was not only parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In a poor country, school without qualifications, there is simply no prospect.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning, it was just a few people who are committed personally to pay a few euros every year in order to send a child to school and offer him a warm meals per day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But barely a year later, the choir based 'Voices for Africa', an association which has since almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about the sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Among the IST bacterial, the late-stage syphilis, the chlamydiées and blennorragie (or gonorrhée).</seg>
<seg id="37">The current IST are HIV Human Papilloma Virus, the herpès behavioural or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The hold of pubis and remained belong to the IST parasite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the groups mainly concerned?</seg>
<seg id="40">With syphilis and blennorragie are often among men who have sexual relations with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert-Koch believe that the sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four cases of late-stage syphilis on five declared in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">Adults heterosexual the care-acquired infections, the chlamydiées trichomonase, oral (fungal), the blennorragie and Human Papilloma Virus are sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The rate of the spread of HIV between adults heterosexual is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the young, there is a rate of care-acquired infections chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the European records, three-quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, in Germany, the Human Papilloma Virus is common among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What is the development of the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of late-stage syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there has been estimated 2,700 case.</seg>
<seg id="52">This represents a reduction of one tenth of the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause boil at the level of genital organs, the pain urinary, losses, the pain bas-ventre and the appearance of buttons and verrues.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, they do regularly no pain or another symptom and, therefore, remain hidden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How to protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.</seg>
<seg id="58">The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubrifiante or close personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="59">The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing often sexual partners to move regular reviews.</seg>
<seg id="60">Most of the IST quickly dépistées can be cured and the effects of late can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to the sponsorship, donations, but above all the funds that are reaping the choristes thanks to their voice through Germany, the means are accumulating.</seg>
<seg id="62">'In all, we have already sent about 200,000 to EUR Esitjeni', precise Annette Lennartz, chairperson of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and which always gets what it wants, manages the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It also ensures that the orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers for example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The gogos, it is thus so-called old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that every day they go to school in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">The orphan which has more person is welcomed in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman living alone and is paid by the association, as the two cookers every day that prepare meals for more than 200 starving children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, 'Voices for Africa' has created a school of counterfeited and enabled the construction of two houses. With the help of the Organisation for health SIP, the association has organised a test of HIV testing for many people.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is not self-evident, because even if the disease is visible in the whole country, it remains a taboo subject.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king and its 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">'The AIDS is a real taboo', explains Annette Lennartz, 'because this is an issue affecting sexuality.'</seg>
<seg id="72">It is rather odd, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his lifestyle excessive.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">These mores punished by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV witnessed over recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">Migrant workers have also dispersed the virus throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is nevertheless of condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, 'but almost nobody uses.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different, flesh against flesh '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to promote somewhat cultural exchange, the choristes of Imbongi go together in travel every two or three years in South Africa and entonnent songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that number of inhabitants of the forefront of the black continent are still experiencing the time of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus full of white who sing in African language is a recognition that it creates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes also a tear off to a formidable guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The bus displace them always to Esitjeni, where the choristes visit their godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.</seg>
<seg id="83">'Make to Esitjeni, you find the light,' say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres to theft of bird, back in Heidelberg, before these choristes who gets in the Chamber of repetition of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The tube Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet mercury.</seg>
<seg id="3">The polar ice could achieve 20 metres thick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains water frozen, as explained three studies published this Thursday in the journal Science 'specialised'.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spot Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice coverage in the region of the planet constantly plunged into darkness.</seg>
<seg id="7">This would have a coverage thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Water is probably of comets or perhaps asteroids which would hit mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, no link between the discovery of water and the possibility of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist the spot, Sean Messenger Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature on mercury can achieve 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements to life are arrived in other regions of the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Undetected of the inhabitants of our planet, of probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix investigate the depths of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">From time to time, they send images to land, such small interstices through which there is endless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The image from a photographic system developed by researchers in Germany of the Institute Max-Planck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The eight planets our solar system, and the planet dwarf on Cérès.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Pluton, which orbit around the sun, behind Neptune Cérès is not seen as a 'world', according to the new definition of the international astronomical Union of 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This detail of a photograph infrared taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a portrait of 'family' generations of countless stars: older stars are blue and the points roses, more difficult to identify, are the 'babies' in the delivery room of the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The telescope Spitzer has discovered this region which produce the stars, dubbed 'W5', a name of little romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopée at 6,500 away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The telescope Spitzer NASA photographed the outsider of a star dying.</seg>
<seg id="20">The circle in the form of beignet is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="22">The telescope Spitzer photographed this delivery room galactic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Pléiades, heaps of stars also called 'the seven sisters', can be observed to the naked eye during the night.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the telescope puts more colours in value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">This, the broader infrared of hélice, as a red light, look directly the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is to 700 away in the constellation of Verseau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Its similarities with a continent land earned him the title of North America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The combination of the photograph of the photograph normal and infrared allows us to observe a spectacular colour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Only the detectors infrared of the telescope Spitzer have been able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">One of the biggest puzzles of Astronomy door on the creation of the Rings of Saturn.</seg>
<seg id="31">One theory is that the Rings are the remains of a honeymoon Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion of years without trace.</seg>

<seg id="32">A photographs the largest and most clear that has taken the telescope Hubble is that of the galaxy the maelstrom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to the colour photographs of galaxies, the consequences can become real works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebulous the Trifide in the constellation of Sagittaire, several thousands of light.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word 'trifidus' (divided, divided into three), because three dragged dust luisant divide the heart of the place of birth of the stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Serpentaire: to 400 million away from the Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush to the other, the collision is inevitable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The telescope Hubble has seen the birth of the stars in the galaxy M83 spiral.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use his nickname "wheel of southern fire '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The photograph of the telescope Hubble space shows a detail of the broader the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.</seg>
<seg id="40">The black hole is to 1,400 away and is made up of grain dust are ten to one hundred times smaller than the domestic dust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This picture has been drawn up from optical and clichés X-ray taken by various telescope.</seg>
<seg id="42">We can see the circle consisting of the black holes in 430 million away from the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies christened Arp 273.</seg>
<seg id="44">Scientists have appointed the greatest galaxy spiral 'GC 1810'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this cloud is the group of stars young the brighter lactée of our way.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cradle Heavenly always gives rise to new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">These clouds of stars, which are linked by the cloud of the rosette, create also constantly young stars to 5 000 light years away from the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy to light and rays breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still not dust, there are only gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Scientists believe that it is born after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our eyes on the world: the main telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galileo utilisât a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since, mirrors optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see still further in the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale of the Monitoring Centre on Mount Palomar almost San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror on this image was a diameter of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In the Arizona, the United States, is the Large Telescope Binocular.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors have a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias to La Palma, the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter 10.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been broken up in order to make savings.</seg>
<seg id="59">The diameter achieved all eleven metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of the method of economic integration is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical, which restricts mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope Hobby-Eberly Texas is also set in the vertical perspective.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its feature is its great capacity for collection of light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite a diameter mirror relatively small, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescope to mirrors the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Scientists are listening to the universe in search of signals extra-terrestres of radiotélescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).</seg>
<seg id="65">This radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 metres.</seg>
<seg id="66">Anyone owner of a computer can help the 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' (SETI, or 'research intelligence extra-terrestre') by contribution the power of calculation of the machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">On the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Andes Chile.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the Very Large Telescope ('Very Large Telescope'), a worthy of its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can enlighten the spectrum infrared way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its mirror main should reach the size impressive 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the telescope cannot take photographs by 2018 at the earliest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the volcano hawaïen the KEA Mauna were regarded as the greatest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They were two mirrors a diameter of 10 metres everyone.</seg>
<seg id="75">Telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory on Mauna KEA who observed the sky with the telescope Subaru and IRTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">A new telescope huge should also be built on Mauna KEA and the diameter of its mirror reach 30 metres.</seg>
<seg id="77">This example helps the admire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the images of the most important area we are of the telescope Hubble space.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since 24 April 1990, we book images of worlds away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the space of the telescope Kepler seeks exoplanètes, mainly those who are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.</seg>
<seg id="82">This illustrates the final preparations for the launch of the telescope Kepler space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in the area at the earliest in 2018 on board a rocket ARIANE 5.</seg>
<seg id="84">The first mirror of the telescope infrared space has a diameter of 6.5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="85">The telescope will have a duty to find the light planned by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists believe that the South of mercury is also of the ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, no reliable data on this theory, because there is much more Messenger orbit near the North Pole of mercury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The data was radar for decades the presence of ice on mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the launch of the spot Messenger in 2004, the first to orbiter around mercury, scientists now have the certainty.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The trip in the mountains Talysh is a romantic échevelé.</seg>
<seg id="9">By way of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahote the long of wooded hills, rivers torrentiels and firm modest.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and fertile, you would almost in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But we are here in the South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is not just a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we know little, if this is that they speak perfectly Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very long lifespan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminus: Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small town plastronne with its architecture too aggressive of the Soviet era, which is not at all with the mountain landscape picturesque.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists are rare here, the journey since the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one way.</seg>
<seg id="17">The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country has its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a place tourism.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision, and next year, there will be here the festival of older people in the world', explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is Director of the Museum longevity, the only museum of the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">We can discover the life of approximately eight dozen Talysh of the region, which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.</seg>

<seg id="25">However, there is no birth records.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when we believe that the old person documented had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than questionable.</seg>
<seg id="27">'It is born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973, precise Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man would be married three times and it would have been 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guides Azeri, explains that the Talysh have special genes.</seg>
<seg id="38">By contrast, Fatulayeva, the Director of the Museum, believe that it is a question of food.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The 'Human rights' omitted in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution has surfaced in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rival demonstrations revealed the deep divide the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The draft Constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Egyptian President is not sparing words emplies of emotions.</seg>
<seg id="6">We must manage the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">'And this success is my responsibility towards the people and to God, ” he said on state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was designed for the entire people, but also especially the Copts Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because all the members of the opposition confused and hopelessly divided are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohamed Morsi has said, almost by apologise, have temporarily restricts the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its own 'in order to save the revolution'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, the Egyptians and the world do not know what that wants to save the engineer of 61 years, the holder of a doctorate from the American University of California of the South.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The judiciary be reversed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The 234 articles written by the constituent assembly Muslim 100 people in a tour de force nocturnal fifteen hours are indeed worrying in a certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the case law is based on 'the principles of Islamic law'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But that really means the word 'principles'?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the margin of manoeuvre related legal to apply a strict interpretation of the Sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In any case is that suggests an article newly introduced stating that, as regards all the issues relating to the Sharia, the university Al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the institution most important of the Islamic countries and its lustre an Sunni throughout the Islamic world.</seg>
<seg id="19">This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto the tutelage of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another problematic aspect is the maintenance likely to military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the reign of Mubarak, these courts are employèrent to repress opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator, until 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.</seg>
<seg id="24">The state must also, we read in the project, protect 'the true nature of the Egyptian family' and 'promote its moral and its values'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the state institutions could check the content of the cinema art and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Clearly, it would be simply of censure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead, another article forbidden to offend or to defame the prophet Mohammed or his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, Article does not define what is an offence or how it must be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to 'offend people'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Enough of a caricature of the President or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?</seg>
<seg id="32">Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submitting to the vote and which, according to its own words, will very soon '' the subject of a referendum of the Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'The revolution renait'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The opposition is mobilising for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual concord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the Sharia before it enters into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">'The revolution is resurgent, and we will win', is launching Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and SNC of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is' to throw in the dustbin of history '.</seg>
<seg id="38">On Twitter, the service of instant messaging, he has accused followers of Morsi to foment a 'coup against democracy'.</seg>
<seg id="39">'If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and it will reverse,' exclame Jasser Said, an opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">'We are not even tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié', said in the media Egyptian Khaled Ali, a politician and a Member of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, several judges have announced do not want to monitor the referendum, which lead to the invalidity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">'The Koran is our Constitution'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organised, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised in the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Headscarved women and the supporters of the Salafis, who have participated in large numbers, coined the people: 'calls for the application of the law of God'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'clean our country!', demandaient-ils to Morsi, by saying that 'the Koran [was their] Constitution'.</seg>
<seg id="46">A battle for the sovereignty on the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would have very quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Obviously, this is what the advocates of Morsi wanted to avoid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim Brotherhood have said that the opponents of the draft Constitution, at the same way that its supporters, were spoken loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to them, it is now time to leave the people decide through the ballot box of the direction that must take the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">The project of Islamists will certainly the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">'The human rights are not mentioned only once'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this constitutional process imposed which should continue until February and include all the social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This human-rights lawyer of 48 years and President of the Egyptian Organisation of human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">It did not because it shares their view of the world, but because to human rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">That is why it has been beaten, convicted and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">'And now, the term is not even mentioned once in the new Constitution', regrette-t-il during his meeting with the Welt am Sonntag.</seg>
<seg id="57">The extension of the powers of Morsi the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, whereupon President de facto all its powers' deplores Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, the battle between the different political ideologies on the brink of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could afford.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rakfisk Norway: is it the most fish odorant of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million people in Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetites of premises for a fish extremely odorant?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take some cheeses advanced.</seg>
<seg id="5">Placez-les in the middle of a pile of clothing soccer wet and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wait a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you get the smell of a disturbing rakfisk delicacy, the most popular of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, at around 3 p.m. to Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Snow, the landscape is dramatically - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk consists of trout made and fermented in salt water during a period - according to the smell that you want it exhale - which can go up to a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When the dark is established and that it is cold, the Norwegians gather to attend a festival here, to Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">'You eat believed, then you avalez a glass of aquavit', explains Havard Halvarsen, local fire full-time the so-called 'Rakfisk General', responsible for managing the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us, people consume small pieces of fish and enfilent a large quantity of drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'Some people prefer aquavit rakfisk the', adds Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The beverage kills the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am trying a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid doing so under your nose, this is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi which would have happened long hours in a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in Barriques water impervious to the air, then salé in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Secondly, during the winter, a time of fermented, the fish is lifted and, undoubtedly with the sense of being undermined by alcohol - eaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their countries to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now, the population is growing quickly - more than 13% of immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the top earners and a comprehensive health system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Swedes, their old rivals which the country was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although odorant, of the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is a party of the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="25">But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost $10.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often talk about it in the international news, which is not to offend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here, people are not prepared to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When they talk about this killing, they are talking about 'the incident of 22 July'.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that in their peaceful, one of their could make such a barbaric act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Since the early 1970s, Norway needs its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">'But oil is not the single reason which justifies our success, explains Anna, our barmaids, chevelure blond and in the eyes of a rookie numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk in hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are - how do you say - people prudent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, as that of most people who live here, is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are discreet, we do not like us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously - all, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When other countries laid money around, during the years we have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse of tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">'As we can skiing in winter and make the rambling in summer, we are pleased, precise Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">'Without forget the rakfisk', in a strong-competition laugh careless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am standing in the snow and I am waiting to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the menu, a hamburger composed of impetus, a real discovery, it is excellent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel in which I have been is one of many places is rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most odorant of them.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a TV where the host a door nœud-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk bases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We have gone to the support of the Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'What score have you given the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">'This is our points, Havard.'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We hear of laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man is its Chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">'We are counting on him to establish lasting changes', has declared his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a Member of the Congress and the party of Mr PENA Nieto, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In terms of safety and economy in particular, we hope a real change that our country desperately needs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Private Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, state prosecutors.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors are trying to counter the demands of abuse which Private Bradley Manning would have been victim in detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The case concerns the detention of Manning in a military prison to Quantico, in Virginia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Defence is to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Private Bradley Manning - accused of being the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US army - has missed out on numerous occasions to complain of ill-treatment that it claims to have suffered at its military detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">At cross-examined with Manning, for a preliminary hearing to FT. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein has said that the recordings of visits made to weekly Manning officers for its nine months of detention to Quantico, Virginia, have not shown any complaint concerning its treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The contre-interrogatoire - during a hearing, the defence has presented a request demanding that the matter Manning be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping is in very difficult conditions and has been a sufficiently severe punishment - took place a day after Manning has demonstrated its desire to kill himself during his detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during its service in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">The documents have subsequently been published online by WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At the hearing of Friday, Fein has examined with Manning the forms that the officers have fulfilled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where it has been subject to a maximum prison isolation of July 2010 in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officers have asked questions on Manning and have recorded his replies.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Fein has mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning has recognised that the treatment that he gave its guard was' excellent 'and that the treatment he had in the prison was essentially' very professional. '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms are no complaint for bad treatment, although the officers have directly asked about its prison treatment, said Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning has replied that he had expressed orally concerns about some of the problems and the officers in visit had discussed its concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not presented the problems mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">'They have written' no problem '(having addressed the concerns), and however, this does not mean that I did not raise problems,' said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The military judge. Theirs Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why it was not complained about his treatment at a meeting in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he expressed by writing a few months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning has responded that its intention for the meeting was to amend its status restrictive indicating a 'risk of injury'.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military have said that they had set this status restrictive - a level below the closer surveillance for risk of suicide - for its protection and safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'I wanted to know that the staff that I was going well, and I wanted to cut this status to enjoy better quality of life in my view,' said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning has shown on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer in Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the basis of the Marine Corps to Quantico in Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He declared that we consider suicide when he was in Kuwait and lost once because of the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He added that not having been informed of what would happen to him or of what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">'My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage', said Manning, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought I was going to die in the cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Again, Quantico Manning has said that he had spent most of its time in a small cell – at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning has also added that the only objects available were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or remain extended during the day was contrary to the regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning has also said that when it tried to sleep, it was a light in the eye, lit outside his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the guards saw no its face when it is going on the night, they woken up in order to see its face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The lawyer Manning has tabled a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning has been placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Friday, the judge has also asked questions on Manning on a claim reported in his testimony of Thursday - that having been forced to sleep naked a night in his cell to Quantico, has forced to stand naked before the Guards and other detainees a morning, during the appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning has shown that at no time, it has been allowed to cover themselves with a coverage during the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the issues of judge, Friday, Manning has said that he is deducted from the order of its guard that it must abandon its coverage which could hide its nakedness, but it has recognised that nobody had ordered the reins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Thursday Manning has shown that it had been forced to sleep naked last night, because it would have tried to prove to an officer that it was not a danger for itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning would have said to the officer that it could use its elastic underpants or its tongs to injure, but that it had not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That night, Manning has shown that his underwear, its tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.</seg>

<seg id="40">His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experience that it has experienced during his detention and that it will considerably reduce its verdict if it were to be convicted before a court martial, a trial which should take place at the beginning of next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defence has said that Manning intends to plead guilty of crimes of the less serious and fight for the abandonment other burdens deemed too extreme.</seg>

<seg id="42">The hearing should resume this weekend, with public prosecutors who should argue that the detention conditions were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all detainees to Quantico.</seg>

<seg id="44">The charges brought against Manning include theft of goods or public documents, the collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.</seg>

<seg id="1">My identity crisis mexico-américaine</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico to lack of opportunities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who are parties; they remind the Mexicans difficult times, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette said that the Mexico-américains find themselves caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, before the customs services and immigration, I felt lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs indicate two ways: one for the 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans'), another for the 'Extranjeros' ('Étrangers').</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I am stood still for several seconds, not knowing what lead me to queue.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in the centre of California, where I have been called the 'Mexican' all my life.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a term ethnic, in the same way that my friends of Boston use when they say 'Irish', or my friends in New York when they say 'Italian'.</seg>
<seg id="10">Secondly, I am now become 'Mexico-Américain'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But, here it was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, on the land that has seen my grandfather, no need of special word or link.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or another language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of an indigenous and I cannot lose my emphasis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">When I took my American passport and I am led to the queue 'Étrangers'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique PENA Nieto visited the President Obama, to the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">Usually, when the leaders of these two countries meet their favourite subjects are immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">PENA Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans to remain in Mexico rather than to risk the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">It wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">And PENA Nieto is committed to the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although it has not provided more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States have invaded Mexico and its leaders forced to give in writing half of their territory to the forefront of a gun.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, memories are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elite - complaints on the way in which the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet for Mexico, the relationship the more difficult is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want it addresses the issue of bitterness?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are many.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country cannot offer.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason the large number of cities as Mexican ancestors in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at the moment, in our traced, a person, perhaps a parent or a grand-parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And the more often, this person was a profile type - a little dark-skinned, well-educated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even if we are currently experiencing the American dream, that we went into good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="37">We attach to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class we do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is reciprocal.</seg>
<seg id="40">We remind them a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were the individuals of strain and Mexican not enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">For them, our existence is a failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we will not stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as souls lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife who was born in Guadalajara and which has migrated legally in the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexico-Américains, because the Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and Mexico-Américains are annoyed.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is American citizen, it has the feel part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Furthermore, many Mexico-Américains that I know have not feel part of a country or another.</seg>
<seg id="48">We worship the music of the Mexican Group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in any of the two.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we regard as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the United States, we regard as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And now, complicating a little more the relationship, as I have learned during my stay, some leaders Mexican and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We must explain to our compatriots American that Mexico is a superb countries that must absolutely visit and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">It does not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There are too many bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, if we consider the unequal pay, corruption and drug-related violence that are pervasive, many of us are not persuaded that it is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">You will have to fend for you, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is normal.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of the way in which they have handled the Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members have been treated there has not so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">We might perhaps more 'Mexicans' that I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old grievances, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Not be able to ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">A further bloodshed seems to indicate that such a is vain hope.</seg>
<seg id="5">While remain the same arguments futile to know who has begun, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the city of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But although the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has any shatters, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are overtaken by this regional upheaval.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps that their fight develops a little more.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there is every reason to think that this could help them to overcome this impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war which is no loser or no winner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first sight, it seems difficult for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire given the 21 November is maintained, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a kicking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Have killed some of its leaders and removed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one corner and overcrowded most miserable of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian other faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally.</seg>
<seg id="17">The influence of Islamic of the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regional power booming, once the Muslim closest ally, Israel has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest States more dynamic and the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The members of Hamas may well gloat and say that the Islamist is growing trend around Israel, since the Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can reverse Bashar Assad, and until the Jordan, where Hamas ’ s allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And the more important, on the southern flank of Israel, the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and more central the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, this despot who has ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders refer more easily to the public.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a player that will not be excluded by Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the hardliners in Israel will draw the conclusions opposite.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, America renews its full support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas to be the source of the last wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from Gaza have killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, especially through the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish settlements which continue to spread despite their illegal in international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud party has merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader in the run-up to the election of 22 January, has the hook.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why these fichus dorloter giving them a Palestinian state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they were running the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind the wall and the start that they fall outside the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring change the situation.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if Islamists who take the power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defence budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire which bodes well - and could mark the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should also think about the future.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians from their right to self-determination could create a powder keg which is dedicated to explode a day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need to be driven by those from outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people that each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of land by Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">A hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to people outside of this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which must now undertake to put an end to the movement of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of ground and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs non-EU countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would be much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a sham State to the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Obama has also interest that Israel accepts to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, it has not presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">To return to the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is a very narrow vision.</seg>
<seg id="54">The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.</seg>
<seg id="55">This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">The laws of cigarette packs neutral entered into force in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings and photographs of organs sick cover the packages Greens bleak are all equal, regardless of the marks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This law entered into force in Australia is a first, the logos and colours have been replaced by a Green oil dark and horrific pictures of organs sick and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by smoking of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Outside the different photographs and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the mark, printed in small print on all the packages.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the regime the strictest in the world on packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal Government has said that the aim was to dissuade young people from smoking in removing any representation glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they are ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">'Even when they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,' said the Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, by quoting studies which have revealed, for example, that children brought the crown of a logo to a princess. '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Even if Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would boost the black-market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"harmful consequences of this legislation, 'said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others have said that this law was boosted their activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Import Zico Pty Ltd, small family businesses, has said that the request of cases to cigarettes, particularly in silicon to conceal the horrific packaging, has risen sharply there are two months since British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Britain' is, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, the cases are good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the tranche of people targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of laws Australian banning the advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign Web sites to do.</seg>
<seg id="21">'If you are working in the marketing of tobacco and that you do not have any more than a small shop window for promoting your products, the Internet is the key place par excellence', said, a researcher Becky Freeman public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman have noticed an increase of the contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of social media as trademarks on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">We must ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who love the Marlboro cigarettes and that has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign mounted by an agency?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia has said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force, rather than on the marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Industry has gone up to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new decisions of justice - these countries have said to the WHO that trade is unjustly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have been important trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A decision of the WTO should be taken in the course of the year 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said that the government had discussions with other countries with similar laws on packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada has been the first country to make it compulsory the pictures of warning on the packaging in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tougher legislation are currently under study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia remain untouched by these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures I do not mind.</seg>
<seg id="33">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="34">'You have a cigarette and you this the package', said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a photograph of tumor from the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, it is my young daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, managing the 'King of the Pack tobacconist' in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made too difficult the packages on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">'First, I had an hour to unload a parcel, now, I have four hours' said Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">'The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said: OK, it is good, we must stop and the key under the door', he said, by lifting the arms to the sky.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly connected, it can be good to be boring.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I have spent five hours in an airport during the period after Thanksgiving, because our plane was mechanical problems and we have had to wait for the arrival of another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the subject of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am not going to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">A half-day in an airport to wait a flight is quite boring, even when you books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But increasingly, some academics and experts in the development of the child are praising the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - is boring time to time, they say.</seg>
<seg id="8">This force the brain to borrow the railways interesting, even feed creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And as we are, for most, constantly to several types of screens, we are more the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Then we should welcome the trouble with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, I thought that the problem was a recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the case, declare, Peter Toohey Greco-Roman history teacher at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of 'Boredom: has Lively History' (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'The boredom dates back to very far', he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii were Latin graffiti which refer to the trouble, they go back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Secondly, there is the definition that we give to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, aggregate professor of psychology at the York University in the Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having travelled many publications and put the idea of a group of discussion about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the boredom as an experience which is' to do something, but without coming to engage in a satisfactory activity '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">This distinguishes the problem of the apathy, he says is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would.</seg>
<seg id="22">With apathy, he says, there is not the desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What is at the heart of boredom, he said, it is the 'adjournment of the process of attention, together with a low mood and the feeling that time passes slowly'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The problem can strongly resemble a depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or of the world, while people depressed believe that the problem of them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that we ennuyons when in fact it is a problem of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the framework of their study, 'The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of' Beware, which was published in the newspaper 'Perspectives we Psychological Science' in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted a experience oldest in which participants were listening cassettes, the voice of a person being read an article magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard, from the Chamber to hand, it too high a TV had no report, others have just heard the emission of TV, and the third group has not heard the bande-son.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more annoyed that the two other groups - they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and have awarded this problem of concentration on boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or party, an interruption of attention can lead to the problem, Mark J. Fenske said, a professor of aggregate neurosciences to the University of Guelph in the Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, when you are doing a task boring, 'as watch on a conveyor belts, music can help you not to bore you.'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that when we are tortille or griffonne, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to remain physically more alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and more information than those who are forced to remain nothing', said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all ennuyons a day or the other - the delay of my flight of aircraft, lacking in sparkle user with one voice, a film particularly annoying.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more likely to be boring than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure this, researchers have developed a 'level' susceptibility to the problem in the 1980s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes statements as, 'Among the tasks that I carried out, many of them are repetitive and monotonous' and 'I am so centres of interest that I do not have time to do everything'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to bore more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need incentives many and varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual development and Community the University of Illinois, during which it has contacted nearly 400 young people and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.</seg>
<seg id="41">It noted that 32% of young people declared is annoying to school and during their duties at home, while 23% declared is annoying when they were not at school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">However, 3% of parents have said is boring.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he knew that 'adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level', particularly because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If I based my question: the problem is good for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take risks physical absurd, bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as the studies show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, many philosophers and writers about a link between the boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, which examines the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">'The trouble is the way that the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else,' said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain do not always know what is the most appropriate to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you ennuyez and that you use this energy to play the guitare and cooking, you will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you look at the TV, that you will be happy in the short term, but not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">If your child is weary and that you give it an iPad ennuiera, it is more, but it will not have learned to deal with alone and autorégler, says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And 'this autorèglement happening to a situation to another', he proclaims.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child do not learn only to entertain, it gets more control itself in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think we should see the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">As I do not think that we should criticise.</seg>
<seg id="57">Feel comfortable outside the constant seething reservoir that generate the activities and technology is the objective towards which we should strive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">'We need boring us more often, but the boredom arouses desire acute and frenzied to be connected to something which makes sense,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to what people are seeking, it is a means to disconnect and appreciate the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">'In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés', he added, 'it is difficult to find ways of engaging in something when noise stops.'</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, 19 years, in a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged for something which will soon become a legal state: in its possession of marijuana regard and pipe used to the smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco said that one day, in September, and a few friends were on board a car Lamar, in the middle of fields, near the border with the Kansas, when they have been arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4">After that the police officer has found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco has received a summons for possession of drugs and material used to its consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">'We are treated as criminals,' said Mr Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But what a?</seg>
<seg id="7">During the weeks of uncertainty which followed the vote of Colorado to legalise the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low use of drugs is more dependent on the place that the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without result.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police have ceased to indict adults of 21 years and more minor for possession of marihuana, because the law comes into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the prosecutors who are in the constituencies more conservative of Colorado called to speed up the existing marijuana Affairs and continue to indict those who possess.</seg>
<seg id="11">The same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the opening of shops sell marijuana registered by the state in their neighbourhoods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">'The things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what we reserve the future,' said Mr J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, is in Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The regulatory bodies of the Washington State there are also many questions.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are in search of directives on the way to establish a system of permits, to produce, manufacture, sell and distribute - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most of the States in the regulation on marijuana, firstly, concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now as regards personal use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator', said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.</seg>
<seg id="17">But no place or system, recognises Mr Smith, can do no more than suggest what works.</seg>
<seg id="18">'There is no real precedent on which we could calculate, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, which is I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vacuum a year, during which the system of licences does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the State which guarantees adequate access to marijuana licensed and prohibits the installation of shops of sale of cannabis within a radius of 30 km radius of a school, to a park, a playground or a crèche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to install an authorised trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle', has declared Bin Livingston, a spokesman of the Centre of legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, the leader of the police, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to its officers' City announcing that the US Attorney '(representative of the public prosecutor) would be more people of 21 years and more with small quantities of marihuana, and that the police should stop charge of people for this type of offence' to 'immediate effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new decisions of Justice which regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it will continue to pursue the drug traffickers and drug dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">To Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the US Attorney '(' district Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken buck, embodies a more stringent.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marihuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users to désintoxiquer.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marihuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">'Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those people who have committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was an infringement recognised,' said Mr buck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas as Mesa County, where the voters have rejected the initiative in favour of the limited use marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police to Great Junction, the greatest city in the county is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The representative of the public prosecutor, County Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the cases of detention of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">'I do not have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it to change', he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and government appropriate personal use marijuana is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions which have been observed in various US cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials as regards the legalisation of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">'It is a cultural barrier' with the representatives of the public prosecutor has said, Sean McAllister a lawyer in Denver, which represents the people accused of consumption of marijuana, and which is expressed as spokesman of the local 'National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws' (National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">'They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who consumed marijuana, too, have difficulty in accepting that it is legal,' he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first States to deal with the restricted use marijuana at the same level of alcohol, Colorado and the rule of Washington are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While defenders and representatives of the state for a new frontier of sales legalised, they expect with concern the directives of the Federal Government, which is always the sale and the culture of marijuana federal as crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The defenders of the legalisation of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite some high-profile arrests of patients in marijuana therapeutic and sellers, the federal government has enabled the shops sell marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">It is true that the police is unlikely to seize the small packs drugs, it is likely that it opposes the shops sell marijuana authorised for personal use authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser policy of the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Many cities of Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Well before the votes, some local administrations have approved moratoria on the creation of new businesses of sale of marihuana, even if it is only a postponement of one year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the city of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">'We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves in a federal problem,' said Mr Nicholson, a Member of the town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our Community has voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are interested in the vote of the Community rather than the vote of the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">A lot of questions arise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wyatt Petronella: I have been bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a 'Tory' (conservative).</seg>
<seg id="2">It is not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As far as I remember, I have always dreamed to enter the Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and my older brother have studied in what was a prominent place to know, a sort of Greek amphithéâtre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, two weeks after me to be installed Worcester College at the end of the 1980s for study history, I have decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and came to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard has claimed that I had left the University, because I had objected the fact that students the first round had sexual relations in the Chamber to side of mine.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after having been forced to drink in tasses ébréchées.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="11">I have fled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I have fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and is subject to constant bullying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my name rather extreme, or because of the fact that I had a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in the birthplace of the so-called know, I have been the victim of racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised of Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why mention this today, you may say.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students centre-right suffers the same kind of persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The growing hatred and institutionalised Tory students to Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, at the same as those gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Conservative Members of the Chamber of students (JCR) of the corpus Christi College have said they were 'often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable' because of their political opinions.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want that there is a representative in the Committee of the university to equal opportunities in order that their opinions can be freely expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Rights' ('The country wonders: young, intelligent and right wing'), on the policy among students, and that 'painted a graphic picture the Tories' as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It found particularly the student Joe Cooke, former President of the 'conservative Oxford University Association (OUCA)', which moves in Rolls-Royce, bears a comprehensive well-off and moves with a rod to head chromée.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, students Conservatives say be treated as scapegoats of the implementation of the increase of tuition fees. '</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the 'Nottingham University conservative' Association, has said on a Sunday newspaper 'there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People think that we are as the Club Bullingdon without even we have encountered. '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 years, student in history to Corpus Christi, which has tabled a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is' and ', uncomfortable Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, President of the OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR people who are centre-right.</seg>
<seg id="26">'This is an obstacle to the freedom of the debates intellectuals, and the welfare of Members' she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I was the only to think that during my first weeks in Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came in September 1986, I was aged 18 years and a crippling timidity.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary doctorates, because of the reduction in financing of higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere was charged with vibrations Stalinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">From the first days of the host week, when the new students have seen with the other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what will happen afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="33">I have discovered that the teachers were not only the sarcasm to students Tory, but that they were fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It was as if the policy on the subject of minors strikers, privatisation and the opposition from the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was set in the timber from classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first ludicrous which I have been the victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the eighteenth century, and I was not prepared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">'Miss Wyatt,' said the teacher Harry Pitt (now deceased), 'please translate the first paragraph'</seg>
<seg id="37">I have lost touch.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a small man in the face pustuleux, is easily outweigh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">'Are the Thatchéristes refuse to learn the French or are they just stupid?' he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students have amusement.</seg>
<seg id="41">The tears I were being destroyed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="42">'I suggest that you take of French during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy you make friends', he launched a snarling bearskin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I am turning in my room, inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the dinner that evening, I am only then I felt a slight attack on my shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a student in the second year of studies of English, appointed James, which is presented as a Member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know that you are ', he said, gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">I am afraid that.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is already quite hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will therefore be even harder for thee.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, the local pub cowardly, I have tried to hide.</seg>
<seg id="52">I have insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that was said by Mrs Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student at first year of philosophy, political and economic science, ironically, studied in Eton, said: 'You are the daughter of a pig fascist'.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students have included the tune.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverted dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">'How the Tories are love? "asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59">They affect each other, is it not? '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt as homosexuals before the liberal law of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">I would have only been able to lead a normal life to Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dusk?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I have become Labour and deny my views?</seg>
<seg id="64">The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history, who taught in my university.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was detested not only because it was conservative, but also because it was in external policy adviser Thatcher and one of the authors of his speech.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was almost never here.</seg>
<seg id="68">He disliked this place provincial and insignificant, and its accession to the point of view marxiste-déterministe of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a university teacher of Bilkent in Ankara, in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">'You do not become happy here', he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I have begun to shuttle between Oxford and the House of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends urban more open mind.</seg>
<seg id="72">I said in my father that I hated Oxford and I have explained why.</seg>
<seg id="73">It was sceptical.</seg>
<seg id="74">During its studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all the political points of view were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">'But that is the best place in the world', he said moving pleas.</seg>
<seg id="76">They do not do it, not in the city the spire dreamers.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends Communists had ways beyond reproach.</seg>
<seg id="78">He had tears in their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="79">Laisse-leur a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that this is to goad.</seg>
<seg id="81">I would break the heart if you leave Oxford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Tired by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and has abandoned its convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a sitting of tutorials the following week, when a teacher of history has suggested the most serious of the world, that I was' a people's enemy ', I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="85">Internally rougissant of shame, I have admitted be victim to brainwashing of my parents and traitai of 'old' mad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is my father who drove the last nail my coffin oxfordien.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch every week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was frozen.</seg>

<seg id="91">When they are parties, I made my suitcase and I have taken the first package for London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I have never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can address wimp pleurnicharde.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no child of 18 years should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.</seg>
<seg id="95">The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys a solid reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">The profession the hardest of the world: mules human Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, the carriers of the volcano Indonesian risk their lives and their health by 70 kilos of sulphur through footpaths escarpés stone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living in the sulphur content of the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">It must work every day until the substance of the crater, where gas sulfurique from the vaults of the land solidifie contact with the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After having seen large rocks of sulphur, which are in total almost 70 kilos, it develops in two baskets in bamboo that this burden on its shoulders through footpaths escarpés.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is only 250 metres until top of the volcano which stands to 2,386 metres, but the exhausted are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a rate of tortoise, bearing the balance and not for measuring their not stumble and fall into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that a false not could cost them life, as has happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen there are several years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Minors of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once, we find a path between tourists who photographient as if they were circus animals, and the heavy painfully baskets, they walk the 3 kilometres up to the balance that a mining company has established a little below to 1,850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating the volcano since 1960, and we can say, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5) euro cents per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sells then rupees 10,000 (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry ore since this is very much present in the daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, of dynamite and being used to launder sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">'As we move around 70 kilos, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (EUR 3.8) to every journey', explains Anto, which operates in general three trips per day.</seg>
<seg id="14">All it takes three hours and it ends up, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems to be a pittance for such a superhuman effort is triple that it would add in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="16">'The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) by day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (EUR 167)', says the bearer used as a bricklayer who worked on the island of Bali tourism.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, their salary was to 75,000 rupees (EUR 6,20) by day and the job was not as difficult, but income Anto is close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near of the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: 'I have espoused a girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced Java for it to converting to Islam'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto is suffering from asthma, breathe with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">To 27 years, it has spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to pay the bill although it covers the face with a special and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto suffers from asthma, breathe with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that it must pay to continue its dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">I will work even two years, because I want to open a shop or study the Spanish or French 'promet-t-il English in a more than acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">By life, this young engaging and intelligent could be guide server or tourism, in a hotel receptionist, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey.</seg>
<seg id="24">It shares a timber masure unhealthy with other carriers, rose every day to two hours of the morning because the sulphur does not cease to discover the night, when its colour yellow characteristic is blue and is conspicuous in the middle of the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">Defying the darkness Anto staying in the crater by illuminating with a small bottle set to his helmet, he has bought himself with its own money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 carriers responsible baskets of sulphur on their shoulders over the substance of the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mécanisé the extraction of sulphur to save the costs and provides no equipment for carriers who work on board and are paid to the burden.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, they do not affect either a under of rupees 30,000 (EUR 2.50) to increase by camera in addition to the entry of rupees (EUR 1,20 15,000), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists come to a snapshot of the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">'This work is done for the animals, not for human beings', protest Madrusin, a bearer corpulent 42 years working to Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he has left the College.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is capable of making up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not work 'as long as it can', because it needs money to raise its 3 son, aged between 10 and 18 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not be retiring, I pass here because the volcano is all my life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eye when the tide is turning and trap minors in the thick columns of smoke which fall outside the volcano, if they are hardened that no one complains suffer serious diseases... which are of course, their usual arthroses respiratory problems, pain, in its knees and the shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years, can only take 50 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, and his companions extracting 15 tonnes of sulphur of the volcano, that three lorries transporting the warehouse Tamansari, to 18 kilometres away by a footpath goats invaded by weeds.</seg>
<seg id="35">'I will not be retiring, I pass here because the volcano is all my life', says Unainik by opening the mouth, providing several teeth missing.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mother of its five children, aged 30 years, is also working as the bearer of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation a most difficult jobs in the world that are mules the volcano Kawah ljen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of video, hope to draw attention to the problem in a funny thanks to this advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its director creative, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music for the people to fulfil their duty 'national'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is intended solely to the Internet, we have therefore been entertaining and make fun.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the main problem in that country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the field of birth and we felt that it was a subject that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried several things as the launch of perfumes phéromones or organise speed-dating events.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were creative, but they have not necessarily work.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have therefore said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem to a rap song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The government of Singapore do not take more seriously.</seg>
<seg id="17">He spends USD 1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers gives up to $15,000 by child, longer maternity leave and tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech cité-État South-East Asia, also known for conservatism of its leaders and its social strict controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, is currently to 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it has been above 2, regarded as the replacement rate, it was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why the Singapouriens not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, Director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National the Population Division, says that this is due to a 'better education' and 'a wider choice of career opportunities'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">'This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the constitution of a family', explain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single and delaying marriage and the birth rate, which results in a falling birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at increasing radically immigration to counter the reduction of the population has created a resentment within the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites which is a thinly disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, in particular to the Chinese who are accused of wages down and not to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced last year its worst election results since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Consequences inespérées</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a country, the tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it has started to affect the housing sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authorities of urban development have begun to control the number of small flats, known as' box to footwear ', which can be built in the areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale wins great success.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage the promoters wishing to build large family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the buildings EL Developers society, states that its' letter-box footwear 'sell much more quickly than houses greatest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more quickly than those of greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasuries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, it recognises that the new standards give instructions clearer developers, which was previously a spanner in the works if they wish to propose too small homes in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a cité-État.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the birth rate, in discussions with the national Singapouriens who work in the area of financial centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'The people are very stressed-out, houses are expensive, just as education, that is why people back to later', says a young framework.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">'But for me, it is important to have my money and my time', we declare a young than 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them to have children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, are the Singapouriens themselves have the last word.</seg>

<seg id="41">'The Internet has created as a means to seek information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game', mention has changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras point out that the academic Marc Prensky, which has a Masters Course in teaching of Yale University and author of the book 'native-born and digital immigrants', uses these words to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">Digital natives, they, children and young people who are born with technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">'We, we are immigrants digital must teach them, while we ourselves are learning', it says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It adds that the issue is complex, 'because we are asking them to be a criterion defined on what is needed or not to disclose, to publish or say in an age when they do not have the necessary maturity to do it'.</seg>
<seg id="46">'We ask them too to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, for thousands of friends' strong-competition without thinking about the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality at children and adolescents is to use of the issues are sobering.</seg>
<seg id="48">'their say not to do it serves no', she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Secondly, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you do not raconterais to a foreigner, why the fais-tu on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, this plairait-il you that they publish a photograph of you as a friend that you published?</seg>
<seg id="51">Sais-tu what others publish on you?</seg>

<seg id="53">And also, is everyone need to know what you refer to the time?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">'Hors of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on the social networks', she says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The summit of the Unasur ended without that the Lima Declaration to be made public</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Efe has tried repeatedly access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have pointed out at the outset that it would be released after the closure of the summit, then have said that it would be published a moment on the website of the Peruvian Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">When they have been asked about the text, they have pointed out that its content has been described by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.</seg>
<seg id="5">The journalists have access to information on the summit has constantly been limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day, only the video without his presidential Assembly with the message 'private session, audio restricted' was broadcast in the press room.</seg>
<seg id="7">The little information circulating between journalists have been those data by the press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur who participate in the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The only a leaked document during the day was the list of Presidents present, which caused a certain unease among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who were demanding information more important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Later, the Presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the 'final declaration' the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which has reached the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In October, Peru was the guest of the 3rd Arab Sud-Pays America Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been called emphatically by the press, it had not broadcast the statement also called Lima Declaration, as was previously announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the Web site of the ASPA, we can check that the document has been published in March.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission safe for all the journalists, but they have limited maximum obtaining information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The summit has also concluded with the joint agreement Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague which tranche a different border between the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meetings and declared that they would respect the decision to the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has instituted against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">'We will respect and would leave the verdict, which will resolve the differences that we are today in this international court', said President Humala, alongside its counterpart Chilean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversy, the Treaties and the international courts', has added President Piñera by giving a handshake President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of the two Presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to comply with the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua she considered seriously wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The summit was held without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Paraguay, suspended the Unasur since 2011 following the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not been achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">President host, Ollanta Humala, has been mandated to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after 12 noon in Lima.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor has read the final document in which it has announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars investment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur put in place 'important steps to achieve the aim of the South American citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It informed that action would be put in place to improve the 'cooperation in the fight against insecurity and urban against international organised crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effective the risks of natural disasters'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, 'economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalistic but must help to increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our peoples', has concluded President Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">'We have chosen to prioritise a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... between our countries and generating new economic cycles,' said the Peruvian President, in a speech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the horizontal strands of its territory, since the coast up in Brazil, and that two sought a more important connection with Ecuador although it has not given more detail.</seg>

<seg id="1">'The South America needs to learn how to integrate Europe citizenship', says Rafael Correa.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Rafael Correa in Ecuador, has said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which the 'South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">President Correa, who has participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, has said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans' were killing each other during the Second World War 'and in other conflicts,' but that they were now almost a homeland '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this regard, it has defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">'It must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any Latin American country, as is already the case for the Members of the Andean Community, but there is still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past, he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In addition, Ecuadorean President has shown in favour of the recovery of the Organisation of American States (OAS) with the aim to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who have bombarded us is never compromise, on the contrary, we, the Latin American, have all signed.</seg>
<seg id="8">'It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is to Washington in the financing of the United States,' he said, referring to political asylum is granted by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa ensures that it does not regret its decision, because it has itself not betrayed its principles, but instead respected its' deep democratic values and human rights'.</seg>
<seg id="10">He concluded that at the time, 'there was the suspicion that Assange be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Moreover, it criticises the Swedish courts which has demanded that it meets on its territory to interrogation about alleged a sex crime while the 'own Swedish legislation enables us to do by videoconference, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador to London'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="13">'I have not spoken to him for it is in our embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he had a small problem, but nothing serious lung', said Ecuadorean President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is possible that its physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being trapped in a small area without be able to exercise in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">'That is on the health of any, it concludes that'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa point out that the solution of asylum for Assange since the June in the embassy Ecuadorean of London, which would be the allocation of safe-conduct which would allow him to travel in Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and it stresses that it was discussed in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there has been ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">'The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer for Assange Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures to various European bodies', he mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And he believes that 'if Britain granted the safe-conduct tomorrow, this end'.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as is entirely its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or inertness via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa has benefited to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he has stated that it did not was' the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that are detrimental to the freedom of expression '.</seg>
<seg id="22">'The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,' he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this light, it has welcomed that this is not this kind of journalists' or the bankers and the bourgeois hegemonic countries and which dominate in Ecuador 'and, instead of putting forward his re-election,' it approfondirait the revolution to pursue the path and pave the way '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, in arguing that the agency 'should be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the attempts of disguised coup', because in reality, 'it destroys the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What is more, Ecuadorean President considers' entirely relevant 'the desire for Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment, this judgment is not respected.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a Latin American country and a Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.</seg>
<seg id="29">We must resolve them in their together to overcome them and move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the same time, it is said confident in the right resolution of the dispute regarding the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said that 'it is beneficial that Latin America to the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment if firm that it is'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">With reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to seek a third consecutive term, it has indicated that he saw this possibility 'with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes rather difficult'.</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that, if it lost the selection of February 2013, it withdrawing from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">On a personal level, the power has never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, socio-economic this poverty cannot be resolved by means of political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">'My political movement was believed that it was I who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility,' he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I gagnais, this would be my last presidential term and I will withdraw then political life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, I would also.</seg>
<seg id="37">'It is my decision,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The deaths linked to AIDS are today due to a belated detection.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years when it has confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">'It is as if the sky was standing on the head', he referring when the announcement that the doctor tried to make 'less painful', in vain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man has hidden to his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">It decided to take care of his illness and began to be informed about it and its determination has been such that it has just celebrated its 43rd anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV the hospital civilian Guadalajara (HCG), in which it is in 1994 after many battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio live with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, even the director of a clinic the IMSS escaped him say goodbye 'because it was without voice'.</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time, have AIDS means death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignoring their illness, many people are even when the virus has already caused damage, 'exhausted' their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, 'the great victory is today that the survival of a patient treatment which started at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same', has indicated the leader of the unity of HIV the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a scientific publication prestigious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The expert infectiologue and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that had patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those using drugs: not up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis HIV positive to 25 years, 'as it will remain under control without problems, can live up to 75 years', has explained the scientific questioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to put this progress in its context, it must be aware that the life expectancy of Mexico is today 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is true that the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS is past of 6,678 case in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report from UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients recorded on the basis of national data are dead.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nothing that Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there has been 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines is universal since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So why is there still deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">I believe that the problem is no access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the past 12 years at least, we have never failed to medicines, the problem is that patients are very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or when they learn to the advanced stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It gives us an indisputable 'nine in ten patients come when they are already an infection opportunistic, what we need to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is deliver early diagnosis and more, for this, it must propose screening tests on a massive scale, to all those people who are asking for'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Specialists and the members of the Council of State of Jalisco prevention of AIDS (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as patients themselves, as Fabrizio, which has done its screening test in a laboratory private, simply because a friend had done and that, despite its young age, it was already the bearer of AIDS and had sarcome of Kaposi, a cancerous growth which is one of the current complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die and are not interested.</seg>
<seg id="26">'If I will die, it is better than I am erupts three times per week,' they say, this is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am of the financial year, I take my medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">To this day, its parents know only that it suffers from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I have a normal life, as anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">'I am working, I have many activities, I, I have an active life, but I am involved attention to me and the other person', recounts Fabrizio, which has agreed to share its intimacy with MILENIO Jalisco to help, through his testimony, those who fear today, during the operation of the World Day against AIDS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They make the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are positive and the better, and if they have already the diagnosis, they should know that we can live as everyone, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message summarises the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms on the desk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar Guadalajara, a journalist who have embraced the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the greatest lies in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In all places dedicated to this, 'we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, is now gives us the packages of%, it is very well, but that means that, even today, some have no access to condoms', he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The question: 'What are you going to do?', with ludicrous and value judgments by the social workers, advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that young people do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="39">It proposes to redirect this distribution ineffective; that condoms are not only sold in shops, but that we find them in the public toilets distributors and in places that are young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not of their pay girls and the motel, as had responded Governor Emilio González when asked if there is a distribution of condoms in its administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">'This is not how it works sexuality, the best is to provide of condoms to people already sexually', he pointed out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The figures to Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 case cumulative (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state is the fourth state of the country number of new cases and cumulative case of AIDS and 13th for the number of those infected with HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of contamination are promiscuous, 6% through the blood and 2% by road perinatal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judgment ratified by a court of appeal US ignores the debt restructuring of the group vitro granted via a bankruptcy trade in Mexico. The scenario is a dangerous precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that the procedures for survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the star-spangled banner, opposite view of international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">A practical point of view, the blow to the judgment on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of bankruptcy for the district north of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless against the possibility of embargo their properties beyond the Great.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution will allow the largest manufacturer of glass of Mexico to take the US Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First, while the judge of the cause that creditors must register according to the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the fifth circuit, in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is bankruptcy commercial formalised in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, the law Modèle United Nations International Commercial uniformity of the law was created to this end in taking the American Law Institute as arbiter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the critical mass of bankruptcy, the commercial debts incurred by subsidiaries of fertilisation to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the Mexican laws recognise this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the case of fertilization is not the first to use this plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is a half-dozen of examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of bankruptcies Business had guarantees the debts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, all the ways the creditors of fertilisation who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds' vulture 'as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not obtained the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been to 45 votes against 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A given omitted by the Court of Appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, fertilisation has been blamed for the difficult situation that it was running since 2008 without stop to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, reflecting the costs to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For the moment, the society of the family González Sada interjettera appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The use of assurance will call for the non-prospérité and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The more serious is that the Court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ('friend of the Court') in which was the procedure followed by detailed vitro in the framework of the law on the bankruptcy, by saying that the town of conventions signed by both countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Moreover, that the country has bowed to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border cases of insolvency, which guarantee fairness to debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of history of the local Basketball Championship also that of Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The reason is that before a brain drain the condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, that this is as a player lower leagues, the national team player, basketball manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as President of the basketball federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">'I have been several hats in the Basketball Championship throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, Director-General of the national team and President of the Federation' during the 1990s, remembers Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where it lies with Isabel, its faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">'The Basketball Championship is all my life'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes am not exaggerating when he made this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of their homes, almost all décorés photographs and memories who recall its route out standards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the heart Bayamón</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all its memories, those that we love most are those who recall its passage as player within the team of Vaqueros in the middle of the 1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">'It has been my best years, those I have profited most because I had the opportunity to participate in the eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">For many years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From here, 'Cuco' Ortiz, which was a great administrator, has taken the lead of the team, 'says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I recall that Gene Bartow, which had been leader here and which was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a strapping player for you, it is two metres.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want it? '</seg>
<seg id="17">This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow am next recommended Raymond gausse, which has been naturalised and which was a better marksmen.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon win a championship, gausse would help us to try to win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is pleased with the championship of Vaqueros gausse, but only to distance as in 1988 it was already the great manitou of the Federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time, it preferred to take advantage of its charges and those of Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we have won for the first time the United States at the tournament pré-olympique of Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Secondly, there was the 1990 World, where we have reached 4th and where we have had to win the bronze if the judge Canadian we did not play the final match, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is part of the best, like that which has fought the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favourite Panaméricains Games is that of Cuba in 1991, when we have won the gold and that we have put a kicking to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team was not only comprising Mincy, gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), there was also young people (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was unable to attend the world from 90 to cause a problem of its knees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pré-olympique of Neuquén in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players as' Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the mess in the Games Panaméricains Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without taking account of its trajectory in the various leagues for which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">That has been the best leader portoricain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the young, I very much like the work that fact Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">For you, what is your greatest success in the Federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Have been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had until 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">You have to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalisation of minor categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that boys of Pontius play only in their area and are only teams of other parts of the island in the national play-offs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, young people are travelling and play too when it is not strictly necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I have at least given the benefit of compulsory and qualifications for the leaders, the staff of ground and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">This makes me happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I see Basketball Championship matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been my side.</seg>

<seg id="1">A course on the 'Ending world' has just begun</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, the students investigate issues as the apocalyptic nuclear war, the zombis, the virus and the seeds and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This six-month period, when Professor of religion Stuart charmé has decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew he was casting a bait irresistible: the end of the 'great' Mayan count the timetable, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Professor charmé had no idea what the expected in the months following: Hurricane Sandy, a disastrous fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the 'own Armageddon debt' and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the theorists Christians in the end of time believed that whichever Apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">'I am not realised that this would be half the more apocalyptic that I have never experienced', said this week Professor charmé its students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we racontions, it has been a very good time.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the only Professor to give lessons on 'the end of the world' this six-month period, which will, in theory, the last of history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To Temple, Professor deputy Barry Vacker exemption the 'Médias, culture and end of the world'.</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, the students investigate issues as the apocalyptic nuclear war, the zombis, the virus and the seeds and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">'We are analysing this because these ideas are proliferating with the time,' he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide a certain human conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students analyse films with apocalyptic issues and look at how they can be compared with examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'I have tried to inform my students on what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,' said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On campus main of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a deputy chief history of the Art and anthropological, have to give a course, simply entitled 'The end of the world'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'We add' 2012 'for the possibility of giving the way to new, in cases where the world would disappear not ", declared Professor Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the imminent 'disaster', students to study, create projects and spend their final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which should not leave the student choice but to work 'until the night of the end of the world supposed ", declared Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Prices were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">'It has been complete in two hours', said Restall about its intended for students, composed of 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the term, the people who were there were still room.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, for their part, ensure that is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">'This fascinates me to see what people are able to take comfort "says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion, and sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, the University of Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether religious or secular, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">'I had never heard of a way which taught this matter,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I appreciate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students, and still less a professor said, we believe in the end of the world of 21 December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">'Our first draft was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited', says Julie zegle, student of last year to Temple of 21 years and from West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But I admit that there is anxiety linked to the Armageddon in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused an increase in those speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'In other parts of the world, people do not believe in this', ensuring.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is in the majority of the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University The Salle which gives in the Philippines this year, has responded quickly when asked whether he knew that we gave here on 'the end of the world'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">'The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world', nous-a-t-il responded, as if it was an exception from a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a result of the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall pointed out that over the years, we spoke of the many dates supposed of reckoning, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, 'people will begin immediately to look at the next date' or to philosophise about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of the world will disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers are the date lightly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several we have said that they believed in to the parties' the end of the world '.</seg>
