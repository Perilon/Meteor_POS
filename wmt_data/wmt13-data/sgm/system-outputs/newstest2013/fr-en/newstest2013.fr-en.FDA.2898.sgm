<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter the d' Obama reelection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders condoned their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Centre as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United-States that the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">D' elsewhere, lawyers Republicans n' identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud to United States-in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect adversely the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for l' federal elections Member-States.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this spirit C' qu' a majority of US governments passed from 2009 new legislation making it more difficult the process d' registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has taken l' scale after elections in November 2010, which saw s' add 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accordingly, 180 projects of laws restricting l' exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the 2011 alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require voters to cast a card d' photo ID and proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws also reduce periods of advance polls, invalidate the right to s' register as a voter on polling day and remove the citizens with a criminal file their right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no State voters n' required to submit a photo identification card d'.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana L' was the first State to ask such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008-upheld the constitutionality of the law of l' Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The authorities by republican s' d' extend this practice d' other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo identification card d'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity card d' as the l' health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, lack of cards d' photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a d' d' identity.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, it is often more than one hundred dollars to obtain the identity card d' required.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low income persons.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of afro-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over the age of 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not possess the required d' identity card with photo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Much more.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students, considered more voters voted for other democratic candidates are not permitted in several States to use their card d' photo ID issued by their institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, these same States permit members clubs fishing or hunting who vote more on the Republican side d' use for voting cards issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no State n' required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona L' was the first to make such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen d' states have enacted laws requiring electors to prove qu' they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it appears that two Hispanic voters on three promote the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing l' registration of voters on polling day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors seeking s' register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not inconsequential.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, when l' 2004 general election campaigns d' voter registration helped save approximately 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the rate of 17% d' registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the period of polls.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, when l' 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were afro-Americans, while they accounted for only 13% of the voters of l' State.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the same with Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Ceux-ci accounted for 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In return, the whites who were 76% of voters accounted for 46% of electors voting in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters objected vigorously to l' adoption of laws restricting l' voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">L' Advocate General of United States-intervened to suspend the laws the most controversial.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 States have enacted laws requiring the submission d' d' identity card with photo.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules implemented will undoubtedly make it more difficult l' exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics Democrats denounce the partisan nature of laws that have been enacted and they see a clear objective d' influence the results in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report by the Brennan Centre 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 election.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: These new provisions will affect adversely the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening: Pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test d' would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, causing unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked l' Notice of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies conducted in the United-States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult d' interpret these data and d' have firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, the then-European concluded a difference of mortality among patients who had a screening n' and those who have not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed, with a followed after 12 years, was qu' between 30 and 40% more likely d' have metastasis n' if it is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men d' afro American-origin are also at greater risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make the right decision once qu' detected cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other d' are feeble.</seg>
<seg id="13">We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of the cancer, by offering options, by not addressing necessarily prostate cancer who do not affect life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases ,-for active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many d' Aujourd' men showing cancer will not be processed, because their cancer n' is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">We suggest to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, with accuracy criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I therefore recommend to pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But important d' l' is having a discussion with her physician to determine if you should spend or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In collaboration with the International Society d' urology, Movember has created a tool that allows d' evaluating the pros and cons of d' PSA test.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He n' unfortunately no easy way to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of research, l' adoption of lifestyle remains the best way to reduce risks d' suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody smokes, this rate was at least 50%," says Andr√© Beaulieu, door-word of the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, assessing qu' approximately 10% of cancers are caused by l' inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several also remain totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cigarette is linked to 85% of all cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was detrimental to the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Still aujourd' today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", deplores the door-floor Andr√© Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging l': 10 years after quitting, your risk of dying cancer d' fall by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Overweight and obesity l' L' also promote l' onset of illness, according to the CSC.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, l' oesophagus, pancreas and l' uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity l' during a lifetime protects against colon cancer," adds-Engine and thus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">L' diet</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">L' organization also recommends to reduce consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">Too much of it raised the risk d' be achieved d' colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Meats, and should be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can damage cells of l' organization and lead to the development of cancer," explains-Engine and thus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their research, however, are not conclusive for l' moment.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While a l' d' they noted a reduction in risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">L' effect of vitamin D on cancer n' is unclear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed l' importance to discuss her concerns and his family history with their physician.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Being tested, it does not cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson scrutinized</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Probable L' announced the discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, l' last summer, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of anything in l' universe, no less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then there are the last s' l' particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "bad" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the material - but n' has still not been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists, he is n' all√© qu' whether he s' the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a doubt that shadow l' d' l' taking genuine new particle, and qu' it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new findings this week at a major conference d' physics, Kyoto, seem to confirm, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Suppose all the same it s' qu' whether the Higgs, since the chances seem to be thin, and see what it is s'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world, a law inevitably unavoidable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">No way d' violating this rule - and n' not try too hard, you will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, even if particle physics is a strange world, it is s' qu' she, too, a law like this: The Pauli exclusion principle d', which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">From there, physicists rank particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, whom wisely the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in another l' s' wag bosons, a dirty Gaza d' n' anarchists who have respect for nothing ‚Äî at least, not for this principle, which means qu' they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, d' elsewhere) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: The mesons, which we n' will not here, and the particles "force", by which the major forces of nature spread and that the Higgs boson is somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons-there, it should be emphasised here are not all bugs also exotic qu' you might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you read this column, c' is through a boson d' an extraordinary banality: The photon, or "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes of direction, this "disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this exact spot, a bit like a stone thrown in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "disturbance" born an electromagnetic wave (light, or l' or l' infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this is another wave n' d' qu' a photon - and therefore, a boson "bearers of strength."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Field more stable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies with the Higgs boson, with the difference that c' is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for l' excite, we must achieve very, very high energies, a bit like s' s' d' it was a frozen pond which only a very large rock could ride the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">C' must therefore be a huge particle accelerator - such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27km circumference! - to achieve such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">L' analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">These are not all particles, or all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do, but other d' not - a piece of paper, for example, will never him-even on a fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, these are not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while others (like the photon) n' have not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, qu' is-what "can provide" all this research, asked Ms. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and this also allows physicians to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and MS predictions.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also d' several who earnestly hoped qu' found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a new "physical" some holes and cap the Model.</seg>
<seg id="31">Celui-ci, it must be said, still has huge d' shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which trains about 80% of the Universe l' (re-oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But it has not found n' such deviations at CERN jusqu' to now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The implications of this research in the everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume he qu' n' will not.</seg>
<seg id="35">Note: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, unaware of the revolution that their work would trigger.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but the rest.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, we have already said fire physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and was well-developed the first laser (the first), pulsed in 1962 - initially the laser was viewed as a "gadget lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And then applications can also come from any l' instrumentation surrounding research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, during its work in optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This detector, although this n' was not at all its original intent, Now '"eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and won the 2009 Nobel physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative Care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With his Commission die with dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must resume shortly so qu' a bill prepares.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir tried d' closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in her apartment in the Mont√©r√©gie region.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer who gnawed left him with a break of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They m' gave five years to live, j' have seven years," said-it-figue, half-grape, lying in bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it happened the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But c' is still a shock, we cannot be prepared for it," said-it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is his work: A weakness which prevents l' to travel to the washroom, and even eating alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attabl√© before a delicious lunch, he will be helping to eat, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageous, they sometimes smile, talk to strangers are s' around him, brought him his medication, offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage to death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest hope, is c' qu' I heal diarrhea, c' is demeaning," says-.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the "team has found a cure for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"During our lives, you learn qu' a man, piss standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Decline in l' child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept regression-notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because l' Notice of several people involved in palliative care, moments take place at the heart of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a life expectancy of up to three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses d' around them does not provide more care expressed" therapeutic ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease m' did discover my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"J' have good-children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have more n' wishes in life," said-she before d' accept qu' he is a mask for l' help breathing.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is still, in the coming days, a last visit of his son come d' Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Victor-Gadbois, scene, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps l' l' diet.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the palliative care, given that l' when he n' d' has nothing else to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">C' is little known qu' when they are all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, a l' doctors of the house.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether in the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The dying, it will provide care to mouth the brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, c' is his son to complete the beer at the foot of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It helps families as patients," said Nathalie Savard, Director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Home Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not look alike.</seg>
<seg id="42">Alongside a d' 93 years old man who savours his last family assembly in the yard, well cushioned in pillows and qu' it is falling in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything possible to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients aged under 45 years s' concerned," Dr. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47 per cent of l' hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem d' access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians n' simply have no access to palliative care, including c' is-care designed to alleviate the suffering lorsqu' a patient reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, l' hospital or in home care.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several agencies, as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">C' is precisely this great gap in health care in Quebec has several doctors specializing in palliative care l' adoption d' legislation governing l' euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October d', a manifesto, signed luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system n' is not good enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before l' accepted to l' euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, said-she, j' saw a patient spend 14 days l' emergency in great pain, without qu' we do the necessary to relieve.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients are dying because qu' they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, several oncologists s' jusqu' stalking their patients at the last day, despite the worst predictions.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of survival d' H√©l√®ne Richard were already minimal lorsqu' dropped chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When j' have told my oncologist that j' stopped treatment, she replied m' qu' she regretted that j' stop fight, she-said.</seg>
<seg id="56">Yet she m' had said that I was finished! "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Not all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who want to die thanked caregivers not acceding to their application after qu' they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But we must say that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors have often use palliative sedation, which amounts to lull the patient jusqu' at the time of his death, sporadically, permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend not to hear this part-the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the possibility to have this d' palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I want you m' euthanasiiez" means "I want to be relieved."</seg>

<seg id="1">Real estate scandals in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Officials from roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian Mafia tell day after day this qu' they know d' a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.</seg>
<seg id="3">A "industry" who dearly to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"C' is curious as the system s' eroded since qu' we took major," good Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and the former chief of police of Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">C' is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through d' an investigation on malpractice related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which Liberal Premier Jean Charest, time l' n' had consented qu' backwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, financial underpinnings of parties and corruption of public officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of l' investigation in 2010, stresses-advantage, the only department of transport would be spared a billion in contracts, some" being their instincts to reach a quote-part!</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "has already brought down two mayors," adds-it, hoping she qu' to demonstrate "schemes behind individuals."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A permanent unit against corruption, established in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Permanent Unit L' corruption, created in 2011, s' addressed with his army of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police squad l' "Twilight" which, since 2009, led the cartel "sewer" from Montreal to apply the brake on the swelling contracts...</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent weeks, she conducted searches in series and laid charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor d' a suburb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who comes to resign from his position of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected d' have pocketed pots-of-wine repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Are formally charged furthermore engineers roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs d' Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter was feeling explaining to the Committee the mechanics of "system" d' win public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He even paid-for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded to Montr√©al to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait l' money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor G√©rald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He confessed also have organized a collection of illegal funds for l' ex-vice-premier, Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Contracts d' sewers that inflated costs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption functioned smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, ex-public works engineer, l' has detailed before the committee: In 10 years, he received d' construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and pots-of-wine totalling $736,000 in exchange for contracts d' sewers that inflated costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other D' road officials said s' be done smear by 30% to 40% invoices, by false extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay d' deliberately ignored a budget parallel fuelling its coffers with l' dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montr√©al in a major crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal l' Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm d'.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mayor of l' district of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, l' is l' island s' from 2010, she rebelled against the sale d' municipal property purchased 5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers, booming real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% d' dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Investigation of l' will finally be put in place, she said she "qu' draws on a wire to understand how the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and apprehend culprits".</seg>
<seg id="30">The process, said-she is painful but "positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">One is to clean the wound but a unit d' investigation in Montreal and a watch, not to see back questionable practices.</seg>
<seg id="32">As they cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau noted that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but s' mainly concerned the role of '"elected aware of the scheme", when they do not soaking in the politicking!</seg>
<seg id="35">Considering to 70 per cent d' dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "We m' said it was n' qu' a pale reflection of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations but this will not change the situation, he said: "Both qu' will not strictly election expenses, there will be l' dirty money in politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">It calls for an overhaul of the system d' granting of public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go below; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story tarnishes l' international image du Qu√©bec and Montr√©al, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh watching in their own backyard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not n' FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season, you took a new scale with the GMP.</seg>
<seg id="3">How you explain-this progression?</seg>
<seg id="4">You can explain l' awareness but also by the new dimension of the GMP.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I continue to their side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff m' has also contributed.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a daily basis, these factors lead me to raise my level.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in game, c' is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not ignited m'.</seg>
<seg id="12">My debut at the centre of preformation of l' INF Clairefontaine during my visit to Saint-Etienne, j' have always put forward by levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You are therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Recruits this summer are used to play games of very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that each training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">What makes qu' a player like me wants to cope and to provide the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti m' brings a lot about my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is-he l' man of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti gain respect from all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">It Aujourd' n' d' has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience and won many titles with upscale clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he qu' wins d' other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, comforting j' had a discussion with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I left then d' a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Confidence he qu' m' gives also explains my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How do you wear-on the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In Ligue 1, Lyon we took the place of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our key objectives is the Champions League: We have qualified for the semifinals with the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is l' objective of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try d' go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we will have our say in very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want our first d' finish first, before Porto, to receive in the web.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG-it can become a great European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">It has already the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and s' register in duration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aujourd' n', this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, PSG has the means to make this happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, it was really heart d' pocket this championship.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season, n' is not far away.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It has been a very large season.</seg>
<seg id="49">It ended with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champion...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, conducted a season more fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think c' is good.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think qu' l' was arms to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you-media expect too much of the MTP?</seg>
<seg id="55">C' is normal qu' much awaited us in view of what has been invested and players are qu' a.</seg>
<seg id="56">We fully accept l'.</seg>
<seg id="57">After lorsqu' win 4-0 at home against Troyes and qu' there are still things wrong c' is sure c' is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people expect more.</seg>
<seg id="59">You can never win 4-0 all week-ends.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not n' FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to implement a project.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">It was demonstrated in Champions League qu' could be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City n' not happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the semifinals of the final, they have also made d' enormous expenses!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested, you guessed d' with 15 points ahead to the truce!</seg>
<seg id="66">C' was neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not n' well last season, were "boost√©s" by this new GMP.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">J' hope qu' in May we can have a smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we eventually l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much the better qu' characterization qu' there is a "Zlatan dependency."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means qu' Ibrahimovic is very efficient and qu' he puts a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to it and it proves qu' it is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has demonstrated wherever it is past qu' he was a great player, a star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the group, it respects l' man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the men he qu' around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">This qu' he is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">It encourages others to raise their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is l' one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you lived l'-Euro 2012 with l' team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">J' had committed to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented m' to glean game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">J' saw things l√†-bas and j' am strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">, Aujourd' j' arrives to achieve good games in selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">C' is what j' hoped since my baptism with the Blues.</seg>
<seg id="87">It has learnt from what s' rose in Ukraine and aujourd' d' must now be exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">How do you wear-on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of France?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has the results for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is well positioned in the group qualifier for the Mondial.</seg>
<seg id="91">Breeders is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires win.</seg>
<seg id="92">As l' was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to make comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">White had achieved his goal by calling us for l' Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">J' hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The good nil (1-1), 16 October, Spain is a founder-advantage?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each s' fought for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived n' match this in my career.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Quite the opposite of monetary exchange, based on central banks of the transactions identified and processing costs between stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a protocol d' secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows l' file exchange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Approximately 200,000 transactions have been recorded with 15 000 computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">A thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The price of bitcoin, after having reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning aujourd' d', around a dozen dollars (courses are registered on the site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing very impressive, compared to the real world trade in currency or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) s' is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">She describes bitcoin virtual currency as "the most successful," "in competition with the dollar or euro l'" and "similar to conventional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin stands out d' other types of virtual currency as the "credits", used for progress in a video game that l' in playing or l' you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But each time, a central authority and control trafficking trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bitcoin, with all the nodes of the network are both depositaries of the book, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses how d' an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except qu' a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring l' anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A whole d' information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of double encryption key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can check l' authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the s' bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of Public Accounts, distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">L' step-key is to write this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It passes through the resolution d' a mathematical challenge launched computers, and the winner, sort of central banker, will have the privilege d' add this line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase d' s' hash file is c' d' including-processing a large file in a shorter and unique fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" l' together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number who gives a particular stamp (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number found other knots check that c' is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of l' other transactions; any amendment would change l' imprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - l' other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">Computer L' resolved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid l' inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible jusqu' the 100 millionth, leaving the room...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the challenge is also found in each computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed in bitcoins deposits.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The flaw used does not concern the protocol-even him," says Pierre Noizat, who recently launched Paymium, a payment in real money using the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also identifies opportunities for money laundering d' through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash also has this defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">Serious players like Wikipedia denies donations of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Other D', such as flat-form of WordPress blog, acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, l' Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the book of accounts and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins not run.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, "giant" balances were launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul bitcoins, which converts the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Stone, Noizat author d' a book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payments, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The holder manages its identity and can be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement in merchants, who need n' d' install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It suffices to communicate an address qu' a phone can photograph "and", says Pierre Noizat having thousands d' users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to subvert the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take time for Bitcoin s' needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," predicted-it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB, in his report, provides d' elsewhere to reassess the casualty, aujourd' considered high, in case of success of this currency.</seg>

<seg id="4">L' NATO and Americans should follow end 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time that l' Afghan army regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any expect of us.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we, with our same-88 soldiers killed and wounded, the maimed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consist d' foreign extremists, former Heads d' refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign army, as the Soviet times.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend their traditions, old and outdated, even s' they were joined by jihadis, Pakistan, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local insurgents, ceux-ci will any more when Westerners will be more discreet.</seg>

<seg id="13">There will be no flood n' Taliban Kabul at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, the country aflame by struggles between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their takeover of the country was seen as a sort of liberation, a return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid the price of l' obscurantism of these farmers overwhelmed by l' organization d' Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved s' today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main leaders of the Soviet Army war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have calcified into business, taking up government land for resale in building land returnees d' Iran and Pakistan, with enormous "contracts under-American contracting.</seg>
<seg id="21">They challenged; most d' n' d' them have not fought them-same.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard l' in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not formed of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, leave those who took advantage of American largesse: Capital flight is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have worked with the modern world in their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years; Kabul are now d' 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In cities, government schools are full, girls as boys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will provide work for these young people to return to l' obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of rulers.</seg>

<seg id="33">L' Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the powerful local identities, should benefit from a d' decentralization, l' image of Western nations, but the United States-wanted to transform it into a centralised, strong presidency, abolishing the post of Prime Minister who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not controls foreigners, especially l' elections scheduled in April 2014.</seg>

<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing happened, except n' fruits and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">Priority is left to l' private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country devastated by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The noise was widespread as l' Afghanistan had d' vast mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">This n' made qu' add to the sense that Westerners n "s' were there for them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to treat iron ore or copper, or means of transport for l' export through the mountains, it was not n' d' mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) search l' Buddhist site and remain the largest employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day we will have to also that l' Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal reports.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A constitution in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">C' is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While l' Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him temporarily full powers, he decided to play her va-all.</seg>
<seg id="4">Taking the world by surprise, he announced Wednesday that l' Constituent Assembly vote its final text tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago, the head of l' State had granted two months to this House to finish its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Nearly two years ago that l' Egypt s' based on a provisional text several times amended which renders institutional stability and led to legal entanglements.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative n' made qu' increase the divide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents, President perseveres in its "autocratic delusions" and "betray his word" and "trampling the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the side of his supporters, it ensures that c' d' is a means to an end sooner rather than the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">A referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to renounce their project d' explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For President, c' is also a way of a popular and democratic legitimacy as the protests raged throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote favourably as l' said in an interview with l' weekly American Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">D' as this remedy to a vote is precipitated l' ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I keep full powers", ceux-ci before supposedly end after l' adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">C' is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, great Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals were l' appeal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Half-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, not having been able to communicate their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of Human Rights l', religious minorities or civil society had done the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, substitute members were added hastily, yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Unsurprisingly, c' is most often at l' unanimity that the items were approved.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators have also d' fun because qu' only differences of the day has spoken around... l' hour of prayer, some members of the Committee suggested that the pendulum was poorly resolved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was still in the process of "be voted yesterday evening, 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Objects of attention, l' Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of "Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace" principles "by" the rules ", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article n' has not been amended, was a sign of goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", the Liberals, who see n' qu' a communication.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because they l' Islamization of the Constitution is through d' other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They include l' article 220, which gives l' Al-Azhar university an advisory role, especially with regard to verify the conformity of laws with the sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the historian l' Egypt Sophie Pommier, c' is worrying because "people called pronounce are not elected and n' have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the beginnings d' a theocracy ".</seg>
<seg id="32">Fears liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate current l'.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For l' hour, he was not n' d' religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of State l'.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system "tempered Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledged "qu' there may be ambiguity around l' article 220, because the terms used borrow vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">It refers to "fiqh" Islamic jurisprudence, including [ed].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the issue could in future l' ask to what extent of civilian judges are competent to decide upon. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In-beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is much criticism of powers qu' it attaches to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood argue that those-marks are significantly reduced compared to this qu' under l' former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another issue: The powers conferred on l' army.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the wishes of military l' review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Council for defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nor are prohibited trials of civilians in military courts, as requested by the rights associations l' man.</seg>
<seg id="44">These are also share their concerns about the text, qu' they consider liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy is maintained and l' insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on d' expression, freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no article is more similar to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only consolation is l' prohibition of torture by l' article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not included in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While Egyptian President should express s' last night on television, demonstrations are planned this after-noon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The support of the head of State l' march them, Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"That was in Moscow:" Migrants save l' money to learn the language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While MEPs and human rights activists pol√©miquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and d' other Russian cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of the time, they are nationals of l' Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their sole purpose: Earn l' money to help their families back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the moment, this rule is that those who have l' intention to work in the services sector, housing, services to individuals and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of l' History of Russia and the foundations of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It will be necessary to validate his linguistic knowledge in Russian for and renew his work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exempt only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Persons who have received certificates or diplomas d' l' education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by this law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of centres d' review will be under auspices of l' l' Institute of Russian language Pushkin, l' University of l' friendship peoples l' d' State University, Moscow State University l' d' Saint-Petersburg and other d' d' higher education institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants can take examinations in all cities: More than 160 centres have been established throughout the territory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This initiative d' introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma d' and the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, before the law enters into force, the human rights defenders l' have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: Qu' is-ce que √ßa va?</seg>
<seg id="18">What is Qu'-l' obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First, any d' meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "l' slavery at work."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many speak in defence of the rights of migrant workers, the Chief of Staff of the Russian Federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of rights must begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a selection system organized will resolve to 90% the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and n' have no medical certificates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of l' help, will provide a "trip" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of others is tourmenteront for months without food and paperless and must work between 12 and 14 hours per day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Home, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, it is their passport, and they do not affect the expected wage," confirms the Chief Executive Officer of migration services for the work of the migration service Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don ‚Äô t argue, the policeman!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, many citizens of Central Asian republics d' coming to earn money l' Russia entrust qu' they are not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also qu' they write with difficulty in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="29">This n' is, of course, not their fault, but their misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow ne serait-ce qu' fair primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Indeed, their families n' not even have to feed their children not to mention the properly dressed and equipped to l' school.</seg>
<seg id="31">When they arrive at l' qu' teenager, these young people earn l' money as soon as l' opportunity arises.</seg>
<seg id="32">C' is difficult when you are not familiar with the language, they entrust-.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel diminished and reduced".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Advocates of Human Rights l' notice however an important aspect of the Law on the language.</seg>
<seg id="35">The reviews are intended solely for migrants who have a legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">Without status, he n' will not review or d' official workplace thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome or defence d' enter"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many immigrants d' qu' n' explain it is not so easy d' obtain an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, legalization costs l' money: Between 12 and 16 miles roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And then you can obtain a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Russian police know that we have forged documents, we have not n' d' registration, where d' cases d' extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what s' buy cigarettes, tea," said journalists Umed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Am quickly, without skimping-and buys you a beautiful work d' art"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">From the first day of l' entry into force of the Act on the language, it was discovered that the papers d' n' registration of migrants were not the only ones to be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several false certificates d' reviews of languages have been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="48">Falsified papers out d' colour printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to facilitate examinations spent seven thousand rubles for this document.</seg>
<seg id="50">C' is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: Below-cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Representatives of power and defenders of Human Rights l' s' agreed that l' short- term objective is to protect the system against corruption to qu' it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."</seg>
<seg id="52">Authorities may give to migrant workers who have n' could not validate l' review of the first time to attend courses of language.</seg>
<seg id="53">Furthermore, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that involve n' not actively communicate with people.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and l' Rosstat, the criminal records and public data portals for weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explained, has just l' l' and military forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of weapons on the black market s' is found "for lack of employees whose work is linked to the weapons," explains-Engine and thus in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of firearms were places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "excavations."</seg>

<seg id="1">United States-: Employees of fast-Foods and supermarkets are on strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost a quarter d' American teenagers spend by a cashier in McDonald' if</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald', Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy' and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will take l' scale or s' lost rapidly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These actions are supported by unions and a number of associations d' left.</seg>
<seg id="6">Parallel to increase l' modest wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, events organizers want the establishment of unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This sector is for n' l' moment not covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a flood of rain balances s' grabbed million inhabitants s' d' hit l' America and triggering sometimes outbursts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Ce jour-l√†, some employees of society Walmart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people left their position to organize picket lines with unions and activists left stores company whose products are destined to consumers and small classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything: The hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">C' is why many workers poorly paid at Walmart shop solely on their workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The price and the choice of products made of Walmart l' one of the groups most powerful Member-States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products including because of low wages of its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or laptop scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants demonstrations of "Black Friday" called for a salary increase, they complained that the price of l' medical insurance provided by l' company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the employee base at Walmart affecting 9.5 $l' hour c' is a sum qu' he cannot afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from l' Californian University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 hour l', it would be the group 3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">C' is 1.1% over this qu' it currently spends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart l' transferred any increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store their would 46 cents.</seg>
<seg id="22">They spend in only one year 12.39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine States and n' brought no prejudice to the group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 08: 00 to midnight the next day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its caisses have conducted a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The door-floor of society Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the site of Huffington Post qu' left in any "less than five employees" Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a "n' qu' operation among many other d' com '" from the union organizer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Customer!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this city, they are not very appreciated c' n' is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald' and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald' s announcement selling billion portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage by federal legislation and that of New York is $7.25 l' hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fast-Foods the increases with time, but few employees, on average basic affect New York $8.90 l' hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody touch less qu' them in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For me c' is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost one quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald' seconds after the school while living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Aujourd' today, I find myself to interview McDonald' employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other D' on the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found comments saying qu' it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near the McDonald' o the 40th Street and Madison Avenue required cashiers and cooks of the fast-food are paid at least $15 l' hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also requested that establishment of unions in the fast food sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prohibits l' administration d' hinder and punish protesters d' a union by bullying or dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, their administration l' simplifies rarely life.</seg>
<seg id="43">For the union, s' take fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">A major L' is extraordinary l' turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They are not d' agreement</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">D' tumultuous manifestations stood near several other d' fast food chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the day near McDonald' of Times Square with l' intervention of several local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, said: "If McDonald' announcement selling billion portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly!".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by new-Yorkais d' other Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio said that "we must all support employees of fast food for qu' they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New-Yorkais.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The New York Times has characterized this event as the largest qu' the fast food sector throughout its history.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people attended that all n' were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">L' moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"At the moment, we sometimes n' moderately to trick the brain"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Recently, fans of new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Initially, c' is Google unveiled this summer his current model at its annual conference and in November, it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, according to l' interview with the director of 3D technologies interactive Microsoft Laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, as scientists this society, the glasses are already l' ancient history.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating objects in virtual l' air with bare hands, by creating d' virtual spaces open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Could you tell us --briefly what your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are working on l' l' interaction between man and machine and we are at the same time d' expand the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">L' humanity as a whole has remained at the moment the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes touch.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and the radical changes that occur with this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox Kinect and sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is now sells aujourd' without Kinect because everyone s' interested in the order by the gesture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What we reserve l' future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although the Kinect rendered l' physical interaction, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The seizure of l' information was improved (the system receives more data), but the performance for l' moment, not really.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that, and we are working on d' truly 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must break the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.</seg>
<seg id="16">For that, however, we need to identify not only l' user, but also l' space that surrounds l'.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, we-d√©barrassons the silly virtual reality helmets!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What you think-commands?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is appreciated, but n' is-it not overstated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">We cannot say that it is the panacea: The issue of confidentiality arises because it qu' n' has not always want d' inform others of his actions or of his intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, each type d' interaction with l' computer is good, but everyone in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, no large gestures, but rather to discrete gestures, limited.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures n' were not captured by the camera l' device but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Currently he is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to size d' a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint, for example: Gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- C' is to say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how demanderiez-me you can spend this?</seg>
<seg id="29">You would with the words and gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- D' habit, I only speak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So, do you want to force users to adjust s' depending on what the machine may not be at one point?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it is s' d' rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think very soon we will have to work to l' development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of l' man.</seg>
<seg id="35">It can s' example laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolutions in depth and c' is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you s' interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensor, qu' is what-you not like n' in modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">They lack of resolution, depth or d' something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, c' is on the generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">It would, of course, be d' about 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 c / s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the problem n' them-camera is not the same, but the quality of the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">Compared to the last point, all existing technologies are good enough, it adds Labour designers d' algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">It should be borne in mind l' resolution X and Y and Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Speed is also much, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 (c / o do not, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave touch sensors regular delay treatment between 1 and 100 ¬µs, current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Everybody does not understand how this affects l' interaction of l' man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">J' d' would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- But do-it must not increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The aujourd' Kinect has three cameras "l'", which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is in fact a usual field sensor.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to define the depth of l' object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Many cameras could solve this problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse l' by increasing the volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, n' has not presented his glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that a d'-view of everyday use l' technologies, augmented reality glasses are a l' platforms with the more prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Certainly, walking all the time with a smartphone hands n' is impractical but behold what I think: The best option would be a transitory "augmented reality" that you would from d' a cloud platform of glasses in the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses are a very personal and c' makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: Augmented reality from glasses not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with d' others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of objects in virtual holographic l' air is more accessible qu' Tony Stark in Iron Man but also the mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem on which opponents at this point the finger n': There is no tactile sensation!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands feel nothings!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepares-advantage compared to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in l' l' interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth may very well be l' addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the moment, l' techniques is an interesting l' use of second hand for support d' image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It automatically records the pressures!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also some technologies that are really intended to assign the such to these "images in l' air": E.g. interference l' rays ultrasound directed to a point where the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, d' a breath d' air on the fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets worn on the wrist that affect nerve endings fingers, they are also an axis of work opportunities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- And you tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him believe qu' he feels this qu' it should feel when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, we n' have not yet tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is still a here-below on which it will take long the evil: How to suggest a quelqu' who is physically located in a very small space qu' it works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmill (nothing to do with those found in qu' fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">For the moment, it sometimes n' moderately to trick the brain, there are still many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes the work on virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: Many things are still l' absolute state of fertilization.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg puisqu' it was ripe for this difficult role in its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohemian.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> - J' have chosen red as designer specializes in appearance and l' l' image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator d' image and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although in society, everything that is not n' grey raises l' aggressiveness and unrest negative.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> - At l' exhibition Palace of Culture Nevskiy with my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">J' have understood that c' was my path.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then, the wave of older painters unofficial fell and the new, free, in my type, were misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">J' started me lier d' friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then n' had more vague.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">We started to s' interested in issues of reproduction in space l' focusing on flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is still a half-century, we conducted experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown on orbit were in no way of varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then, it was put into orbit insects, small flies flies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent in l' space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It gets to the exit a chick completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">C' is then that the problems start.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is related to the fact that the Chicks must find a support he must be put on his legs and start moving," explains the Laboratory Director of Institute l' problems M√©dico-biological l' Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Find no support, chicks waved s' disorderly.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 a.m., newborns saw their instincts entirely s' wither.</seg>

<seg id="30">After l' landing, rats of space l' gave birth to their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly into l' space.</seg>
<seg id="32">This n' is not an easy task.</seg>

<seg id="34">Unlike cattle, l' man is able, in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">L' Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional.</seg>
<seg id="36">This type d' n' experience is not made for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women go in l' space for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And l' female body is what l' humanity has more valuable.</seg>

<seg id="42">"No response to this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadz√©, Retired sector l' rockets and space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just a year after his flight in l' space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of l' child, Andrian Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and have worked in extra-environment is axiomatic, gave birth to a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk continues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have little, very little cosmonauts who were n' and give birth to a healthy after long flights.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And they s' are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of l' Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.</seg>

<seg id="55">Insofar as the baby is approximately 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb, it is easier to s' used to l' water.</seg>
<seg id="56">C' is logical, because since its birth jusqu' in the bath, it happens only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"C' is very little to forget," explains l' swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.</seg>

<seg id="66">It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.</seg>

<seg id="1">The ISC l' (Supreme Audit Institution) said: "The control pseudo independent work (in Czech)" system "≈†varc failed because politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of procurement, the Czech Republic has d' inspectors and d' good legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This C' qu' said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of l' Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, c' is what is lacking among us," said Kila in his commentary on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Control inspectors conducted jointly by Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He cited as an example of abusive practice l' approach to the "system" ≈†varc by Petr Neƒças.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS 'n' would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls; is-this therefore permitted or prohibited?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be applied d' d' one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent d' act a d' authority to inspect d' demand respect for the law," says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tch√©co German-in which were compared legislation on public contracts of these two countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was-it matter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is s' d' parallel control that we launched about two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">In simple terms, European legislation stipulates how manage public procurement and specific national legislation and practice qu' proper follow him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We collected all this and that this control is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: Generally speaking, our legislation may be "-tougher and better ", however, some parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms qu' it is not enough to continually elaborate rules increasingly detailed but qu' it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How will this project can help you-and-qu' results in negotiations for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A common control of this type should contribute to what we stopped strive to clarify the laws, to decline and improve d' thresholds, when this n' was not a really positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The principle of good governance means the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) to exclude d' enrichment and a possible criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the contracting thresholds are not necessarily n' will reach this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that this system is so swamped by paperwork, that those seeking loopholes will find much more d' opportunities if the threshold remained above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of legislation on public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">-advantage is an institution similar to our ISC or a different organization d' mode?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In terms of institutions, similarly to ISC l' works l√†-bas Bundesrechnungshof is similarly, it also has a d' council slightly differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: L' Germany is a federal structure, it has therefore also auditors of this kind at the level of the L√§nder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Bank can only control l' federal money, which is home to the resources of l' State.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds managed with the regions and municipalities, are low-controlled at the level of the auditors of the L√§nder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As regards national legislation, is-it simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I do not want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, l' Germany is often referred to as a model but it can scarcely be said she qu' do better in all areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">C' may be due to the fact qu' they have better inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it must be said that this country that we consider a model is also facing a series of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they n' no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards national legislation, qu' meant for you, as an institution, qu' l' amendment to the law on public procurement, its effects are already-they?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet n' d' impact on our operations control.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we ex post controls, he takes with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Our observations include, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument to detect "risks of mismanagement" with which we have scrutinized nearly 14,000 procurement - those changes would, of course, because the thresholds were modified so that the conditions of certain types of procedures d' calls d' offers and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Is-what so you consider l' adoption of this Act rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for l' administration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this constitutes a step in the right direction and j' hope future l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that these rules will become tougher and qu' it is not possible to observe them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) compelled controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is-he really useful to make the law more severe in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">No, not this way, I think.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without effect on the decisionmaking process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will put pressure on advantage d' l' administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So what is the solution for s' out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Look at where we n' will not.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister stated that l' ODS n' would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of self-saying ≈†varc qu'-system - is what this means?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system is ≈†varc-it prohibited or authorized?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be applied d' d' one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent d' act a d' authority to inspect and d' demand respect for the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It may declare: "We will change the law and allow l'", but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was n'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities, precisely in order to protect l' appeal d' offers.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is also a tragic qu' bidder be removed only for formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and c' is, in my opinion, what is lacking among us.</seg>

<seg id="1">≈†imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect l' positive energy."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">That think-you the fact that at least one month d' this should be the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those qu' n' alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love.</seg>
<seg id="4">In our group The Tap Tap, rigole rather and it is said that we are the only group able to collect a rest d' positive energy in order to delay or prevent d' the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In addition, you get in December a totally unique: Three concerts at the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can-you provide further details on this project to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">C' is a charity that we prepare for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided d' use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 hours 10am.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">They completed almost the culmination of the Maya calendar on l' island of Kiribati in l' Pacific Ocean, on a timezone ahead of 12 hours compared to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who was this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially I think c' was my idea, then we all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides the fact that we want to collect enough d' positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, consider l' state of the world that we leave to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">To l' opportunity to the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection d' unique objects, including T-, shoes, bags, and original keys on the end of the world, buying online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap with d' other interpreters has also recorded a hymn to the end of the world who s' entitled "cancelled" End of the world (in Czech "Konec svƒõta zru≈°eno").</seg>
<seg id="16">It is already very popular on YouTube, hears l'-Engine and thus also in these concerts charities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not n'...</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be sung by all the interpreters in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hymns will join also at some point in the framework d' a live show, unique, Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The lyrics of the song was written by Tom√°≈° Han√°k who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sang also...</seg>
<seg id="21">How are-you come to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We collaborate with other personalities d' show-biz Czech, due to the fact that we organise concerts and charitable events...</seg>
<seg id="23">We strive to make them participate intensively to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is clear that most s' d' them are interested in such cooperation and fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the benefits of these concerts on the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible for disabled people and we are working on the realization in the institute l' Jedliƒçka association with l' Tap, and for six years.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly visit students institute l' Jedliƒçk≈Øv activities for fun and interest.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students them-same n' not have the means to go to courses, we try to assist them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework of l' completion of l' Jedliƒçka institute, we will transfer this project in a new building independent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Several groups of music and interpreters will perform on stage in each of these concerts?</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria, avez-vous les chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried d' develop a program that s' address all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, will perform on Chinaski, Support their country, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω.</seg>
<seg id="34">You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Prepare-you also d' other "mega events" of this kind in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here too, we prepare a program with guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to play l' next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United-States, j' would combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your international projects are minimalistic jusqu' here you played by example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How you manage-l' organization and the logistics of your tour?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This n' is not so terrible that it has l' air at first.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members whose electric wheelchair devices must travel in the hold, of course we trimbalons also much baggage and boxes d' instruments....</seg>
<seg id="43">S' Jusqu' here is more or less well, CSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they have surprised m' d' once more.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, d' where we returned recently, all s' passed without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to your travel to foreign l', you can compare what these countries differ in terms of d' access facilities for the disabled, l' l' public attitude towards people with disabilities and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What were your experiences jusqu' far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and d' other places where everything works better than we have just witnessed in Moscow to qu' l' all n' is still in the initial phase.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; l√†-bas, it is not yet common n' qu' a person uses only in electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">They do not yet as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, low-, an association s' d' l' trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is currently d' be established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">What must-we still catching up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are lots of things for which we are still late...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is important to mention that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a handicap move alone in public spaces; they can go to the bathroom, the museum, n'...</seg>
<seg id="55">This n' is still not very common l√†-bas qu' a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary to the edge!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public and facilities d' access are one thing, but the situation begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="57">For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong willingness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years-qu' is what led in 1998 to create this group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">J' started work as an educator qu' l' Jedliƒçka institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in s' something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And as I-even musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.</seg>
<seg id="61">And then, over time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, it was a bit lost control of the situation (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The success came n' qu' in recent years, if I am not mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">C' is true, to build relationships with known singers and work actively to promote the group has helped.</seg>
<seg id="64">We understand that, if a work n' is not visible, it is like c' s' n' not exist at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="65">Subsidies of l' European Union, we can, we allow d' have faculty of quality, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Had you-objective d' reach this level with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, j' qu' have felt there was a potential for change things.</seg>
<seg id="68">Show business is full of tips that will copy each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">D' a way, c' is logical: Everything is new is accepted with caution and it lasts longer.</seg>
<seg id="70">Rare are the original projects, and j' dare say that Tap Tap is a l' d' between them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression d' someone who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, c' is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But pity is totally pointless, because people with disabilities are not people suffering, abandoned, that we must take pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a life and s' flourish, provided d' have the necessary means of course.</seg>
<seg id="74">I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something n', this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Is-what your success is not n' also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the work of quality, we must be intransigent in many areas and require discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think c' is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people arrive at us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize they must come qu' rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they rapidly lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieving goals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">'How many of them were already here in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">One, L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç.</seg>
<seg id="83">Nous sommes un groupe opened, people come and go, n'.</seg>
<seg id="84">Our doors are always open for those who want to or wanted to join us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the case the day before the scheduled day of the end of the world on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 9 p.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">This action will take place in Prague in l' Incheba arena, Brno and Ostrava to Fl√©da at Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and d' other musicians in the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when sung the song of the group The Tap Tap "cancelled" End of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The purpose of the concert is to collect financial resources ($25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre located in Prague in l' Jedliƒçka institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The price d' a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, l' entry is free for children jusqu' at 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of l' European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, she is the second Member State of former East bloc l' l' (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland had begun a close collaboration with l' ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of projects of l' agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">The road to Poland to l' space has however began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War, Poles who worked on space flights; they do not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to mention the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld l' observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his book d' avant-guard entitled "Introduction to IAA l'."</seg>
<seg id="7">Developments in this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later ≈†ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski s' attracted to its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, ≈†ternfeld obtained in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to IAA l'."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a big propagator l' astronomy and IAA l'.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds d' articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote prolifically on this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a propagator of IAA l', his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given a l' craters of the Far Side of the Moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">From 1925 was built in Poland railway d' intended to be fitted with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is unfortunately neither l' author nor the details of this project.</seg>
<seg id="14">He n' is also not clear if the rocket was meant to propel or inhibit the speeder.</seg>
<seg id="15">The only known information on this are those of the railway press l' era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, l' Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was conducted by l' institute Kom√≥rka Tromp Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to records held that this research had reached the trials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, with l' arrival of German armies, research has stalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, plans a rocket d' photoelectric hunting, designed by l' Rohozi≈Ñski engineer, appeared in the press and l' next year was published l' book "- Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" d' an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">These two projects aiming at a military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all projects d' use of the rocketry were conducted by the Scientific Advisory Board ("provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated all work.</seg>
<seg id="23">This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After the war, d' other work on aviation l' were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time, it is question d' a society in the November issue of the journal 1954 Problem, in which are four more detailed articles on l' Aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In l' one of these articles written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to IAA l'</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of Space Research had l' future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the beginning of 1956 l', the Polish Astronautical Society (ATP) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and l' fall, PTA became a regular member.</seg>
<seg id="29">L' next year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He retained his position jusqu' to his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the ATP brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket RM (Meteorological Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">This rocket d' a range of 1800 metres had 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thereafter was built an improved version, RM-1A, and during summer of 1959, l' test rocket flight to two floors RM-2 were initiated in the desert of Bledov.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket had a length of 1.4m and weighed probably 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prototype following should have been able d' perform science - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of jusqu' to 14.5 km and serve to observe the winds aloft.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1963, all development work were halted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The Meteor-1 rocket development during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded first rockets type RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of l' space for scientific tools.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket Meteor-1A had d' space with a volume of 0.4 litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C 0.62 litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of all these types d' device was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period 1965 - 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in l' Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of delivering a payload of 10 kg at an altitude d' approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently were built versions (Meteor-and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also worth mentioning l' entry of Poland to the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and establishing a national committee d' COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in l' exploration on the Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim√≠r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut this program.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">L' repeal of the law on Public Utility d' n' is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on the work d' public utility.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision has raised in l' public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is no doubt interesting d' examine this issue d' a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Economic systems oriented toward liberalism, both in l' EU that in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic competition unregulated.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means that economic entities as well as national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of freedom of trade and traffic free (unlimited) of private capital with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The considerable differences in the price of work (wages) generate pressure on prices.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be put under this term the following meaning: A producer s' working by l' importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in "making it more expensive" the price of the competitor, to remove d' greater market share and d' increase its own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: Either transfer production to l' foreigner, or buy cheaply or disappear. The result is a unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other d' economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given that the private capital has no responsibility n' socially and thereby responsibility towards unemployment qu' it engenders social charges are necessarily l'.</seg>
<seg id="12">This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of Messrs. entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to offset the social and economic damage caused to l' whole society through the race for profits.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is such a known n' qu' it is not necessary to provide statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unscrupulous practices private capital in different economies create a situation in which the governments of the countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in the goal d' attract foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account l' social collapse.</seg>
<seg id="16">This occurs primarily in the amendments of existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">L' objective is to compel economically its own population to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This occurs d' by a system of economic constraints in case of unemployment in the long term and other d' by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result, growing poverty and deepening l' differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are for years of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are already by million of these people.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within the framework of l' increase the competitiveness of l' German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries l' State will be obliged to pay extra for qu' they reach the subsistence minimum.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The measures d' economy virtually all the southern Member States EU l', without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure d' catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate d' (as was the case in the 19th century), to languish with wages, on the fringes of society, in l' hope one day qu' private capital to invest in their country.</seg>
<seg id="25">He should ask the following question: D' where will this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">S' d' from other EU countries l', poverty will d' a country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, a Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction d' a European salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">This includes any l' Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the media, s' parfait, l' State cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that l' command economy led to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital defends hard l' idea that l' State cannot intervene in l' economy by regulatory interventions.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then you wonder whether private capital n' not influence and even aujourd' does not, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the same l' whole State.</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The evidence is there is a lobby qu' virtually all-powerful and present in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">This results in a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by granting d' l' mutual benefit, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such, qu' due to a lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate l' development of draft laws to firms d' lawyers closely linked to l' industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">The entire power is not of the people, as expressed in the Western constitutions, but powerful financial groups for their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that democracies geared toward liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire 'at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The' State had long been in decline and functions were assigned by violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Les coups de pots-of-wine, favors received illegally, and stones and swords were also used for these positions.</seg>
<seg id="39">The bottom-of-table and corruption were spreading without limits and the people went to the election with voices already sold "..." People honest does not sought to obtain functions, the result was once l' State was 8 months without Honorary ".... 'We actually to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and qu' to choose an energetic man"... It is true qu' Appianos l' Pompey had in mind, but c' is Caesar who turned irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In conclusion, as in l' antiquity, the society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for l' interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="41">In essence, private capital n' is more capable of understanding and to promote the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="42">Consequently, as aujourd' decadence, an unprecedented elites, without any effort to reform.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must therefore seek out the causes of l' emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In l' stands, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the current elites ignore completely l' possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, humanitarian crises and social aujourd' we are the witnesses as well as crimes against humanity l' as we know them by l' past and recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">L' repeal of the law on the work d' n' utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally qu' internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is indeed systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is to sociopolitical reforms that strengthen capital investments of l' State in l' economy, increase l' influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of l' State.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israel: Laboratory of chaos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Nothing will ever violence and can never says" Sting in the song Fragile whose towards the refrain is "n' not forget how much we are fragile."</seg>
<seg id="3">"If my sons did not want war, he n' would not," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, d' many reactions were high.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some take the party d' Israel, citing his right to defend itself l' and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, d' other support the Palestinians, citing Racism l' State d' Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="6">I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in its recurrent waves of killing; after all, the current inhabitants d' Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and n' have not experienced the commencement of violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to give readers a point located "behind the scenes" on those who are mainly continued tensions already since more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration of 1917) in a small piece of countries of the Middle-East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of these reflections s' based on historical facts available at l' study, other d' emerge from my own understanding of, or more exactly the group d' individuals, which is the main instigator of events of l' modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">L' L' history of humanity is primarily l' history d' a struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What n' is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or s' they owed their actions to the throne a quelqu' who ran their actions based d' goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and the resulting financial powers n' could not be done during d' one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among families with a huge wealth from the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of octopus (j' is uncertain whether these families still have a leader but I do not exclude l').</seg>
<seg id="14">Little is written on them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the 1990s 19th century, they have acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) to stop l' establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts they were mixed and who had always meant a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have interests in almost most major central banks in the world and preparing or carry out wars against the countries in which they have not yet n' such shareholdings (before l' l' invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after l' invasion of Iraq l' 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4-time, Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to Bank of America of Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, j' hear) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to emit l' clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when qu' he wanted to bring an action against the EDF for initiating the Great Depression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for power at the global level led in 1859 in 1871 to formulating a plan d' three world wars by Albert Pike, a blunt-mason initiated the 33rd degree, being the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war aims d' eliminate major state monarchies d' Europe, the second should abolish colonialism, especially in the UK, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion d' individuals (such a quantity d' slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (l' ecumenism n' being anything other than d' l' began d' such a solution) and, in the end, acquiring an absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the 'following chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF designed to prevent are not repeated crises such as those qu' they produced in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">After successfully trigger the First World War by l' assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the throne austro-Hungarian, they destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without justification (economic and military war n' was more necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of l' Austria-Hungary, the power d' Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">Easier for the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: They have a d', imposed on Germany l' enormous war reparations generating conditions d' radicalization of the impoverished masses (they can then place a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing to the culprits, offering simple solutions d') and, secondly, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including d' a strong German minority who should play the role (qu') was fifth column to put the hornets and trigger a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the late 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, including a l' branches d' aspira to create a Jewish State, preferably in the region of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour Declaration mentioned ci-dessus laid the groundwork d' mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist acts were committed by and other d'.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out; it is difficult d' determine whether Hitler has broken the chains in which international bankers l' had initially; or if everything qu' he was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Jews d' Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of a Jewish State d' l' acceptance by the international community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany l' were l' origin of the Second World War, the founding of l' State d' Israel has lit a fire d' can cause a third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers can trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time the Arab population or generally Muslim Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders d' Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-I call Mr Azzolini, where a wrong creates another wrong in a circle of violence and contains l' origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire d' acquire power on the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We must make the difference between ordinary citizens d' Israel and their leaders, because as we offer international bankers do people in elections that their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">Current Prime Minister L' d' Israel is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, to start a war with Iran, which could l' due to l' membership of this country to l' Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) s' extend to become a global conflict and, given that l' Iran controls the Hormuz Strait d' which handles 20% of all the world ‚Äô s oil (this corridor naval n' has a width than 2 miles) and create a destruction of l' global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What were the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and the people to accept a new world order."</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call in Hollywood.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators consisting d' students took d' l' Islamists attack US embassy in Tehran and held hostage 52 diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States-who supported his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation was not n' l' Administration d' positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because qu' she would severely undermined the confidence of its allies in d' other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to l' establishment d' a theocratic regime, she n' was able d' secure the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">C' was a blow to the prestige of the United-States, compounded later by the fiasco of the attempted rescue of hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kidnapped diplomats were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations by the Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate to United States-led a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Iranian debacle contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film l' Argo, director and actor Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory at l' America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before qu' it is occupied, six employees of escaped s' l' Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="12">After ups complicated, they found themselves in the residence of l' ambassador for Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to break d' Iran through hay coverage: They left the country with Canadian passports as members d' a film crew doing locations for filming a movie d' dramatic science-fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The l' exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required collaboration d' Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To make the legend more credible, specialized magazines made this draft film, press conferences were held and a production company fictive had real offices.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of secret operation l' were long, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film d' Affleck is a combination of several genera.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a s' d' d' a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story d' a successful d' a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy as Ocean', twelve and thirteen.</seg>
<seg id="20">The atmospheres: Sequences of Tehran (in documentary style sequences are presented under-titr√©es iconic photographs of time l' events and how, through these photographs, these situations have been transcribed in the film, he n' no major differences),</seg>
<seg id="21">Passages lighter d' Hollywood, treated with irony and a little d' exaggeration</seg>
<seg id="22">And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions d' with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables in the corridors and the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">Actor D' ridiculed, he became a respected director and actor d' ceased to generate mannerisms.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature-film after the dark officer "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">C' is also the first film Affleck d' who does not take place in his city d' origin, Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of atmosphere l' d' l' a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films in top-Hollywood standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck is also proof of this sense of l' atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held by Canada."</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts; the initial sequence of the fall of l' Embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests confusion and l' unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, s' wrote a page d' history.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the false crew in the bazaar of Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too d' shares to too d' places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to settle a matter d' n' offering in fact that few exciting film scenes, in the sense of the term.</seg>
<seg id="33">He s' doing well, he adds some elements to reality and the result is not always n' elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis l' airport in Tehran is overcome by a phone call in America and continuing on the runway landing d' are quite farfetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weak d' Argo lies in his character dispelled, due to the need to show too d' events in too d' locations.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is true S' qu' Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters merited place and this is not far from there, only in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film d' Affleck lack a bit of tension, he suggests with moderate interest, enjoying the retro 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">It causes the viewer, but with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder, d' d' a story still somehow incomplete to date, and as an illustration of the exaggeration of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, l' case.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry into bank charges the most absurd, decided, now, to launch the regulation or ideas from "workshop" l' EU most absurd.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The fact that EU envisages l' recently, d' adopt a quota of 40 per-cent of women for the management of large European companies was l' origin of our decision," said the newspaper Pr√°vo l' organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court d' unify d' insurance premiums for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jusqu' now yet women were advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent qu', objectively, a lower risk for companies d' insurance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">People can report jusqu' at the end of year l' any idea of "incredible workshop l' l' EU."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013" informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial l' EU regulations, for example, l' obligation d' add components bio fuels, which has detrimental consequences for l' environment, or ban l' d' use the reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain qu' relatively low d' a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size cages chickens, which resulted in l' increase in the prices of eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Critics have also been issued in the past to l' l' prohibition against de facto d' use l' expression "butter spreads" or withdrawal of the sale of light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Quality bananas must have a size 14 centimetres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">L' European administration reacts often under pressure d' a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a State or group d' states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes requests for its banks threatening d' use his veto).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, l' origin of the fact that in l' Union, bananas must not be d' a smaller size to 14 cm or submit a curvature "abnormal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission is defended s' arguing qu' she did qu' harmonize national standards nonhomogeneous complicating the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite l' opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives wasteful of foodstuffs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The first prize will be awarded in this survey of EU l' l' last year that must be on balloons a warning that children under 8 years should not inflate unattended d' adults.</seg>
<seg id="16">EU L' referred to a U.S. survey that the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death by suffocation d' children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction s' applies to children under 14 years with regard to blow into trumpets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here also, strange ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The following rule regarding European officials them-same is quite absurd: Because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, anyone who has an official function within l' EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should, instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In collaboration with l' association "Leave To" of liberal economists, the server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com appointed in this survey, in addition to absurdities mentioned ci-dessus, l' Union concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">EU L' had set maximum volumes for the reserves of foodstuffs which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to EU l'.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic, for example, then increased volumes set for only canned mushrooms and, as a result, a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of this investigation found interesting l' idea to pay sums d' money in some countries because they have not n' qu' d' access to the sea and l' idea d' grant a grant to ask l' subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas are not from Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The fact of not having to sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will ask l' European Union reimbursement. "Thus s' l' is expressed in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture l' l' time Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">It argued that, because of our production of wheat, and procurement expressed "interventionist", the State 's' was found with stocks full qu' he had then export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, l' EU should have we pay millions d' euros, because the Czech Republic is located far from ports.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a call for tenders d' l' purchase of wheat from the country without marine access.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for l' obtaining grants were proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU), those-ci, concretely, should be used to write applications for grants from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">L' EU states: "Bizarre regulations are rare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">If the regulations are often critics in the Member States, according to many experts, efforts by l' EU regulation and improve l' d' effective operation of l' Union and in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Worse, for example, according to experts, the problem of l' use of l' EU grants for projects that n' have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening l' European integration, but have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of d' l' Union, fight in Brussels for the right d' use specific names for these traditional products (which she does not always winner) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomouck√© tvar≈Ø≈æky", in the name of "l' Tuzemsk√Ω rum" dating back to the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "Tuzem√°k."</seg>
<seg id="36">Only the products alcohol d' cane sugar, and not with beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products of EU l' found in aujourd' company globally known as the Feta cheese or Gorgonzola, L√ºbeck marzipan or Parma ham and biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarsk√© suchary"), the carp and Poho≈ôelice T≈ôebo≈à ("Poho≈ôelick√Ω has T≈ôebo≈àsk√Ω kapr") and hops in ≈Ωatec ("≈Ωateck√Ω chmel").</seg>
<seg id="38">Spice bread d' Pardubice ("Pardubick√Ω pern√≠k") and cakes called "Cornets of Ho≈ôice" ("ho≈ôick√© trubiƒçky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.</seg>

<seg id="13">My purpose is not n' function, ci-qu' n' is a tool allowing me to make my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">C' is why j' ai besoin de l' influence the largest and the broader mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not only n' qu' as a nation we r√¢lons at the bar or in front of the television, but is also c' and trampling all those who try d' bring the change.</seg>
<seg id="16">This adds s' press fragmenting the reputation of persons and confounds freedom of speech and freedom of lying.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, for example, what I said to my misreporting journalists or j' have been Councillor Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek.</seg>

<seg id="18">Just-in your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You started the fight for Ch√¢teau with as workhorse themes of material responsibility and criminal politicians and tax returns retroactive to beyond-20 million of CZK [.]</seg>
<seg id="20">So, you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president, you do not have such a power d' and only the Senate as a whole may propose legislation.</seg>

<seg id="23">Lorsqu' as a citizen, j' have lobbied for the activities of tourist guide is a liberal profession, j' have prevailed.</seg>

<seg id="25">As an independent, no party member d' j' have much more likely d' gain the support of all parliamentary parties.</seg>

<seg id="42">I must convince politicians, journalists and l' public and try to get them to my camp to impose l'.</seg>
<seg id="43">If j' was elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on material responsibility and criminal politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>

<seg id="52">I am not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know qu' one person cannot make a difference, c' is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run the senatorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="54">Met J' Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">J' have at least supported the journalist Jana Lorencov√° d' investigation revealed that fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I presented because people are really upset but now j' hesitates.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people n' have not voted and what l' did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of l' establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, there are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have elected a Senate could hardly impose changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example l' the direct election of mayors and prefects regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Consider-you to create your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">No, not yet, because I n' not have time to check if the past of each member potential is spotless and then I n' have not the financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have n' not d' money for my presidential campaign, I have n' twenty thousand on my account "transparent".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have not n' d' money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk of tax returns, what is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">J' estimated about 60 million worth of my personal property.</seg>
<seg id="67">J' have to Prague a ground d' worth 25 million, an apartment d' a value of 10 million, another apartment 8 million worth, a collection of art works d' d' value d' d' approximately ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb d' a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because c' was a dream of kid: J' have always loved James Bond, travelling by car, was with women and fought against evil and abuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage d' worth 60 million and you have not n' d' money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your money?</seg>
<seg id="71">This n' is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have not n' 15 million for this campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I should m' debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">J' have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no n' sponsor shows that my programme does not generate a great interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">I have not n' l' obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">My campaign costs are generally covered by remuneration that I will receive as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I could not live on, e.g. pay l' English school of my son costing 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If my sole objective was to earn l' money, I will present in any elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You will therefore continue your commercial activities to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">N'-you had not said that you would your activities in the background?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this n' is not related to the amount of such remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, l' j' have partially reduced my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my assistant will spring the direction of l' travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="85">People want I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">I won and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only d' imagination. For s' suffices to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something d' interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a low-traffic on the side of the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, a computer in a large company neighbour, said: "Yes, it is fine, this building."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we still need today aujourd' d' a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has an iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aujourd', nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries, elderly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a city that has nothing dormitory-n' d' attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commune of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate education d' des Pays-Bas.</seg>
<seg id="9">To restore some neurons brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven bridges fictional appearing on tickets d' euros in the form of small reinforced concrete painted miniatures.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of l' cultural offensive remained limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">C' is that the authorities of the city realized qu' n' qu' it was the only way to resume the hand of statistics: Construction d' library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, d' architects of Rotterdam, MVRDV charts adventurous and creative d' buildings full d' spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the board members were still puzzled and increasing shoulders, Maas, brash, l' laid them his books of choice in order of size for a pyramid and finished his speech substantiated d' arguments activists by a common: "Dear!"</seg>
<seg id="14">La voil√†, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros d' has sprung.</seg>
<seg id="16">Building L' s' enshrined in a revitalization project with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">C' is that this small town dull, who today to jusqu' aujourd' n' had nothing more to offer a postmodern qu' pedestrian zone and a town hall d' a staggering ugliness, whose white fa√ßades invite to think qu' harbour a dairy, s' is enriched d' an architectural work.</seg>
<seg id="20">What is most important is that c' Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to reading</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Eldorado Book under bell to cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lift takes you through the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture l' s' open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">Internal L' made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch and the brick floor lamps unequivocally elegant speak the language of municipal squares.</seg>
<seg id="25">L' urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is already the gaze of benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books and books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally, library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explained Willy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have completely changed the classic spatial and open spaces of reading l' interior to l' outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inside the mountain L' books has been skillfully arranged: In the middle are the offices, the Internet, the club d' failures, the center for l' environment and the technique of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A particular beauty lies in the annals of the library, which are sometimes panelling, balustrades, sometimes ramps d' stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">A new experience for sight, touch and l' smell.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and building engineers hardened do not want unknown materials.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse in a response to the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thus C' qu' one day we found in farming ad hoc Frisian waste from l' agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Aux Pays-Bas, has been used for years of the synthetic membrane d' a millimetre thick d' as substrate in greenhouses and fields.</seg>
<seg id="37">C' is cheap and l' it saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin membrane is used for a season or two, then we can discard.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities in plates d' four centimetres thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under l' heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, odour l' evokes both a new car and sports footwear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">After nearly 500 meters, the literary caf√© offers a view over the city, but also of Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.</seg>
<seg id="43">They create an atmosphere, but they contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity d' l' mountain air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for new l' soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"C' is incredible, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in d' ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The temperature of l' building is regulated by geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books is below d' a belljar, the sun illuminates n' that shortly l' Interior, even the days of good weather.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thick wooden beams mounted through the glass facade are Persian-sun, intercepting a large part of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="49">L' ambient atmosphere is very enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fully automated blinds will do the rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, IT l' septic, s' is already risky to enter the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette Verhaig also was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, described as "the Boekenberg l' soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a few weeks when l' inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate d' a book based on his personal library.</seg>
<seg id="55">This measure has helped to fill the gaps in the library n' was not yet fully stocked (aujourd' today, it has 70,000 pounds).</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is a success.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves overflow from all sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">For l' architect Winy Maas, "he n' was nothing worse qu' library half empty."</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if this n' is that for decoration. "</seg>
<seg id="62">C' is as MVRDV reached mistress qu' discipline, in the jargon, "the establishment d' identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote a new page d' literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Although it may seem young and educated.</seg>
<seg id="65">He s' d' is finally a new starting point for birth d' identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans should play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">L' Germany chose l' abstention in the vote on l' admission of l' Palestinian State.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, expert relations between the United States and EU-l' this decision is Berlin in a delicate political situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, l' Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of d' Palestinian status d' Observer State of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was then chosen l' abstention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: L' Germany n' not approve what Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Berlin should exercise caution, because it has special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But I also think it qu' does not support the US position.</seg>
<seg id="10">L' Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being overly critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At l' insurgency in Libya in March 2011, l' Germany had also chosen l' abstention in the vote on the implementation d' a d' exclusion zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, l' NATO imposed this measure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany L' feels she-difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that Berlin is overhauling its foreign policy, seeking to move s' d' a policy virtually defined by Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the lack of consistent policy and common within Union l' complicates the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are thus faced on several fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Awaiting them d' qu' they play a more independent role, but they n' are not used.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe qu' they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the way d' a foreign policy more "normal".</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as in France or Great-Britain</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">That means when the term "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the d' will adopt positions beyond those of the United-States and European partners, including as regards national records.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Near-East.</seg>
<seg id="24">German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: C' is why l' Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests are-they influenced the position of l' Germany vis-√†-vis the conflict in the Middle-East and l' abstained from the UN vote?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany has L' first d' d' significant opportunities in the Near-East, especially in the Gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">C' is why Berlin must be careful not to offend l' public, but also the elites of Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">He is undoubtedly s' d' a determining factor.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, I would not be n' too d' importance, because it does not s' relationship exclusively unilateral.</seg>
<seg id="30">But c' is in any case a determining factor in the German strategic thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany L' night-it to its relations with the United States-choosing l' abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">C' is why I think the n' divide is not so bad she qu' l' was in the case of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even that may be-n' l' Germany should be respected.</seg>
<seg id="35">Indeed, l' Germany has demonstrated qu' it must be taken seriously as an international actor qu' and that its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, the views on l' Palestinian initiative are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="37">By contrast, the United States-announced their veto d' a clear voice.</seg>
<seg id="38">Opinions differ-they-between the United States and the majority of European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There have always been differences due to US domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think l' Obama Administration is secretly evidence d' great understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But given the political complexion of the country, the government cannot of course not defend its position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences d' opinions are not so great qu' they always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice qu' Obama is far from overflow d' l' enthusiasm to the policy of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">She-L' Germany has difficulties in reconciling its close relationship with Israel and the United States-, d' a share, with the position of the major European partners, other d'?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think it does not make things for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Obviously, it would be a little easier for Germans s' there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but aujourd' n', this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot therefore not s' d' register within a broader policy and must assert their unique position.</seg>
<seg id="48">This C' qu' they are currently in the issue of l' euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">In my opinion, l' Germany will assume future l' a pioneering role and cause l' Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is not easy for n' l' Germany, particularly because relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This question has always been difficult.</seg>
<seg id="52">But to me, the Germans are well aware qu' they must play a role which marks more independence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">L' Germany is-it play a role d' player on the international scene, l' Germany wants it-play a key role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or was she always-difficulties to assume leadership roles?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany L' n' is still not used, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If l' we look, for example, the crisis of l' euro, qu' whenever l' Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands are heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not make things for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, c' is always the same problem: It does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this perspective, l' Germany is in a far worse position that Member-States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must contend with neighbours and opinions varied, and this n' is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">, Aujourd' l' influence of United States-on European policy is that decline, but at the moment, l' EU does not fill this vacuum-advantage, then who is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans should simply play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant and s' n' that they are less appreciated c' is life!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trademarks in China:" When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Armani Polo... what is s'-it really?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but n' has nothing to do with l' company.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mark has thus d' protection such as l' company that bears the name cannot complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even if it could, he is not sure she qu' n' would succeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of ownership in Far-East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, a new folder on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Imitators n' need some extra letters to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the manufacturer d' sporting goods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file in which are the registrations with l' trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in s' with part of the name d' Ermenegildo Zegna, the house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">C' is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities, there are shopping malls on several floors that sell almost that counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cases of Pattloch are different: His constituents the handle s' attack that l' Chinese Trademark Office formally conferred to Chinese companies the right d' use a name that is already protected in another country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai parent," brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">C' is with this term that are designated women who marry to wealthy men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities say n' have nothing to hide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"C' is bad for business, we must combat this trend," requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The mark is diluted, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and court fees for millions in the sectors concerned, especially as regards the flagship products expensive.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the data of society d' market analysis CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of d' 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury products and the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, he n' is not easy to cancel registrations dubious of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">They can last jusqu' to nine years, and after l' n' is never certain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reported trials in which the Court dismissed the complaint, after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a reality "market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Pattloch explains that if the complainant n' has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to l' plagiarist, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this area, c' is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases include graphics.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery maker Sany, the same company that came to redeem the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">C' is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles l' star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely, l' acquisiteur Volvo, used before a logo blue and white reminiscent of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="36">L' trademark office in Beijing CTMO recognizes experiencing difficulties in 2010 because d' a lack of personnel and d' space.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, l' Office would be spent last year l' d' d' an "emergency situation in the workflow to normality found."</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the number of procedures opposition d' untreated would have fallen by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to previous year l'.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding l' office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Act expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the CTMO L' received more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third of more qu' in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to l' s' d' Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive year in our leaderboards for the number of new deposits in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This should also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is $5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, l' was recorded 1.8 billion yuan of law d' registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, each recording d' reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">A legal battle is much more like l' illustrates the case of l' Freudenberg German family company.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, l' company fights against a plagiarist Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="50">Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, l' imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"C' is our fault because the surnames cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">L' Trademark Office had dismissed l' objection of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freudenberg has prevailed with the two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight to aujourd' jusqu'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Vigilance is required</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">, Aujourd' l' case is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, he added: "The procedure is long, hard and cost us a lot of time and money d'."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is also difficult to assess d' internal costs. The archives even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to bring d' evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This C' qu' you see what it is for us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="20">Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller d' stories" or "praise singer."</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody can speak the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this foreign language qu' she has brought in Germany for now make it to his hometown: Southern l' Africa.</seg>

<seg id="27">To Esitjeni, you can see on a smaller scale the ills Swaziland: Rates d' HIV infection l' the highest and lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF l'.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population n' accepts virtually never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven risk reduction d' infection by half.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most common sexually transmitted infections?</seg>
<seg id="36">Among the bacterial STIs, syphilis, chlamydi√©es and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhea).</seg>
<seg id="37">STDs or HIV, HPV, herpes l' or l' hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic lice and scabies belong to STIs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the groups concerned?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea are often among men who have sex with men d'.</seg>
<seg id="41">L' Robert Koch-Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are l' origin d' at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">Adult heterosexual infections linked to chlamydi√©es, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are of common sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur within this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people, there is a rate d' chlamydi√©es infections associated with significantly higher than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">D' after European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What is l' evolution in the number d' infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">He n' is not required to report all sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to l' Robert Koch-Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: The figure rose from 1.967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This represents a decrease d' one tenth compared to previous year l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms d' sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, pain, urinary losses white, pain in the lower abdomen and l'-onset of buttons and warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, they train regularly n' pain or other symptoms and thus remain hidden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How to protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk d' infection, but they do not protect 100%.</seg>
<seg id="58">The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted through infected Grease or narrow body contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Experts recommend to anyone changing often sexual partners of regular breast examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">Most STIs can be cured quickly detected and the late sequelae can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds reap the choristers thanks to their voices through l' Germany, s' accumulate.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Overall, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of l' association.</seg>
<seg id="63">The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets this qu' she wants, manages l' money from l' Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It also ensures that orphans are well housed in one of their great-mothers for example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The victims, c' is called qu' older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some d' them serve jusqu' to 14 orphans, they provide shelter and ensure they qu' commute to l' hour l' school in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">L' n' orphan who has no one is allowed in a safe place in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by l' association, like the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a school sewing and allowed the construction of two barns. With the help of l' American organization for health PSI, l' association has organized an HIV test for many people.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not of itself, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king and his 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is a real taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because c' is an issue that affects sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">C' is quite curious d', from a country whose king has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of l' black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">These mores l' State sanctioned by, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">Migrant workers are also spread the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are however condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different, flesh against flesh. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to encourage somewhat l' cultural exchange, the choristers d' Imbongi leave together on a trip every two or three years in southern Africa l' and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and d' black identity that many d' inhabitants of the tip of the black continent are still time l' apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus blanks singing in African language is a sign of recognition as qu' it generates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes a tear a formidable-border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The bus takes always Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even s' it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of l' Ezulweni.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light", say people l√†-bas.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres d' bird flight, back in Heidelberg, before these choristers who tap their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Stra√üe, there is also the light.</seg>

<seg id="52">Since then, mirrors optical telescopes n' have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in l' universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory l' near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, l'-United States is the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows d' observe l' universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The belly of Gran Canarias Great in La Palma, Canary Islands is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.</seg>
<seg id="59">Diameter reached approximately 11 metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">L' disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is attached to the level of l' vertical angle, which limits mobility.</seg>

<seg id="35">Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">What is the reason for longevity in the south of the country?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guide, the Azeri, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.</seg>
<seg id="38">By contrast, Fatulayeva, Museum Director, think c' is a question d' diet.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, it does not seem plausible, d' nutritionally, meals high in calories Talysh, who love the bread and meat, dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is this-a simple lifestyle that preserves the youth people? To Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With its 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house of wood, as is typical d' see throughout the Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">She is sitting on the floor beside a d' churn, it beats the content.</seg>

<seg id="48">J' have always washed my hair with milk and c' is that I have never lost and qu' they kept their colour.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "Human Rights l'" omitted in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution was reborn in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rival demonstrations show the great divide the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The draft constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Egyptian President n' is not short on words full d' emotions.</seg>
<seg id="6">We must succeed the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And this is my responsibility to the people and to God," said negotiations-television d' State.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was intended for the entire people, but also to Copts Christians, the Liberals, Muslim and secular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because all members of l' confused and disunited opposition desperately afraid.</seg>
<seg id="10">They fear d' a theocracy on the Nile to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohamed Morsi said, almost s' condoning, having temporarily restricts the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its "to save the revolution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, the Egyptians and the world knows what wants to save the engineer 61, a Ph.D. from d' l' American University of Southern California.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The judiciary will be reversed-advantage?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The 234 articles in haste by l' constituent assembly muslim d' 100 people during a tour de force of fifteen hours are disturbing to some extent.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the decision is based on "the principles of Islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what really means the word "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">C' was and remains a question d' interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and flexibility legal means to implement a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In any case c' is that suggests a newly introduced article stating that, as regards all topics related to sharia law, al-Azhar University l' must be consulted. L' l' Islamic institution is the largest in the country and lustre radiates throughout the Islamic world.</seg>
<seg id="19">This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor l' legislature, which would de facto the guardianship of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the reign of Mubarak, these courts s' tried to stifle opponents.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator, jusqu' to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.</seg>
<seg id="24">L' State must also, can-you read in the project, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote morality and values."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">D' a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions l' State may even control the content of l' art film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Clearly, it would simply s' censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In addition, no Article expressly guarantees l' equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead, another prohibits d' offend or to defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, l' article does not define qu' is an offence or how it must be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is suggesting qu' it is prohibited to '"offend people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It-enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense d' a law?</seg>
<seg id="32">Many points are open to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote which, in his own words, "soon" object l' d' a referendum of the Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Reborn" revolution</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">L' opposition mobilizes for several weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual accord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to topple qu' Sharia before it enters into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution is reborn and we will win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-head of l' International Atomic Energy Agency l' Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history l'."</seg>
<seg id="38">On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to foment a "coup against democracy."</seg>
<seg id="39">"S' he proclaims the referendum, to his palace and the reverse," says s' Jasser Said, an opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers n' is not yet atoned for," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of l' opposition.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, several judges announced not wanting to monitor the referendum that involve its invalidity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our Constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a demonstration against-not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on l' Nile, where a large prayer was organized in l' University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people are asking for l' application of the law of God."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Cleans our country!" They asked-to Morsi, asserting that "the Koran [their] Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where it all started, quickly created a situation similar to d' a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Obviously, c' is what Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim Brotherhood has alleged that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as his supporters were expressed s' loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes from the direction of the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">The project Islamists will win the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The rights of man l' are not mentioned once"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed should have extend jusqu' in February and encompass all social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This lawyer on Human Rights l' 48 years and president of l' l' Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood lorsqu' they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">He l' did not because qu' he shared their world view, but because the l' human rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">C' is why he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now, the term is not even n' delivered once in the new Constitution," regrets-advantage during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.</seg>
<seg id="57">Morsi L' extension of the powers of the three powers discouraged l' lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are glaring violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president removes all its powers," deplores Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could afford.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian s' rakfisk: Is it-fish the strongest scent of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million people in Norway d' have one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could-be linked to appetite l' premises for a fish extremely fragrant?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">The put-in a pile of clothes d' football wet and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wait a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you get l' smell of rakfisk l' disturbing, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours d' Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It snow, the landscape is dramatically - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates l' air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in l' water during a period - according to l' smell that you want it qu' exhaling ‚Äî which can go jusqu' to a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When l' s' qu' dark and cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, Fagernes, devoted to this incredible delicacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass d' aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full time that l' Rakfisk also called "General", responsible for the management of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us, people ingest small pieces of fish and s' dons a large quantity of drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people prefer l' aquavit in rakfisk," adds Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The beverage kills l' smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">J' tries a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid the pass under your nose, this n' is not bad - this brings to mind a sushi who reportedly spent long hours in a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before l' invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in barriques d' sealed l' air, water and salt in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, during winter, l' once fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the meaning undermined by l' alcohol - eaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, emigrant mainly to Member-States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the higher salaries and a comprehensive health system.</seg>
<seg id="22">Swedes, their old rivals including the country was not so long ago n' richer than Norway, cross the border to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered something important d', a vital element, well, qu' past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is part of the more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="25">But everything is expensive - a small pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 ‚Ç¨each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often speak d' it in the international news, which n' is not to displease him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here, people are unwilling to speak d' Anders Breivik, the racist extreme rightist who killed 77 people, including women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Lorsqu' they evoke the killing, they speak of "l' incident of 22 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their country, a peaceful l' could commit such a barbaric act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, l' one of the largest in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil n' is no single reason for our success," said Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes d' transfixing, l' image of well-being, with a plateau of rakfisk by hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are - how you say-- people conservative.</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are discreet, we n' not like we do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously - all l' exception d' a small percentage d' money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When d' other countries threw l' money through the windows, over the years we have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse tightly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"Until l' you can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," said Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Without forgetting the rakfisk-," she adds with a laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am standing under snow and I am queuing up to buy m' food - j' have had my share of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the menu, a hamburger composed d' momentum, a real discovery, c' is excellent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But tonight, l' smell of fish is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">L' hotel where I stayed l' is one of the many places that serve l' rakfisk l' for dinner and where you can vote for the best d' them ‚Äî or may be-for most fragrant d' between them.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a TV where the presenter wears a knot-butterfly, surrounded d' rakfisk bases.</seg>
<seg id="44">Traveling l' Eurovision contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What have you score-provided the best fish in the mountains-Juergen guess?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Our points, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">One hears laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls from her chair, could-be l' abuse d' aquavit.</seg>

<seg id="18">The military judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning has also asked why it was not s' complained about his treatment at d' an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that s' had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts qu' he had expressed by writing a few months earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify its status restrictive indicating a "risk of injury".</seg>
<seg id="20">The military said qu' they assigned him this status restrictive -- a level below the surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted staff know that j' was okay, and I wanted l' I withdraw this status d'... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before d' be transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said he considered suicide lorsqu' he was in Kuwait and s' have vanished once because of heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He added that not having been informed of this qu' was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, cage," said Manning, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought j' was going to die in the cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Once at Quantico, Manning said qu' he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes over 23 hours -- without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning has also added that the only objects were mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothing and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He tried to stay in movement, because sleep or lie down for the day was contrary to the regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning also indicated that lorsqu' he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit in l' outside his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the guards did not see her face lorsqu' he turned the night, they would in order to see his face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Manning L' lawyer filed a formal complaint to the treatment by Manning in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- qu' after being forced to sleep naked in a night in his cell at Quantico, l' forced to stand naked in front of other prisoners and guards d' one morning during l' appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning testified qu' at no time, he was only allowed to cover with coverage for l' appeal.</seg>
<seg id="36">For questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said qu' he had deducted from l' order of his guard qu' it would release its coverage to hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered the release.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday qu' he had been forced to sleep naked in the previous night, as he tried to prove to an officer qu' he n' was not a danger pour lui-m√™me.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning reportedly told l' qu' officer he could use his elastic l' slip or tongs to injury, but he did qu' l' had not done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">This night-l√†, Manning testified that his under-clothing, tongs, and his glasses were removed from his cell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers hope qu' at least the judge will consider experiments qu' he experienced during his detention and qu' it will significantly reduce his sentence s' it should be convicted by court martial, a trial which should be held in early d' next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty of offences and fight for l' abandonment d' other charges considered too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">L' hearing should resume this week-end, with prosecutors that should be argued that the conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of prisoners at Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Heads d' to l' charges against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with l' enemy, giving rise to the publication of information on illegal Internet l', and transmission d' information relating to the national defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If all heads d' charges are retained, it faces life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="1">My identity crisis Mexico-U.S.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack d' opportunities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans difficult times, has-advantage said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says the Mexico-U.S. are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico d', arriving in the lobby before customs and immigration d', I felt lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs indicated two paths: One for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what to queue.</seg>
<seg id="8">J' grew up in central California, where it l' m' called the "Mexican" all my life.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a qualifier s' d' ethnic, in the same way as friends of Boston use lorsqu' they say Irish ", or" friends of New York lorsqu' they say "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Then I became "Mexico-American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here was c' Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, on the land that has seen my grand-father, no need to qualifier or special line d' union.</seg>
<seg id="13">J' was simply an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in l' l' one or another language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I have not n' vocabulary d' an Aboriginal person, and I cannot lose my accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Then j' American took my passport and I headed toward the line "Strangers."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">J' have thought about this time-the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama, at the Maison-Blanche.</seg>
<seg id="18">Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their main themes are l' immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of l' l' Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than venture Member-States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wished to s'-ally of the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of l' European Union, but in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto s' committed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, he qu' n' did not provide further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States-filled d' is complicated and bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans n' have probably never thought about the fact qu' in 1848, Member-States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their territory at gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, from qu' an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of l' against Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children of Montezuma seek the fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult is that with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United-States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want qu' it addresses the subject of bitter l'?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are many.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and other d' for whom the country n' not offer them.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason for the large number d' Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio, is qu' at one point in our family tree, a person can be-parent or grand-parent, n' found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most often, this person was a profile -- a brown, poorly educated, from a poor village d', etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even if we are currently experiencing the American dream, we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that c' is the American dream that we live, and not the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="37">We attach to l' Member-States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, we know qu' part of l' Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn ‚Äô t like.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were individuals and not enough to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be quite good, our ties with Mexico will never be enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">For them, our existence is synonymous d' failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families n' had not failed lorsqu' they lived in Mexico, they would never parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we would not stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United-States, but as lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States qu'-when she was a child, remember qu' there is friction between Mexicans and the Mexico-Americans, Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans are upset.</seg>
<seg id="46">Well qu' it is American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Furthermore, many Mexico-Americans I know not n' l' impression to join d' a country or other l'.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in neither.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we regard as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the United-States, we regard as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And now, for a little more complicated the relationship, as I l' have learned during my stay, Mexican leaders and part of l' intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexico-Americans working as qu' ambassadors of fortune to Mexico, representing its interests in the United-States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We must explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country qu' absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">This n'.</seg>
<seg id="57">There are too d' bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, if considered l' inequalities in pay, corruption and violence related to drugs that are ubiquitous, many d' us are not confident qu' s' d' he is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">C' is normal.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United-States for the way they have dealt Mexico a century and a half ago, they should therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans always want them how family members were treated it n' not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Can be-are-we more "Mexicans" than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old quarrels, new Middle-East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The stop-the-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">-advantage can never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle-East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed suggests qu' such hope is vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the same arguments futile to know which began, dozens of buildings were pulverized; more than 140 d' Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis d' Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But although Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict around d' them, the Middle-East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has just shattered, and qu' we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are overtaken by this upheaval.</seg>
<seg id="8">Would-be that their fight s' deepen a little more.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help us out of this impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war which is no loser or winner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate d' optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the stop-the-fire granted on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened supporters of force, on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement who heads the Gaza since 2007 targueront d' forcing Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza suffered a beating.</seg>
<seg id="14">Killing some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million d' l' Gazans in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded planet, Israel n' has failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, l' other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah l' other Palestinian faction, more moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Furthermore, Hamas leaders might say that the time is their ally.</seg>
<seg id="17">L' influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas s' is rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regional power booming, formerly l' Muslim ally closest d' Israel, sided with Hamas; like Qatar, l' one of the richest and most dynamic Golf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hamas members are growing and say that the Islamist bends around d' Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, through Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can reverse Bashar Assad, and jusqu' to Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And most importantly, on the southern flank d' Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the central Arab countries, has changed l' balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt l' for 30 years to jusqu' fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders s' l' recover more easily to public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as actor qu' d' importance which cannot be excluded even by Israel and l' America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the hardliners d' Israel will reverse the conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The system d' intercept missiles called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, America l' reiterates its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized the Hamas d' be l' origin of the latest wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">But above all, Israel has flourished, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime-Minister, which ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the firing of rockets from Gaza killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that impinge on the West Bank, the piece of what could be a Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand s' despite their illegality in terms of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud Party merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader in l' approach l' election of January 22, has the beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why pamper those pesky by giving them a Palestinian state?</seg>
<seg id="33">S' they ran the West Bank, do they not lanceraient-rockets, as their compatriots l' have done in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is best to keep them behind the wall and hit from qu' they leave the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Would-be that the hardliners will l'; but it is possible that the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists, who took power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation Israel, their priority will be to s' address the problems in their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defence budget d' Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the local n' superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a stop-the-fire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should also think about l' future.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world who becomes more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to selfdetermination l' could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode in the territories occupied by Israel ‚Äî a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression weakens already democracy in l' Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to Hamas have a price diplomatically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need d' be driven by those l' outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer remains as advocated by reasonable people that l' found on each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: Two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, small and short term, is that the stop-the-fire will l' opportunity outsiders to defend this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">L' Egypt, who must now s' to stop traffic d' weapons into Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned to persuade Hamas d' accept l' idea d' a Jewish state within the 1967 borders with land swaps and Jerusalem shared.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to qu' they s' unite.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would contribute more to the establishment d' a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a pseudo d' l' United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama has also benefit from this qu' Israel agrees to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he n' has not submitted a peace plan of his own.</seg>
<seg id="52">Back at the Maison-Blanche, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.</seg>
<seg id="53">C' vision is a very narrow.</seg>
<seg id="54">The stability of the Middle-East is vital for l' America.</seg>
<seg id="55">This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings and photos d' diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all the same, whatever the brand</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This Act came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and d' horrific photos d' diseased organs and representations d' children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the mark, printed in small print on all packages.</seg>
<seg id="5">He s' is the most stringent in the world d' package of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government said that l' objective was to deter youth smoking by deleting any representation glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Studies have shown that if people were not n' started smoking before age l' 26 years, there were 99% chance qu' they never starts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even lorsqu' they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek MP, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associated d' crown logo to a princess. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although l' Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes n' d' have little impact on the profits of multinationals, d' other countries are considering a similar approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">L' tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco manufacturers said that it would boost trade of black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The consequences of this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters of China and Indonesia d' sell more counterfeit cigarettes into the streets d' Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other D' stated that this Act boosted their activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the request d' cigarette cases, including silicone mask the horrific packaging, has sharply increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain' if Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the High Court d' Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, the cases are good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws banning ads on TV, sports sponsorship and l' obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia L' banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites d'.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you work in tobacco marketing and you do more than d' a small window to promote your products, l' Internet is the place par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at l' University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman noticed increased contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of trademarks on social media services like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">We must ask ourselves s' s' d' he is an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and s' is bothered to make a video, or is it s' s' d' a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia said that l' industry focuses on the new regulation rather than on marketing.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="26">A decision of l' WTO should be taken in the course of l' 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek MP said the government had held discussions with d' other countries with similar laws on packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos d' warning on packages in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine l'.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tougher legislation are currently l'-study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>

<seg id="20">After numerous publications and subjected l' idea to a discussion group d' about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined l' boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without managing to engage in an activity satisfactory."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What differentiates l' boredom of l' apathy, said-it, c' n' is that the person is not a task qu' d' it would like.</seg>
<seg id="22">With l' apathy, said-it, not n' l' want to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What is at the heart of l' boredom, has-advantage said, is "c' l' process d' attention, associated with a grumpy and the sense that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">L' boredom may strongly resemble depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, those who miss s' tend to think that the problem of l' environment or of the world, while depressed persons think the problem is d' them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we may think that we are then qu' s' d' there is a problem of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice d' someone reading a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high a d' TV which n' was no report, other d' have just heard l' TV, and the third group n' has not heard the Gaza-sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who have heard the TV to low noise level qu' s' said they were more sensitive than the other two groups - they struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration at l' boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you try to focus on a difficult task or, an interruption of l' attention can lead to boredom l', said Mark J. Fenske, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and a l' l' authors l' study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In contrast, when you make a boring, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you do not get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, said-it, now we know that lorsqu' it wiggles or qu' you scribble, these actions, often considered signs d' boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggling learn more and retain more d' information that those who are forced to move," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We are all one day or another l' - the delay of my flight d' plane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a film particularly troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more likely to s' bore that d' others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale predisposition to l' boredom" in the 1980s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Scale L' includes statements like, "Among the tasks that j' performs many d' them are repetitive and monotonous", and "j' have so many centres d' interest that I n' not have time to do everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to s' bore more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have need of many and varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development to l' University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.</seg>
<seg id="41">He noted that 32 percent of teens reported s' l' bore to school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported they bore s' lorsqu' n' l' were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported s' bore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know whether qu' percentages d' d' aujourd' boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he added qu' he knew "l' adolescence is a period where l' boredom reached its highest level", particularly because children and adolescents n' have little control over this qu' they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If I: L' boredom is-it good for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take risks physical absurd, placing bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between l' boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"L' boredom is the way that the brain has found to inform you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain is not always what is most appropriate to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, this will make you happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch TV, this will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child s' bored and you give it an iPad, it will s' n' more, but he has learned to occupy s' alone or s' autor√©gler, says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this autor√®glement passes d' one situation to another," says-.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child n' learns not just to entertain, he gets more than control-d' him even in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think we should glorify l' boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">As I do not believe that we should criticise.</seg>
<seg id="57">Feel at ease l' outside the constant flurry that generate the activities and technology is l' goal towards which we should strive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood is d' agreement on this point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We need to be bored more often, but l' boredom is an acute desire and frenzied d' be connected to something that makes sense, "-advantage said.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to him, what people want, c' is a way to disconnect and d' appreciate the time d' judgment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimul√©s-advantage," said, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when noise s' stops."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado, no directive to the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, 19, a student in a university and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon be legal in his state: Possession of marijuana and pellets d' une pipe used for smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said qu' one day in September, he and some friends were aboard a car at d' Lamar, in the middle of fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4">After l' police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for drug possession and equipment suitable for consumption - minor offences, each s' accompanying d' fined $100 - and a court appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But is it a-?</seg>
<seg id="7">During the weeks d' uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds d' cases involving low use of drugs depends more on the place of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Here and in l' state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving l' marijuana have been discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stopped d' charge of adults aged 21 and minor for possession of marijuana, because the legislation will come into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors who are in the exchanges more conservative Colorado called to accelerate the affairs of marijuana and continue d' indicted persons who possess.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver jusqu' to the mountains of western l' vote now to prevent l' opening shops selling marijuana approved by l' State in their neighbourhoods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what we reserve l' future," said Daniel J. Oates, the Chief of Police d' Aurora, l' is Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Regulators in Washington State l' also raises a lot of questions.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are seeking guidance on how d' install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 31 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, qu' we like it or not, is ahead of most state regulatory on marijuana, first d' concerning l' Therapeutic Use Exemptions and now as regards l' personal use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, door-floor of Washington State Liquor Control Board.</seg>
<seg id="17">But no place or system recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He n' has no real precedent on which we could build ,-advantage said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, which s' called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum d' a year, during which the permit system n' will always be, while the possession of marijuana is legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: How to balance the mandate of l' state guarantees appropriate access to marijuana approved and prohibits l' installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around d' a school, a park, d' d' a playground or d' a cr√®che.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It will not n' places more difficult than urban areas to install a licensed trade sale of cannabis, particularly in metropolitan Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a door-floor of the Centre for legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the public prosecutor) would no longer pursue those 21 and older who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop d' charge people for this type of offence "with immediate effect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate l' activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and qu' it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County, in northern Colorado, "District Attorney" (Procureur de la R√©publique), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office would continue to occupy s' business of possession of marijuana, primarily to put pressure on users for renewing qu' detox.</seg>
<seg id="26">To l' moment, 119 persons were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many d' between they object l' d' other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has l' obligation d' prosecute these people who have committed a crime, l' time, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Reactions were complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected l' initiative in favour of restricted consumption of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear d' adults for possession of limited quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The departmental representative public county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to discontinue all cases of detention of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I have not n' l' impression of wasting my time to continue d' apply the law to this jusqu' qu' it changes, "-advantage said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and government suitable for personal consumption of marijuana n' is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"It is a cultural barrier s' d'" with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver representing persons accused of consumption of marijuana and s' expressed as door-floor room "of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for reform laws on marijuana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, too, have-it difficult to accept that this is legal, "-advantage said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to treat restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as l' alcohol, Colorado and Washington State l' are becoming a jurisprudence for the legalisation of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While defenders and representatives of State l' include a new frontier of sales legalized, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which designs always sale and marijuana cultivation as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hoped that the Ministry of Justice provides.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite some arrests profile of patients under marihuana and sellers, the federal government has enabled shops selling marijuana for medicinal purposes d' exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">S' it is true that the police will probably not reinvent the to seize packets of drugs, it is likely it qu' s' against approved shops selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to l' Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Many cities of Colorado n' have not waited for federal authorities to act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Well before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even s' there are s' d' postponement d' a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose the ban next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted for a quelqu' and then find ourselves in a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community has voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are interested in the vote of the community rather qu' to vote l' State.</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions arise.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">As far as I can remember, j' have always dreamed d' enter l' d' Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and my older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a Greek amphitheatre d' of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the freethinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, two weeks after m' be installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, l' j' have decided to make a suitcase, causing the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father has collapsed and s' s' started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper L' argued that j' had left the university because j' had objected that undergraduates have sex in the room next to mine.</seg>
<seg id="9">Author L' A.N. Wilson said that j' was part after being forced to drink in chipped mugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">J' have fled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, j' have fled because j' had been victim d' intimidation and constantly l' bullying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my name rather outrageous or because I had d' a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">J' have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of self-knowledge, saying j' have been victim d' racist behaviour and barbaric: My late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised Margaret Thatcher and j' was a supporter of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why mention this aujourd', me-you.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, recent studies have revealed a new generation qu' d' students of centre-right suffer the same type of persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rising hatred and institutionalized students Tory Oxford is such that last week, some d' them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were "qu' often isolated, attacked personally and feel unwanted" because of their political opinions.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want qu' there is a representative within the Committee on l' l' university for equal opportunities so that their views could be presented freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation n' has been facilitated by the recent documentary aired on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, partner and Right"), dedicated to politics among students, and which depicted the Tories "" as eccentrics and skinheads.</seg>
<seg id="21">It found including l' student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", which uses a Rolls-Royce, complete with a silver and travels with a cane to head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In d' other universities, students Conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the implementation of l' increase tuition fees. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," said in a Sunday newspaper "qu' there is a bias left growing in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history in Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said qu' such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of l' OUCA qu', said there has been a deterioration of l' attitude of members of the JCR to l' people who are centre-right.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates and qu' in well-being-members," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">J' was the only one in the course of my first weeks at Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="28">I walked in September 1986, j' was aged 18 and d' a crippling shyness.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, L' l' university voted refusal d' grant to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a title, because of the reduction of financing higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">L' atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">From the first days of the week d' home, when the new students acquainted with each other and teachers, j' have had a before-taste of what would happen.</seg>
<seg id="33">J' have discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm to students in qu' Tory, but they were having fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">C' was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and opposition l' government l' sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first sarcasm that j' have been victim was a translation into English l' French texts of the 18th century, and I n' was not prepared.</seg>

<seg id="44">At dinner that night, I sat alone then j' have felt a slight tap on my shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">C' was a student in second year d' studies d' English, named James, who s' is presented as a member of l' OUCA.</seg>

<seg id="47">I fear qu' J'.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone suspected d' be a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.</seg>
<seg id="49">C' is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be harder for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the young Tory claim to be of Labour (Labour).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, loosely j' have tried to hide.</seg>
<seg id="52">J' have insisted that I was not n' d' agreement with everything qu' said Mrs Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">This scheme has failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student in first year of Philosophy, Political Science and Economic which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the girl a pig d' fascist."</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students D' resumed the refrain.</seg>
<seg id="57">J' was perverted, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How the Tories are-they l' love?" Asked a l' d' between them.</seg>
<seg id="59">They hit each other, n' is-this? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>

<seg id="64">The next three years would resemble a purgatory d' d' stigma and isolation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, Professor d' modern history, who taught in my university.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was hated not only because he was qu' Conservative, but also because it was qu' foreign policy advisor l' Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="94">But no child under 18 should be victim d' such intimidation in a school.</seg>
<seg id="95">The tragedy is qu' he was s' d' Oxford, who not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also benefits d' an unshakeable reputation d' equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="4">The designer l' acknowledged in l' opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective, which brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house over the past 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"J' love this," said negotiations with his inimitable-Italian accent.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest of the world: Human Kawah Ijen mules</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 kg of sulphur through the steep stone trails.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom work is hell and other d' working literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">C' is the case d' Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living by wearing sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, East l' l' Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">It must work each day jusqu' at the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gases from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with l' air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of almost 70 pounds, he installed in two bamboo baskets qu' it on his shoulders through steep trails.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are only 250 metres jusqu' at the top of the volcano rises to 8,000 metres altitude d' but exhausted carriers are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, a turtle, keeping l' balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know qu' one misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents d' euro for every kilogram of sulphur extract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once, he fought their way between tourists who photograph them as they were s' circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 km jusqu' balance qu' a mining company has installed a bit below to 1,850 metres altitude d'.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is s' TP Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and I can say, its employees, it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 d' euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents d' euro) l' petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks d', cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to launder sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto makes usually three trips per day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Everyone he takes 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but it saves 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, c' is triple that qu' win in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," says a holder who worked as a bricklayer on l' tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">L√†-bas, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and work n' was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur J': "Married a young girl in Bali, where they are Hindus, and I l' have reduced to Java for qu' she converted to Islam l'."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto suffers d' asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">At 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the invoice well qu' he covers the face with a mask and special gloves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto suffers d' asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases emitted by the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">C' qu' is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work even two years because I want to open a shop or study l' promises" Spanish or French-English qu' advantage in a more acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ravaged by life, the boy and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he made the work d' a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">It shares a decayed wood d' dirty with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because sulphur does not emerge at night, when its characteristic blue and yellow becomes shines in the middle of l' darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Defying l' darkness, Anto descends into the crater in s' illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he qu' s' is bought him-even with his own money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 porters load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite its benefits, the mining company has not n' mechanized mining l' sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment holders who work on their own account and are paid in weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, they do not affect a under 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) advance camera, in addition to l' entrance to 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), this natural park wardens charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protest Madrusin, porter, stout 42 years working on Kawah Ijen qu' for 30 years, since he left the college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to carry jusqu' to 110 pounds, it ensures qu' he n' nonstop work as "qu' it can" because it needs to raise money d' 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not retire, I die here because the volcano is all my life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur damages throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap minors in the thick columns of smoke out of the volcano, they are so hard that nobody complains suffer serious diseases... which add s' obviously their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the shoulders, knees and deformed by weight baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only charge 50 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three trucks carry l' Tamansari warehouse, 18 km from there by a sheep trail invaded by weeds.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not retire, I die here because the volcano is all my life," says Unainik opening the mouth, showing several missing teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Older L' of her five children, age 30, also works as holder of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the toughest jobs in the world: That the human mules volcano Kawah ljen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">BBH l' advertising agency to l' origin of the video, hopes to attract l' attention on the problem of fun way through this advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said qu' he wanted to use the power of music for people fill "their national duty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is intended solely to l' Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.</seg>
<seg id="10">He s' is the main problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that c' was a theme that we should address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried several things like launch pheromone fragrances or organize evenings of speed-Executive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were n' creative but they have not necessarily work.</seg>
<seg id="14">We therefore said the following: What more creative to solve this problem that d' a rap song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Government of Singapore is not so lightly.</seg>
<seg id="17">He spends 1,300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more d' children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers gives jusqu' to 15,000 dollars per child, maternity and distributes tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it had little d' effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city-state of high technology and South-East Asia l', also known for conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stood at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time he qu' s' is found in top-2, considered the rate of renewal, c' was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singaporeans have n'-they no longer d' children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, Director of policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says c' is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice d' career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has enabled people to have a wider range d' d' d' options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond-marriage and the constitution d'-a family," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes have contributed to social standards l' increase the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, which has led to a drop in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Between-time d' immigration policy aimed at increasing radically l' immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites who barely disguised xenophobia to l' against the new immigrants, in particular to the Chinese, who are accused of shooting down wages and not integrate s'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Increase L' l' immigration is also seen as a reason why the party in Singapore last year l' has experienced its worst election results since l' independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, they tried to rectify the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth d' a country, tax revenues, health costs and policies d' immigration, l' example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to avoid d' construction of many small houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it started to touch the estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox", can be built in specific areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale enjoyed great success.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the authorities are concerned qu' they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than the largest housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger.</seg>
<seg id="40">For this reason, c' is much more profitable for our cash.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he acknowledges that the new standards provide clearer guidance to proponents, who was previously a spanner in the works s' they wished to propose too small homes in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If these new regulations can be a step towards l' increased national birth rate in discussions with Singaporeans who work in the financial district centre, it seems they qu' n' not having much d' effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, l' c' is why people until later," says a young framework.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Others may have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young d' d' twenty years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women report their careers, stress and the cost of l' access to property and l' education as the reasons that d' having children.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Key Questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, Professor d' English and Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of the social networks is d' inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet has L' emerges as a means to seek information but with l' appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed," said-she.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras said that l' academician Marc Prensky, who has a Masters in Education at l' Yale University and author of the book "Native and digital immigrants", uses these words to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives, they are children and youth who are born with technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital immigrants must teach them, while we-same currently d' learn", said-she.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He adds that the theme is complex, because "we ask d' have a criterion defined on this qu' whether or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they n' not have the maturity to do."</seg>
<seg id="46">"We also call d' be selective so that what matters most is d' be popular, d' have thousands d' friends without thinking about the consequences" she adds-.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert, the most effective way d' teach confidentiality children and adolescents is d' use issues are sobering.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them not to do so does not work," said-she.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then, Porras lists some examples: There are things that you would not be telling a foreigner, why do you-on l' Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you just enjoy it-qu' they publish a photograph of you like d' a friend that you have published?</seg>
<seg id="51">You-know what other publish on you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you see photos, you-applications to other persons permission to identify them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And everyone-negotiations need to know what you do each moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them understand qu' they must act online as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Beyond l' Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and d' other principles, this must be the same on social networks," said-she.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Monitoring</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, Professor d' university, primary school teacher and advisor d' qu' education, says it is essential that parents read conscientiously conditions d' use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">By understanding each terms, they have a solid foundation to discuss with their children implications d' l' opening an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, l' qu' age and it is allowed to share or publish", said-it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children qu' we must not talk to strangers.</seg>

<seg id="5">L' journalists access to information about the summit was constantly limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day, only the video without the sound of l' presidential assembly with the message "closed session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.</seg>
<seg id="7">The little d' information circulating between the journalists were those given by the press officers of some l' Unasur governments attending the go-you, l' exception of door-floor of Peru.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Unique L' document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Later, the President of Peru has sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the s' President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Last October, Peru has been l' 3rd summit host South America-Arab Country (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this has been urged by the press, he had not n' issued the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Pi√±era giving a handshake to President Humala, beside the flags of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Confirmation of the two Presidents qu' they submit to the ICJ held after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogot√° by which it had agreed to comply with the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua qu' she considered seriously flawed.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation of l' (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix to help increase our productive and matrix to envision a better future for our peoples," concluded President Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection l' spaces of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... by pooling our countries and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian President during a speech d'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and were on the crosscutting of its territory, since the coast jusqu' in Brazil, and two for a more important with l' Ecuador well n' qu' he has not given details.</seg>

<seg id="27">Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We hope that the electoral process in that country will reinstatement within l' Union of South American Nations-", which he is currently excluded.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, he defended the project d' establish a citizenship South American-backed by those countries members of l' Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any country n' southern US-c', as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past "-advantage has warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In addition, the Ecuadorian President s' is shown in the reconstitution of l' Organization of American States (OAS) with l' objective to reduce l' influence of States Anglo-Saxons and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San Jos√© on Human Rights l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who bombarded us is never compromise, l' opposite, we, the South-American, l' have all signed.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights l' lies in Washington under the funding of United States-has-advantage," said, alluding to l' political asylum granted by l' Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa ensures qu' he does not regret her decision, because it has not even n'-betrayed its principles, but instead has met its "deep democratic values and rights of l' man."</seg>
<seg id="10">He concluded qu' to l' time, "there was suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, he criticises justice demanded qu' Swedish comply on its territory for questioning on a sexual offence alleged while "the Swedish legislation can do this by videoconference, which could be done since l' l' Embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said qu' there was a risk that the mental and physical health d' Assange deteriorates.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since qu' it lies in our embassy, but l' ambassador m' informed qu' he had a small lung condition, but nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact d' be confined in a small space without make d' exercises to l' open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It affects the health of n' anyone," concludes-it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa noted that the solution d' asylum granted to Assange since June in l' Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be l' allocation d' a except-led that would allow her to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Grande-Bretagne, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he stressed qu' he had discussions in London to find a solution to l' confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with the Human Rights l' n', we use this word in this case, but there has been ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Grande-Bretagne, Sweden and European judicial authorities because l' lawyer d' Assange, Baltazar Garz√≥n, has launched a series of proceedings from different European bodies, "-advantage said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">And he thinks that "if the Grande-Bretagne the except-led tomorrow, it would end".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Correa has the opportunity to reassert themselves as a defender of freedom of the press and he noted that this qu' there was "not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that hinder freedom d' expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians but malicious or perverse bad journalists in the pay of l' greed, blackmail and extortion l'-advantage," said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this perspective, it s' welcomed this is not the kind of journalists "or the bankers and the hegemonic countries and bourgeois who dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his reelection, "it deepen the revolution to pursue the road and track".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within l' Unasur at least jusqu' in the upcoming elections, arguing that l' body "should be firm and not tolerate l' opportunism and attempts to blow d' State disguised", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Moreover, President of Ecuador considers "relevant" the desire to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment, the judgement n' is not respected.</seg>

<seg id="29">We must solve them together to overcome them and move l' before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the same time, he s' is confident in the resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime boundaries between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said it is "qu' beneficial as l' Latin America seize international forums if the two countries s' agreed to accept a judgment if farm qu' it is."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Referring to l' event presentation as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he reported qu' he saw this possibility "with great d' optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa has ensured that he lost s' primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">At a personal level, power m' has never interested, but in situations as unfair than l' Ecuador, poverty-more economic cannot be solved only through the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement believed c' was me guaranteeing this potential victory but we must accept this responsibility, "-advantage said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.</seg>

<seg id="37">"C' is my decision, "-advantage said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch√°vez, in Cuba.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deaths due to AIDS are now aujourd' due to late detection.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old lorsqu' he confirmed the result of the test: Infected.</seg>
<seg id="3">"C' is as if the sky m' fell on the head," said-it by referring to the time of l' announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less onerous", in vain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man l' hid his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take one of his illness and began s' inform about him and his determination has been such qu' he recently celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients l' unit of HIV l' civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he s' is found in 1994 after many battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio l' living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, the clinic director d' l' IMSS avoided to say goodbye qu' "because he was speechless."</seg>
<seg id="9">In this time-there, having AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aujourd' today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and d' have a good quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignoring their disease, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims d' opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after l' appearance of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory that survival is aujourd' d' a patient started treatment with timely and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of unit l' HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes to reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">L' infectiologue and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS n' was more a deadly disease, but that the number d' years of survival and quality of life depended on the level assignment d' immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those zero drugs: Jusqu' 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and jusqu' 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Put simply, this means that for a quelqu' receiving a diagnosis HIV positive for 25 years, "both qu' it will remain under control, can live without problems jusqu' 75 years," explained the scientist interrogated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To put this in context, it is important to know that l' life expectancy of Mexican is now aujourd' 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is true that S' mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report d' UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since l' appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients reported on the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nothing qu' in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 dead jusqu' in May this year; however, we are assured that l' access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So why do-it-wording of death?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">I think the problem is not l' access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">C' is as I see it, c' s' is what happened in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">Over the past 12 years at least, we n' have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage qu' because they do not know they are infected, or they l' learn to advanced stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patients on ten came qu' they already have an opportunistic infection, this qu' it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, c' is earlier diagnosis, and this must propose testing, to anyone who requests it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Specialists and Council members d' State AIDS prevention of Jalisco (s' Coesida) on its proposal, as well as patients them-same as Fabrizio, who has done its testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend qu' l' did and that, despite his age, he was already holder of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is a common l' complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some believe qu' they will die and do not want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I die, it is better than I m' erupted three times a week," say they-n', this is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am l' exercise, I take my medication.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, his parents know only qu' he suffers d' cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">J' have a normal life, as anyone d' n'.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, j' have much d' activities, I travel, j' have sexually active, but responsibility, I pay attention to me and l' person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with JALISCO ARE GROWING. To help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid, aujourd' during the march of the World Day against AIDS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Qu' they make the test s' they took risks, the more they will soon s' they are HIV positive and better, and they have already s' diagnosis requires l' qu' they know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms on the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest lies in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In all places dedicated to this, "it has increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we have packages of 100, c' is very well, but as a result, qu' aujourd' n' even today, some have no access to condoms," says-.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The question: "Is Qu'-what you do?", with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors d', pharmacists and other health professionals, is the question that adolescents are unwilling n' d' hear, the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="39">It proposes to reorient this distribution ineffective; that condoms are not only sold, but qu' counters are located in distributors public washrooms and in the places where young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not s' d' encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is s' no pay girls and the motel, as had told the governor Emilio Gonzalez lorsqu' he had asked s' there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not as n' works sexuality, it is best to provide condoms to those already sexually active-advantage," said.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A judgment ratified on appeal by a court of United States-ignores debt restructuring of the group Vitro provided via a bankrupt business in Mexico. The scenario is a harmful precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the Stars and Stripes, opposite view of international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">D' a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment of 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the embargo d' beyond-their properties in the Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution is the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to the Supreme Court of the United States-based on three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First D', while the judge of the case said that Creditors s' register according to the Bankruptcy Law-United States, the court d' appeal for the Fifth Circuit, sitting at the Nouvelle-Orl√©ans, contends that the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in cases d' insolvency d' companies with a profile transnational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, the United Nations Model for l' Consistency of International Commercial Law had been established for this purpose by taking l' American Law Institute as arbitrator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgement stated that without the intercorporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring n' l' could not be obtained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, the case of Vitro n' is not the first to use this plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here there is a half-dozen d' examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including l' Federal Institute of Bankruptcy Commerciales had guaranteed debts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, what is certain is that puisqu' votes remained subsidiaries, all the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, c'-is-including as "vulture funds" Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, n' had not obtained the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote was 45 votes to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A given omitted by the court d' appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">D' another side, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation qu' he met since 2008 without s' stop to the serious economic crisis faced qu' Member-States, passing the costs to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For now, the company l' family Gonz√°lez Sada file an appeal before the same court d' appeal for the vote in its entirety, c' is to say with the five judges, as only three had voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Recourse d' insurance claim the not-prosperity and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United-States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of l' amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which detail the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, noting that the freed conventions signed by both countries for the set at the same level as l' paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Law Member-States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, he pointed out that the country is s' complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, c' is-including the rules for transborder d' insolvency cases, which guarantee l' equity for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Pileup of two parts: They overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.</seg>

<seg id="1">H√©ctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball-Ball is my entire life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The globe-basketball-owned Ball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, through him, has travelled around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of l' history of basketball-Ball as large as the local d' H√©ctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The reason is qu' before qu' cerebral hemorrhage did condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player, league player l' national team basketball, manager and leader of l' national team, the NSO, with Vaqueros of Bayam√≥n or as chairman of the federation of basketball-Ball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"J' have brought several hats in basketball-Ball throughout my life, and even many simultaneously, as when j' was chairman of the NSO, Director General of l' national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to d' Primera Hora home to Bayam√≥n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball-Ball is all my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes n' not exaggerate when he made this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary, evidenced by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayam√≥n in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all his memories, those qu' he favours the most are those who remind her of her passage as player within l' vaqueros team in the mid 1950s jusqu' in 1982, after 15 years as a co-manager or l' team manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"This was my best years, those who have benefited most from j' because j' have had the chance to participate in eight championships vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is many years d' satisfaction, including the five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">I then removed during the championship in 1981, when l' Jerome Mincy entered l' OBS team.</seg>
<seg id="14">From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of l' team, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, who was here and leader who was at l' University d' Alabama (Birmingham), m' said: "J' have a hefty player for you, two metres.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want? "</seg>
<seg id="17">C' is as qu' starting Mincy, one of the best players qu' was Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow m' then recommended Raymond Gausse, who had been naturalized and who was a better marksmen.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember qu' he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship Gausse would help us try d' in win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">He is pleased s' championship with Gausse vaqueros, but only remotely puisqu' in 1988 he was already the czar of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this time-there, he preferred to take advantage of its charges and Mincy in l' national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we l' have won for the first time to United States-pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there was the Mondial de 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we would have to win the bronze medal Canadian judge if we had not play the last game, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Team L' Mondial de 1990 is-it the best national team that you view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is part of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favourite is the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won l' gold and we have taken a beating in l'-United States team, which was quite similar to those who won bronze at the Mondial.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team n' was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and "Picul√≠n" (Ortiz), there were also youth (Javier) "To√±ito" Col√≥n and James Carter, the brothers Le√≥n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote n'" Morales, who had been unable to attend the Global 90 because d' a knee problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that can be-n' was not the best in terms d' individuals, but it gave us a medal d' gold and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuqu√©n in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in lieu of players suspended by l' imbroglio Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold l' against all predictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Undoubtedly, it is s' Picul√≠n Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Person to Puerto Rico n' dominated at this level as l' made Picul√≠n.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">That was the best Puerto Rican leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">C' is very difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the young, j' love the work of Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having part of l' time the most glorious of l' national team between 1988 and 1995, and qu' in the early 1990s, the NSO had jusqu' 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">You rest-advantage to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that j' wanted to implement, like the regionalization of minor categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example that boys Ponce play only in their area and only teams other corners of l' island in the play-offs.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Aujourd' travelling and play too while this n' is not necessarily required.</seg>
<seg id="45">J' have at least seen l' advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, the field staff and arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="46">It makes me happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you aujourd'-?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In general, j' listen to music, I watch my clips on YouTube, I take my small-children and, from time to time, j' attended games of basketball-Ball.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been at my side.</seg>

<seg id="1">Death of l' actor Larry Hagman</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, Forth Worth, Texas, s' is worldwide known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he embodied a man d' business unscrupulous daunting and manipulative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of l' greed in the 1980s, died.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was 81.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night complications d' cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., production of "Dallas".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role ironic qu' he loved the most," said the family.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family of Larry and his friends were with him in Dallas in this Thanksgiving holiday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman lorsqu' he died at a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He brought joy to all those who knew him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and we will greatly miss.</seg>
<seg id="11">"C' was a person d' exception and he lived life to bottom," Gray said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Doctors had diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted much drink for many years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 1995, she had detected a malignancy and he had undergone liver transplantation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Several years before "Dallas," Hagman s' was known to television in the role d' an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.</seg>
<seg id="15">One-in, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed lorsqu' he discovered a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and qu' it back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He also played in two comedy remained shortly to l' antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).</seg>
<seg id="17">Among his film credits include roles well received by criticism in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">But it was through his masterful interpretation of deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.</seg>
<seg id="19">The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been disseminated d' April 1978 in May 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", invented to maintain suspense around d' an episode full d' emotions in which the character d' Hagman is almost assassinated, generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in bets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thanks to this, inter alia, the series has reached a record d' hearing at that time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average before their screen and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in the world, after l' final episode of "MASH" in 1983, who had gathered 50 million viewers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">C' was the beautiful sister-J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who was shot.</seg>
<seg id="24">J.R. l' was pregnant and had l' then threatened with l' accused of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but d' others had also reasons of l' attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Hagman played Ewing as a man role d' corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smile: A contractor dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to place his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I know this should be qu' as epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="27">We should write: "Ci-lies l' honest citizen J.R. Ewing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This unique l' part qu' he lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste from the original series, s' recalled this Friday d' d' Hagman as a "huge, both on the small screen as in life."</seg>
<seg id="30">It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world and in the heart of each d' us, who have had the chance to know and love l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months with great success on TNT.</seg>
<seg id="32">L' recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">For l' moment, nor the Warner nor the chain TNT n' provided on how the death d' Hagman will be integrated in the series.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of l' actress and singer Mary Martin, who met fame with such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".</seg>
<seg id="35">Mary Martin was still a teenager lorsqu' she gave him the day in 1931 when qu' she was married to l' lawyer Ben Hagman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">He made his first steps on the scenes of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">C' is low-qu' he met the young Swedish interior decorator d' Maj Axelsson and he qu' l' married.</seg>
<seg id="38">The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Submissions unforgiving of J.R)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"I have nothing n' written in this book that could injure a quelqu' l' affect or in any way whatsoever, "-advantage told the press at the time-there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of donation d' bodies and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients concerned.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">A course on the "end of the world" is to begin</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes as nuclear war, the cyber viruses and germs and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when Professor religion Stuart charmed decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he was a hook qu' irresistible: The end of the "countdown" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which many people refer to as proof of the impending doom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Professor charmed n' had no idea what l' expected during the months: L' catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a chasm that some have dubbed "Armageddon" l' debt and growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists to the end of time thought occurs l' apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not realize that it would be half the more apocalyptic n' that I have ever seen," said this week Professor charmed her students University l' Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="6">If you look at what happened in the world s' aujourd' as if we were 30 days later and the already, this was a very good time.</seg>
<seg id="7">And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in l' apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the only n' professor to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, who will, in theory, the last of l' history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Temple, the Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the "Media, Culture and end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes as nuclear war, the cyber viruses and germs and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze this because these ideas proliferated over time," said-advantage, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear weapons l' fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month ,-students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"J' have tried d' inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State d' ', Professor d' History d' Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art and History d' l' d' Anthropology, have teamed up to provide a course, simply titled "The end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not would disappear," said Professor Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "disaster", students must study, create projects and spend their final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In l' State of Pennsylvania, l' final review will be spent on the eve of l' Apocalypse, which does not leave students d' choice but to work "jusqu' on the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses have proved quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for students, composed of 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from persons requesting s' there was still the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do for comfort," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and Sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, l' University of Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because the fear of l' Apocalypse, qu' it is secular and religious, is only a question of comfort, or d' lack of comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and 25 years, says previewing all films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I had never heard n' d' a course which taught the has-advantage," said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I appreciate l'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no students surveyed, let alone a teacher, we believed in the end date of the world of 21 December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and d' a way we l' have discredited," says Julie student zegle last year at Temple, aged 21, from West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya n' have never predicted the end of the world, it is only s' d' a key date on the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But I admit there are qu' anxiety related to l' apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">Internet L' has led to a boom in speculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In d' other places, people don ‚Äô t think about this, "-.</seg>
<seg id="34">He s' majority in the Anglophone world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of l' University La Salle who lectured the Philippines this year, responded quickly lorsqu' asked s' he knew qu' here given courses on the "end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", we-it-wording replied, as he s' s' d' d' was an exception from a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a grace of the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall noted qu' over the years, we talked about the many supposedly dates of Judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophise about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning d' a period of 7 years at the end of the world will disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers take the date lightly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several told us they thought qu' go to parties "the end of the world".</seg>
