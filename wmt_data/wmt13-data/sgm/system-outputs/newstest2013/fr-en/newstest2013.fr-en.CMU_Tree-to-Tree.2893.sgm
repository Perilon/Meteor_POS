<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter as a myth, stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, Republican lawyers have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will in part of the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organization of the United States federal elections.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making more difficult the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections that saw it add new Republican officials in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the single year of 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws reduce also the periods of advance polls, the right to register as a voter polling day and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with judicial record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state did voters to present a photo identification card.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Indiana was the first State to ask such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of the Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities clamoured to extend this practice to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to require voters to present a photo identification card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens have not of universal ID cards like health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by an agency of the government of their State.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 to lack such identification.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, it is often more than $100 to obtain the required ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and persons with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In effect, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID with photo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Although most.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students, voters considered voting more for Democrats, candidates are not permitted in a number of States to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, these same States permit fishing or hunting clubs who vote more members of Republicans for using voting cards issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures clearly limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it appears that two in three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on polling day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not inconsequential.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have helped to save approximately 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced significantly the rate of 17 per cent registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, at the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of electors who voted at the advance polls were African Americans, whereas they represented only 13% of state voters.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the same with Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">They accounted for 11 per cent of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted at advance polls.</seg>
<seg id="41">In return, whites made up 76% of voters accounted for 46% of electors voting at advance polls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly objected to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic Governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The General Counsel of the United States intervened to suspend most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They could limit the damage in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photo.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Democrat criticism decry the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see a clear intent to influence the results in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre demonstrates that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will in part of the American democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening for prostate cancer: the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In effect, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results with false negative or false positive, which cause unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">To test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this one European, found a difference of mortality among patients who have had a screening and those who did not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastasized if it is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="9">I would recommend the test from the age of 50, or over 40 years of age if it has a parent who has had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">African-American men are also more at risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make the right decision once cancer was detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">It and other aggressive cancers are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">It really understanding the degree of risk to the patient of his cancer, offering potential options, not necessarily prostate cancers that do not to life in the long term, and instead, in such cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who detected the cancer will not be addressed, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will suggest to active monitoring and if the disease progresses, it will provide a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, with the precision of the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I would recommend it to the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But what's important is to have a discussion with his physician to determine if it should pass or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that is designed to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is unfortunately not magic recipe for preventing cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best means to reduce risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">An estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30 percent of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody smoked, this rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, estimated that about 10 per cent of cancers are caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several also remains totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society, the tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cigarette is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This greatly affects the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Data: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of a cancer halved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Overweight and obesity also favor the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum, cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that the regular practice of a lifetime physical activity protects against colon cancer," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, it increased the risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Low-fat luncheon meats, and should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat by smoking, curing or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their research is not conclusive for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one found a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather than an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D on the cancer is not clearly established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed on the importance of talk of its concerns and its family history with her doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">'' Skip a screening test, it does not cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson décortiqué</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">thought that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the universe, no less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter -- but that has not yet been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But to physicists, it is not yet entirely sure whether the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">knows without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and that it closely resembles Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data released this week at a congress of physical, to Kyoto, seem to confirm, but still lack of data to be perfectly clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Assume all the same whether the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong appear slim, and see what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There has, in this world, a law necessarily inevitable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">No way of breaking this rule -- and don't try too hard, you'll hurt you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Or even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it is that she, too, this kind of legislation: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" -- that "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">From there, particle physicists are in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, there is good citizens appointed fermions, wisely obey the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in another wave of bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually find themselves in the same place, same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary,) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: meson, that we will not here, and "particulate matter", by which the spread of the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson would in some way related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons-là, it must be emphasized here, are not all too exotic creatures than you might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary ordinariness: the photon, or particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When, in effect, a particle with an electrical charge, accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this location, a bit like launched a pebble in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disruption" is an electromagnetic wave (of the light, or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.) and this is nothing other than a photon -- and therefore, a boson "carriers".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Field more stable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It goes well with the Higgs boson, that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" to appear this boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for him, is very, very high energies, a little as if it was a frozen pond in which only a very large rock could ride the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is therefore a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km circumference! -- to achieve such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the report and the mass of the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is indeed not all particles, or all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, but others are not -- a piece of paper, for example, will never of himself on a fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, me) have not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what that "can make "all this research, ask Senator Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM) and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between observations and predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are many hoped fervently that, because the slightest bit of difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes of the Model.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But such differences to CERN was not found until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The implications of this research in the daily life of the man and woman the average Joe, they are more difficult to predict, but we would assume that there will not.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Bell Laboratories, had no revolution that their work would trigger.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, we had already said the late physicist Willard Boyle -- who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has developed the first laser continuous (first were pulsed) in 1962 -- initially the laser was seen as a "gadget lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And then, applications also can come from any instrumentation research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during the course of its work in perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though this was not the original intention, is now "eye" to all digital cameras of the world, and won the Nobel physics 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does of course not to say that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know ...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative Care -- The best way to die ... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With its Commission to die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should resume shortly then prepares a draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this critical area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has attempted to look more closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in her apartment in the Montérégie region.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cancer of the prostate that gnawed him a break of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years", he said, mixed, lying in his bed at the hospice Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, it may not be prepared to it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease made her work: a huge weakness which go only to the bathroom, and even eating alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attablé before an appetising breakfast, he agreed to help to eat, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brave, even to smile, spoke to strangers who are around him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of regular death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that it cured me of diarrhoea, it is humiliating," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team has found a solution to this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man, it pissed standing", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Régresser at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept the regression, he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">For, in the view of many people working in palliative care, moments take place in the heart of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a prognosis of maximum life of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage," the team of doctors and nurses that surrounds them provides no more so-called curative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is of dying "conscious and stifled".</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease made me discover my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children," she added.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have wishes in life," she says, before accepting that he presents a mask to help her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is still, in the next few days, a last visit of her son from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At Victor-Gadbois, it provides, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.</seg>
<seg id="29">What is palliative care, given when no nothing else to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the deaths more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, a palliative care bed for 11 700 people.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's very little when that all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In dying, it will provide mouth care in brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.</seg>
<seg id="36">People with diabetes will no longer control their blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, died during the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, it is his son until the beer to the feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It helps relatives as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At home Victor-Gadbois days follow but are not the same.</seg>
<seg id="42">alongside an old man of 93 years which enjoyed its last gathering of family in the courtyard, although stalled in its pillows while on rap in his honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded of his parents, his wife and their two young children, after any attempted to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, there still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois arrive from their home, 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">said that 77% of Canadians have simply not access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to ease the pain when a patient is reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, more or less exclusively specialize in the care offered to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely this deficiency in Quebec health care that concern to several palliative care physicians the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed palliative care experts including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, traveling to show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone shall be entitled to quality end-of-life care before it agrees to carry out euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I saw a patient from 14 days to the emergency, in great pain, without that it is necessary to alleviate poverty.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients are dying because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists scrambling on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.</seg>
<seg id="54">The survival hopes of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I announced to my oncologist that the treatment, she said that she regretted that I shall fight, she was told.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she told me that I was finished!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believed that 90% of patients who request to die thank the caregivers have not acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But many say that palliative care are not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, the patients would be refractory to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which is to sedate the patient until the time of his death, or sporadically, permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">You can not pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily say "I want that you euthanasiiez" it means "I want to be relieved."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Officials of the road, construction contractors, political fundraisers and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day in and day out what they know of a great "system", with the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.</seg>
<seg id="3">A "industry" at great cost to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is curious as the system was being eroded since major step was taken," quips Jacques Duchesneau, MP and former Chief of Police of Montreal in Quebec City.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is that the scandal has erupted in 2011, by means of a survey on fraud related to contracts of road work in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had made it backwards.</seg>

<seg id="17">He has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal through a linked to the mafia who reversait money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Zambito has cast to the wind in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about € 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials said the road could grease the leg in inflating invoices from 30% to 40%, by false extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then a Mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay deliberately closed eyes on a parallel budget into its coffers with dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.</seg>

<seg id="35">Believing to 70 per cent share of dirty money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this was a pale reflection of the reality."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">"The MTP is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season, you have taken a new dimension with the MTP.</seg>
<seg id="3">Why that progression?</seg>
<seg id="4">It may explain by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the MTP.</seg>
<seg id="5">Major players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I progressed to their side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also contributed a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a daily basis, these factors lead me to raise my level of play.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, in the match, it is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is moving very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not ignite.</seg>
<seg id="12">In my early days at the center of the INF pre-training Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I always advanced by levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You therefore use competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti ...</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruits this summer are accustomed to compete in games of a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every day is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a player like me want to respond and provide the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is assisted by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the man?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and part of the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was a great experience and has earned many titles with exclusive clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think they will win the other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a discussion with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I then went out of a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has placed in me also says my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How do you on the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In Ligue 1, Lyon, we took the top spot.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the final with the way the 8th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">It will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But will our word to say against very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish top of Pool, before Porto, to receive during the 8th of the final return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">It already has the budget ...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the period.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, the GMP provides the means for this project come to fruition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In Ligue 1, not to win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would represent a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, it has really pocket this title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season, it is not far off.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualifications to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It has made a very big season.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has finished with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be the champion ...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, has an even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think that it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are to the fight for the title, I think that it has the weapons to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you expect the media too of the MTP?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that expected a lot of us in the light of what has been invested and players that was.</seg>
<seg id="56">It accepts completely.</seg>
<seg id="57">After, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and found still to blame us, it is sure that it is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">It wondered what people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">It can never win 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">It is trying to build a project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">It has proved that it could meet in the Champions League.</seg>
<seg id="64">Take Manchester City that does not happen, the last two seasons, to qualify for the 8th of final, they have also made huge expenses!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In light of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points to the truce.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been "turbo-charged" by this new MTP.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we have the smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The GMP appears totally dependent of the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Both better said that there was a "Zlatan dependence."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It is ripe for it and it proves that it is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">It has shown wherever it is that it was a great player, a global star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the group, Human Rights and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also meets men he has around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did was truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This prompts the other to raise their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also to the entire world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you lived in Euro 2012 with France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I had to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things there and I am out strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I arrive to make good matches in selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">That is what I had hoped since my baptism with the Blues.</seg>
<seg id="87">It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and it needs to have an exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">How do you on the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the Blues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The results for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World.</seg>
<seg id="91">The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.</seg>
<seg id="92">As Laurent Blanc was.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't do comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved its goal in us qualifying for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps lead the Blues to Brazil.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="96">The good (1-1) out on 16 October, in Spain he is founding a match?</seg>

<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the opposite of current monetary exchange, based on identified transactions of central banks, and the costs of treatment among stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, euros) and a protocol to the secure exchange of BitTorrent, which enables peer-to-peer file sharing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200,000 transactions have been registered through to 15 000 computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">A small 1,000 of Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course of bitcoin, after having reached a peak of $30 (€ 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen $( courses are identified on the site bitcoincharts. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing of very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a virtual currencies report published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">She described bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is other types of virtual currency as "credits", used to make progress in a video game that wins in playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, each time, a central authority control and trafficking trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, money transmitters, and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is really between two e-mail addresses to the way in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except that a user can select a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of double encryption key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and won, so interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of hash file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique digital footprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers are "the new transaction and it added a number before "chop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number which gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once found this number, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to defraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very fast (less than 10 minutes, one of the two transactions would be validated by the network -- other orphaned because both have different fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer resolved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until 100 millionth, which leaves the margin ...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the challenge is also up to each increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network's life has had ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">A number of websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in deposits stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The flaw used not the protocol itself", Pierre Noizat, just launch Paymium, a company of payment in real money using the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also anonymous possibilities of money laundering through this service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash also has this defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins are not moving.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, giant balances" have been launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book teaching on this currency, believed in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are less expensive.</seg>
<seg id="45">The holder manages over its identity and can therefore be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement merchants, who did not need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is sufficient to provide an address that can "phone photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take time for that Bitcoin is necessary, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB, in its report, is a reassessment of the risks, today considered high, in the case of the success of this currency.</seg>

<seg id="4">NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time that the Afghan army takes possession of its territory and that Afghans decide their future, without any wait for us.</seg>
<seg id="6">This mainly Afghan farmers that we punished them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, maimed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as the time of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by Pakistani jihadists,, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolérés, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will not when Westerners are more discrete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The departure of French troops from the base of the Kohi, that I have noted the high hills planted almond thanks to French credits, was in the order.</seg>
<seg id="12">The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles have joined the Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taliban onslaught on Kabul will not be available as early as the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, the country and the struggle between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their control of the country had been seen as a kind of release, a return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of the farmers, overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They became in business class, seizing government land for resale in the land of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, with "huge U.S. contracts of subcontracting.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are fisherman; most of them have not fought themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard in campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to quit, as will those who take advantage of American largesse: capital flight is huge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="26">Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now of 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the cities, government schools are full of girls as boys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will provide labor to these young people who will not return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.</seg>

<seg id="31">The authorities ordered which will be considered as legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">Some former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already rebuilding provincial militia, which escape to the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, country of mountains, to strong local identities, should enjoy some decentralization, to the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted the transformer in a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister which existed since the 1964 Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai is not foreign controls, especially during elections scheduled for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country is, since the 1950s and before, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">No industry has not been filed, no dam is in the state, no major system of irrigation is not repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is left to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">This has only added to the sense that Westerners n" were there to capture it.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to process copper or iron ore on the spot, or means of transport for export through the mountains, no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have already left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It will eventually also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relationship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The departure of French troops was completed on November 20.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, the French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support to the Archaeological Delegation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">since 2009, to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive action, a service "civil-military" actions of the Department of Defense (Cimic) deleted in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGOs, many agricultural work and rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.</seg>
<seg id="48">This work, gourmands in main-d ' local, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, sinks, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase cultivable areas.</seg>

<seg id="12">For the President, it is also a way to find a popular legitimacy and democratic while the dispute raged throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for it, as he stated in an interview to the weekly U.S. Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">In that appeal to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I take full powers", they allegedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, to the Islamist majority, have voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The most liberals were missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Come mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, do not have to give their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or of civil society in had done the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order that the quorum is reached, 11 persons of alternate members, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close of the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators have also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day is around ... the hour of prayer, some members of the Committee on the grounds that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was improperly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was still being "d" to be voted on yesterday evening, 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Objects of all attentions, identical to that of the Constitution Article 2 remains at the end of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" by "rules", which would permit a more strict application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and their respect of other components of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy," are liberals, who see that a communication.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the Islamization of the Constitution, according to them, is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They include article 220, which gives an advisory role to Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to check the conformity of laws with the sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist Sophie Pommier, Egypt is worrying because "people called a decision are not elected and not have any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the beginnings of a theocracy."</seg>
<seg id="32">The liberals ' fears were further fuelled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the time being, no concrete religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, it remains in the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most jurists who have worked on this text are not the scholars but academics, some trained in the French system" moderates Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he recognizes that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, as religious terms from vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">It refers to "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence, ed).</seg>
<seg id="38">And the issue could arise in the future of the extent of civilian judges are competent to decide upon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of expanded powers it gives to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they are significantly reduced in comparison of what they were under the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: powers to the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">Pursuant to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a Council of National Defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">No more that are not prohibited the trial of civilians in military courts, the human rights defense associations.</seg>
<seg id="44">These are also part of their concerns about the text, that they consider freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy and insult is maintained is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, of the press in particular.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, any article is no longer echo to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President should speak yesterday evening to the TV, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The support of the Head of State marching them, on Saturday.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="7">For the moment, this Rule only those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, with time, promises the federal migration service, tests become mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and of legal bases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It will need to validate their knowledge of languages in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">It exempts only the nationals of countries where the Russian has the status of official language.</seg>

<seg id="15">Immigrants can take examinations in cities across the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This initiative to introduce reviews has been supported by Deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Service of Migration.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, before the Act comes into force, human rights defenders have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: that is that it will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What is the obligation of the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, to meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people with "slave labor".</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of defense of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service of Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of rights must begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organized selection will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not speak the language and who do not have medical certificates.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev migrant, the future is designed to cross dishonest people who, under pretext of the assist, to provide a "trip" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of its similar to agonise for months without food and without paper and will have between 12 and 14 hours a day.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">While the world is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities trying to resolve the problem in "tightening the screws."</seg>

<seg id="23">Many of these have often suffered explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"certified versions indicate that some fires were triggered intentionally to conceal the deficit," says the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">For Baranets, arms manufacturers are there for something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"It sees private weapons plants compete not only with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," an expert says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One of the other sources of black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A significant share of pistols and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It sometimes small-scale local production, a mafia and organizes the supply," added the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where are the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on the issue has been established in 2011 analysis of problems and study by the Centre for Public Administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and portals of public data relating to weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, from the army and security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of these weapons on the black market if it is found by lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons", it was suggested in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17 per cent from 14 per cent of places of military conflicts, are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine excavations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A salesperson and consultant of a gun who requested anonymity ensures that long since anyone can buy weapons found by these specialists of the illegal search; they are too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The more often, according to him, sellers will seek new military goods in warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="39">The person buys a unit through a sign, for example a TT pistol.</seg>

<seg id="1">United States: employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nearly a quarter of American teenagers spend by a cashier at McDonald 's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the time being, one can not predict whether this wave will grow or fade quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These actions are supported by a number of associations and unions of the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time modest wage increases that wage earners in Walmart basis and fast food chains, events organisers wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This sector is not yet covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a rain pounding of seizing balances of millions of people descended on the America and sometimes of outbursts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On that day, some employees of the company Wal-Mart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, have left their post to picket with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of small and medium-sized classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything: diapers to hunting rifles from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products are on average 8 per cent to 27 per cent cheaper than the major supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many of low-paid employees at Walmart shop solely on their place of work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and product choices have made one of the most powerful groups of Walmart U.S..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap, inter alia because of low wages of its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain of difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the events of "Black Friday" for salary increases, they complained of the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 $per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the basic employee at Walmart that receives $9.5 of the hour, it is a sum that it can not afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists of the University of California Berkeley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary of $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is 1.1% of more of what it spends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart transferred all of the increase of salaries on the shoulders of consumers, would each race in the store to 46 cents.</seg>
<seg id="22">They spend $12.39 in only one year of more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and have not brought any harm to the group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" has continued in the evening from 8 am to midnight the following day and Walmart stores sold 5,000 articles on this period to the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its funds have made 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The spokesperson Dan Fogleman has left site in an interview with the Huffington Post that "fewer than five employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a "communication among many" by the union organizer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Customer following!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York and were not more progressive Walmart stores in this city, they are not very popular, it is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's announces sell billion servings and after they are not even sick leave and pay you not the work you've done honestly!</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage provided for by the federal legislation and that of New York is $7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fast increase with time, but of little, average its employees basic affect New York $8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is no less than in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For me it is not possible to live with that amount to New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It was a time where almost a quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald's after the school while living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with that salary and sometimes to feed their children with.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, Wall Street Journal found comments on the forum of newspaper saying that it is irresponsible to children if you don't know with what you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The demonstrators that have launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 on McDonald's near the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, required that cashiers and the fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 per hour, or an increase of more than two times that the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also sought to ensure that the establishment of trade unions in the sector of fast food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The U.S. law prohibits impeding administration and punish a union protesters by bullying or redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, the administration rarely simplifies life.</seg>
<seg id="43">For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The major one is the special staff rotation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They are not agree</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other tumultuous events took place near several other fast-food chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the protest has been the rally in the middle of the day near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, City Council member, who said: "McDonald's announces sell billion servings and after they are not even sick leave and do not pay the work you've done honestly!".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate to the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must all support the employees in fast food to obtain a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The New York Times has characterized the event as the more important that the fast food sector in its entire history.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people attended from all were not employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is currently difficult to say if this will spark a mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For the moment, that moderate to fool the brain"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Lately, fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Initially, it is that Google unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it has learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the interview with the group's director of interactive 3D technology from the laboratory Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of this society, the glasses are already history.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by the creation of open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Could you tell us in a few words that made your group of research?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are working on the interaction between human and machine and we at the same time expand the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The humanity as a whole remained flat for the time being to pixels on screen and sometimes in touch.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to see 5 to 10 years before we guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and almost no Xbox Kinect without today doesn't sell because everybody looks to the order by the gesture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things are on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data) but the performance, for the moment, not really.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change that and we are working on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technology projection.</seg>
<seg id="15">It must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it must not only identify the user, but also the surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a form more convenient.</seg>
<seg id="18">And to begin with, we get rid of those silly virtual reality helmets!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think of voice commands?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is appreciated, but is not overestimated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It can not say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because you didn't always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for ordering the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to action, not broad gestures, but rather to discrete, limited gestures.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a bracelet worn to the hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fact, the future will be marked by the joint control, for example: gesture + votes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">That is to say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how would you me this can get you?</seg>
<seg id="29">You do with speech and actions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Usually, I spoke only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">-- So, you want to force users to adapt in terms of what the machine can or can not do at any given time?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I believe that very soon we will need to work to the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.</seg>
<seg id="35">These may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- Looking to your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, it is that you do not like in the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">They lack of resolution, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">It would of course obtain approximately 8 megapixels with a speed of 1,000 c/s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the problem is not the cameras themselves, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.</seg>
<seg id="41">Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds of the designers work algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must keep to the spirit of the resolution by X and Y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed is important, also, the number of executives at the second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movements are aggressive enough, and 30 (c/s not enough really, especially for actions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond has given to the touch sensors a delay scheduled of treatment between 1 and 100 µs, current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Everyone does not influence how the interaction of human and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">I need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touching, to have more executives to the second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">But should not increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is in fact a usual sensor of the field visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not to define the depth of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">Many cameras could solve this problem ...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of cameras and to see how it could help to define the locations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I recall, Microsoft, Google, has not submitted his glasses in public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, sunglasses are one of the platforms with the most promising?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, walk around all the time with a smartphone hands is not practical but what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that you would from a cloud computing platform to smartphone glasses.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a very personal and it is that their (personal elements are those that you're the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is an issue on which the opponents to this point the finger: no tactile sensation!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepare compared to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my classes, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the time being, the interesting techniques is the use of second hand for support of image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It captures perfectly the pressure!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there also technologies which are actually intended to award the palpabilité to these images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound led to a point where the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breath of air on the tips of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="68">There also bracelets worn on wrists which affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also introducing a line of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- And you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Him to believe that it feels that it should normally feel when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, we have not tried yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">There was still a task là-dessous on which it will come to the wrong: how to suggest to someone who is physically located in a very limited space that he is walking in an open space almost infinite -- we are working on concepts of treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs) mobile platforms and also of giant balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">For the moment, that moderate to fool the brain, it is still many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="74">This makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still to the absolute rule of fertilization.</seg>

<seg id="3">This list ultra-sélective has already hosted prominent players of the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements beyond the border of the city and were a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the painter extraverti Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Any Kirill Miller knows the city, rather than bearded man, dressed all in red that can cross the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or at parties and openings connected.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tables of Kirill Miller still bring crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a fundamentally social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, one of the founding of new myths.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and good humor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has recently taken an organ grinder in his hands and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since it was ripe for this difficult role by virtue of its existence, its philosophy and its bohemian image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why is it that you run the city while red and not in yellow or blue turquoise for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> - I have chosen the red as designer specialized in appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if everything in the society, which is not gray is negative aggressiveness and agitation.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are intended to initiate discussion.</seg>
<seg id="16">The story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> -- And when you understand that you'd be a painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - At the exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood that it was my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">So, the wave of unofficial old painters had passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I started to friends with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there has been more vague.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all except to words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all that is found in your artistic Clinic ... -- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of Saint Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I have taken place to Pouchkinskaya-10 home before work, a musical and artistic club, a club bohemian, the home of the bohemian pétersbourgeoise.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many are born: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Van Gogh's ear".</seg>
<seg id="26">Chnour and his friends sang songs easy for playback in tight shirts, they included Igor Vdovin, composer today.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began to occur in live, it became "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trakhtenberg animait quite emissions before the era of Hali Gali.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trakhtenberg and it is then that his career began, but its basic training and education, it is here that he has received.</seg>
<seg id="30">Galérie" D137", Club" Griboïedov": what are the implications of the artistic Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">Our employees are parties as regulars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the past century, where the culture of the time meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, a survey has been conducted in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">I have been appointed "Painter of the Year", and it is then that my reign has ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is not convenient to work in a new era with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of are different things, there may be popular, but not really a person of culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - Your work is characterized by a recognisable style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Many of my paintings are hits, they have a current and a very high acuity.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'll have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian museum through clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns belong to a category of timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before I was someone of Social, today it hurts and scary to be so.</seg>
<seg id="42">But with clowns, fades, the tragic fall.</seg>
<seg id="43">I like the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the idea of saving the world through the total disguise and mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, it is the habit that is important, the external mechanism, but not to the inside of the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">Perhaps we can not give the hand, but that it should rather him spitting in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the lie will be wiped out by the disguise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - Recently we you saw in the player's role of organ grinder. -- A cultural city must have this kind of hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who else that I can play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> -- But perhaps the commercial art can also be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Today the commercial art must be cared for, delicate, sweet wines.</seg>
<seg id="52">A breakdown of the culture is happening.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian liked something, the corny one another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today, everything is divided in micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a $100 ticket for all things to all people.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today, it seems to you please.</seg>
<seg id="57">Each star has 100 fans.</seg>

<seg id="60">But for the cultural side, 300 people will, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, all dying.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have my fans, the principal is not deceive them, not to spoil the experience.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I was clear that a collector has hung beside Falk tables or Larionov.</seg>

<seg id="64">Today, it often confuses ideas.</seg>
<seg id="65">It said: there was the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">The consumption has not culture, it has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who were living in poverty and died in poverty and that the money for the painting.</seg>

<seg id="71">There was this concept: the staff member of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But all may not work in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under the reign of good czars, this was not like this, the czars understanding the culture, but they need to keep the good experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there was now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people here in St. Petersburg that may be experts, but they are discarded, as it requires higher experts who evaluate properly these experts and their pave a path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Currently, it is the "reign of taste" which blooms.</seg>

<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it is bad.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a lot of curious that will see exhibitions, concerts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">caravans of space shuttles with land to go to the search for a planet of relief.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I believe that it is not much choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was in fact true two planets that can conquer, even hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of State P. K. Chternberg (GAICh).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">If the conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.</seg>
<seg id="10">It can not live at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus ... in outer space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It has begun to look to the reproductive issues in the area focusing on flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">half a century ago, experiments were carried out on the plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown on orbit were not in any way of earth varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Secondly, it has put into orbit of breeding insects, small flies, fruit flies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs have been sent in the space to see how an embryo develops in weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The exit a chick quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is then that the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is linked to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must get on its feet and start to move," says the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of the medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In finding no support, chicks is waved in a disorderly way.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 p.m., new born saw their instincts completely atrophy.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks responded nor to light or sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, they simply die after few days.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We have them écarquillé eyes twice, and then we have given up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev in the failed experiment with chicks in the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last "biological miniature ark with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">The experiments will continue in spring 2013.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the biosatellite Bion" will not species of the same sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, found nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience. It should carry out this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing, the space rats have given birth to their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, it still fails to make reproductions directly in space.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is not an easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to make their instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">Unlike animals, human is able, in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create adequate emotional substance.</seg>
<seg id="36">This kind of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women are in space since 50 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk has been taken by Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the female body is what humanity has the most precious.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our gull soared and person on Earth could not say if it would after a flight in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="41">If she could give birth to a child after the flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Nobody responded to this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé retired, rockets and space sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just a year after its flight in outer space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, Andrian Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in community walk, gave birth to a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We few, very little of cosmonauts who have nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia, Valeriy Poliakov heroes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Laboratory hydrology of cosmonaut preparation center: the compulsory stage of flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here, in neutral buoyancy, cosmonauts train exit walks.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water mimics the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If the water is comfortable for adults, but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.</seg>
<seg id="54">The small amphibious men seem to confirm: the life on Earth from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">As long as the baby is approximately 9 months in the fluid of the belly of its mother, it is easier to get into the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is, in principle, logical, because his first bath since its birth, it is only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It is very unlikely to forget," says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, whether for the child just born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman of gravity, a force of weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In weightlessness, the stomach muscles, atrophy very quickly, the baby of surge capacity is lost.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, don't know it based on birth simulators.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may of course prepare a confinement in a special room, the woman will get.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov invited to reflect on this complex issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If it is not the attraction of the land, the agency does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">On an infant can not dress up as an adult with a special combination for training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will simply be deprived of its basic needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experience that we would in this case in imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will return to Earth on a disabled child, fully désadapté", provides the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of the medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The birth of children in the area is still of the theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, with the time it will become a reality, when Earth will in their shuttle to a distant planet that becomes the habitat of their offspring born in outer space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the ISC (Institution of Public Finance Control) stated: "the control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech" system Švarc") failed to the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has inspectors and high-quality legislation but it is lagging behind with regard to its implementation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is this that said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Institution of control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking here," said Kala in its commentary of the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A control carried out jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggested similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It cites as an example of abuse, the approach of "system Švarc" by Petr Nečas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore possible or not?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be applied in one way or another, then if it prohibits something even the head of government can not prevent action a responsible authority to inspect require compliance with the law," said Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee to the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand which were compared with legislation in the field of public procurement of these two countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it about?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control that we have launched this about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">In simple terms, European legislation to manage how public markets and specific national laws as well as subsequent actual practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have all this and that this process is not yet complete, very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "stronger and better", however, that some parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What this project can help you and that is it for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A common control of this type would contribute to this that we seek to clarify the laws, and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">But lowering the thresholds of contracts, it will not necessarily this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those seeking loopholes will much more opportunities that if the threshold had remained above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk of internal problems regarding the implementation in practice of the public procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">How the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In respect of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it has also a council set up a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a shade, however, compared to our system: Germany with a federal structure, it has therefore also of accounts of this kind at the level of the Länder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Bank can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the State.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, there are controlled at the level of the Länder courts of audit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As regards national legislation, she is more simple than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I would not do an overall comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but it can certainly not say it better in all areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This may be due to the fact that they have the best inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">No, certainly not, but I repeat, I have not the comparison of data.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it should also say that this country that we as a model is also facing a whole range of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has yet to impact on our screening operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we need controls ex post, starting with a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Our observations apply only, for the time being, the process of preparation of future controls -- we have launched a new instrument detection of mismanagement risks" with which we have scrutinised past nearly 14 000 public procurement -- where these changes will, of course, because the thresholds have been modified and that the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Is that you consider the adoption of this law rather than as an asset or as an additional burden for the administration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) to control subjects to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a breach to the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it really appropriate to make the law more severe this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">No, not this way, I think.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those committing formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will put pressure on the administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">What is the solution to get by?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Look where we are.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with the so-called system controls Švarc -- what would that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system Švarc is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be applied in one way or another, then if it prohibits something even the head of government can not prevent action a responsible authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It may declare: "We will change the law and allow", but he can not say that we will act as if nothing had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on procurement has relatively strict rules on formalities to be complied with and that, precisely in order to protect the tender.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only due to formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and it is, in my view, what is lacking here.</seg>

<seg id="17">Of course, at the end, finally, if we are successful and that is not the end of the world ...</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be performed simultaneously by all the interpreters in three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The anthems will also at some point in the context of a live program, very unique, Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The lyrics of the song had been written by Tomáš Hanák also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings ...</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you have to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We collaborate with other personalities show-biz Czech, in view of the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events ...</seg>
<seg id="23">We strive to participate intensively to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equip the training center Studeo which is accessible to persons with reduced mobility and which we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička Tap, and that since six years, with the association.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly with students of the Institute Jedličkův and offer activities that interest them and enjoy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to visit of course, we try to help in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička will this project in a new independent building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Several musical groups and performers climb on stage at each of these concerts?</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria have you chosen them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to develop a program that speaks to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, will stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You will find all details on www. kpks. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Prepare also to other "mega events" of this kind in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will for the first time in the framework of the Prague spring; here too, we will surely a program of quality with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">We also play next year in the house of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, to the United States, I want to mix concerts in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your international projects are minimal, so far you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of persons with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you carry the organization and logistics of your touring?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so terrible that it has the air at first.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members in an electric wheelchair, which gear must travel in the hold, naturally we trimbalons also a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments ....</seg>
<seg id="43">So far everything is more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently, everything happened without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ with respect to accessibility for persons with reduced mobility, to the attitude of the public opinion of persons with disabilities and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What were your experiences until now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed to Moscow that is all that is still in an initial phase.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is still accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that only a person travels in the electric chair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">not yet seen as a clear priority to a person in a wheelchair in a lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there also, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">What must we catch up more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There was a lot of things for which we are still behind ...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is important to mention that the improvements and improvements are always the efforts deployed by the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a severe disability travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, at the museum, anywhere ...</seg>
<seg id="55">This is not very frequent there that a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, are you, The Tap Tap, rather the contrary to the cutting edge!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect for the public and access are one thing, but the situation will start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, famous politicians or lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="57">For the moment, this is not that isolated cases of persons who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, back in the rear of a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And as I am myself a musician (I played, among other things, the saxophone) -- with a colleague, we created a music activity.</seg>
<seg id="61">And then, over time, as our moderator said Láďa Angelovič, was a bit lost control of the situation (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The success came during these last years, if I am not mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">That is true, the fact of creating links with known singers and work actively to the promotion of the group helped us.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as though they do not exist in the background.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, we have the quality of teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change.</seg>
<seg id="68">The show business is full of tips that copy each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a person who we see for the first time the pity is, of course, this is natural ...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with a disability are not ill persons, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">What are people who can live a full life and to flourish, as a condition to have the necessary means of course.</seg>
<seg id="74">I often say that when people with disabilities are to achieve something, this is not only a step forward for them but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Is that your success is also due to the fact that you are a leader, as you are qualified by a lot of people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do good work, we must be intransigent in many areas and discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that it is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come here with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to rehearsals two times per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend much time on the road for a concert, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve objectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The group The Tap Tap currently twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of these were already there in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">A single, Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.</seg>
<seg id="84">Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the case the day before the day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">This action is taking place in Prague in the arena Incheba, Brno to Fléda and Ostrava to Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">In late night, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song will be sung together the group canceled "The Tap Tap "End of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The purpose of the consultation is to collect financial means (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multipurpose training center Studeo located in Prague in the institute Jedlička.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The price of a ticket to this concert is CZK 400, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland had started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has been involved in a number of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poland's road to space has, however, began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War, Poles enthusiasts working on space flights; they did not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to mention for example the conference of A. Šternfeld astronomical observatory of Warsaw on December 6, 1933, in the course of which he presented ideas from the leading edge of his "Introduction to space travel."</seg>
<seg id="7">The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left viewers cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski became interested in its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to space travel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 -- 1966) subsequently became a big propagator of astronomy and space travel.</seg>
<seg id="10">It published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote several books devoted to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became an initiator of the world-renowned Astronautics, its contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden face of the Moon craters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">As early as 1925 was built in Poland a car intended to be a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear if the rocket was used to propel or impede the car.</seg>
<seg id="15">The only information known on this car are those of the press of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.</seg>
<seg id="18">It records that this research had reached the stage of testing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, a rocket of photoelectric hunting plans, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta -- torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">These two projects were designed for military use of rocket motors.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the rocketry projects were carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy") which coordinated all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After the war, more work devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time, it is a question of society in the November issue of 1954 newspaper Problem, in which four more detailed articles are devoted to aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research was of the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter in the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and the fall, the PTA became a regular member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 -- 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He retained his office until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the ATP made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">This rocket of a scope of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the result was an upgraded version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket Rehabilitation were initiated in the desert of Bledov.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket had a length of 1.4 m and probably weighed 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next prototype should be able to perform specific scientific work -- the rocket RM-34 should have had a scope up 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind aloft.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1963, all development work were stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period of 1962 -- 1965, succeeded to the former type of rocket RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">This rocket, designed with two floors and an initial weight, had a total of 510 cm length of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they are distinguished by the dimensions of the space to scientific tools.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 per litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 per litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum of all these types of gear was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period 1965 -- 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials started in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It still mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) COSPAR in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after the second Vladimír Remek, cosmonaut non-soviétique of this program.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public utility work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on the work of public utility.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision has raised a lively discussion in public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no doubt interesting to examine this issue in a broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The directed economic systems towards liberalism, both in the EU in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means that different economic entities as well as national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of the freedom of trade and the free movement (without limitations) of private capital ally to unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The considerable differences in the price of labor (wage) generate tension on prices.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be put under the meaning of this term: a producer tries by the importation of the goods sold to the bottom taken to resist economic competition in "making the more expensive price of competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the macro level, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where the labor prices are high in comparison to other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given that the private capital has no responsibility of the social point of view and thus of responsibility vis a vis the unemployment it creates social charges of the State necessarily increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">All of this is the perfect unwillingness of contractors to pay taxes and to make economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race to profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">unscrupulous practices of private capital to create a situation in which the Governments of various economies of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower the level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, Governments are their own people to the mercy of private capital without taking into account of the social collapse.</seg>
<seg id="16">This occurs primarily in the amendments of the laws in force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objective is to compel economically on its own population to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This occurs on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and the other by the restriction of the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result, a growing poverty and the deepening of differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, it has existed for many years of public distribution points for food for the poor who can not meet their needs with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">Already by millions the number of such persons.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that such employees receive wages that the State is obliged to pay a surcharge they reach the subsistence minimum.</seg>
<seg id="23">One such scandal has for example been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economy of almost all the Member States of the EU's southern generated, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the company, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or eke out a living with poverty wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital investment in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">It must here to ask the question: where will this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty from one country to another; this capital can not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or Africans will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and media say, to get bored with it, that the State can not make capital investment in its own economy, that economy led led to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital fiercely defends the idea that the State can not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.</seg>
<seg id="30">It must wonder if private capital does not influence and, even, is not now, according to its own selfish interests, and the same policy, the State as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer to this question is certainly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The evidence is that there is a virtually omnipotent lobby and present in all States.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not indictable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such, that due to lack of financial resources, national ministries, delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the power is not the people, as the state constitutions of Western type, but of powerful financial groups for their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that democracies oriented toward liberalism are now quickly to face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long failed states and functions were assigned by the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The beating of bribes, favors received unlawfully, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.</seg>
<seg id="39">The kickbacks and corruption have proliferated without limits and the people go to elections with votes have already been sold." ... "The honest people looking any functions, it was once again that the State was 8 months without Consuls ... ' It began really to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it should choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos to Pompey, but César irreversibly transformed the democracy in an absolutist system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="41">In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and advance the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="42">As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to make sweeping reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state of things, may be regarded as the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies of type as a kind of pause before a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the current elites ignore totally the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises which we are now witnesses as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by ancient and recent history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public utility work is not a solution, at least in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is in systemic effect.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is in socio-political reforms to be covered, which will increase investment in the capital of the State in the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't think on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its recurrent waves of killings; after all, the current population of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and the beginning of the violence have not lived.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to offer readers a point of view located behind the Iron Curtain," on which mainly of still present tensions already since more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small bout of Middle East countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the other study, from my own understanding of that, or more exactly the group, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether these individuals acting independently or if they were their acts to the throne to someone who led their acts on the basis of clearly defined objectives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We need to acknowledge that we live in an era where global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration causing some powers has not been done in the course of a single generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among families with unique astronomical wealth the Rothschild family, which might be seen as the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not excluded).</seg>
<seg id="14">Little is written about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the 1990s the 19th century, they have acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and that had always served to them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their property or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have major interests in almost the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or lead wars against countries in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 5, 7, after the invasion of Iraq after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, since Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Any person who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue its own money during the civil war (government, I) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF for having triggered the Great Depression of 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a mob consisting of Islamist students took stormed the American Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime over several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation did not provide positive outcome to the US administration, it could not, in effect, abandoning the Shah, because it would severely shaken the confidence of his allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow later compounded by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight provoked a wave of solidarity and a sense of the U.S. anti-Iran.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film actor and director Ben Affleck's Argo, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before it is occupied, escaped six employees of the embassy.</seg>
<seg id="12">After complicated saga, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them to Iran through a coverage incredible: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a crew came to locations for the filming of a movie to show of science fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To make the story more credible, specialized magazines were state film project, of press conferences were organized and a fake production company had real offices.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation remained long secret, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several types.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically, but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal -- such as, for example, in the Ocean's trilogy eleven, twelve and thirteen.</seg>
<seg id="20">The environments are: Tehran sequences of documentary style (in subtitled sequences are iconic photographs of the time of the events and the manner in which, thanks to those photos, those situations have been transcribed in the film, no large differences)</seg>
<seg id="21">lighter parts of Hollywood, treaties with irony and a bit of exaggeration,</seg>
<seg id="22">and then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and its acting ceased generating sarcastic remarks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature after the dark police "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is also the first film Affleck is not in his hometown, Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put his first films over Hollywood standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere where the role of Tehran in Argo" is "by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film takes place in streets, at the reconstruction of the facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, wrote a page in history.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his staff have a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the false crew in the bazaar of Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many shares at too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had just a subject is in fact little exciting scenes in the film sense of the term.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is, well, he sometimes added certain elements to the reality and here, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a phone call and the continuation of the runway on landing in America are pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Argo weakness lies in its nature dissipated, owing to the need to show too many events too many different locations.</seg>
<seg id="35">While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman is completely charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters have earned a larger place and what is not, far from it, only in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, it is with moderate interest in assessing the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">It causes the viewer, but with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to this day, and as an example of the excessive representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it made the case.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules for balloons, bananas and the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server at bankovnipoplatky. com, which conducts each year a public inquiry on bank charges the most absurd, decided, at present, to launch the competition's rules or ideas from "the workshop of the EU "the most absurd.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The fact that the EU intends, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the direction of European big business has been at the origin of our decision," said the newspaper Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among mentioned nonsense, there already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far, however, women were an advantage for what is life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">People can report any other ideas until the end of the year also incredible "the workshop of the EU".</seg>
<seg id="7">"The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013," informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components of the fuel, which has detrimental consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size of cages chickens, which has led the increase in the price of eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Critics have also been issued by the past against the prohibition of the use of the expression "butter spreads or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The European administration is often under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that the bananas in the Union, must not be of a size less than 14 cm or submit an "abnormal curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was not that the harmonization of national standards not homogeneous that complicated the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing guidelines are a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU Regulation last year that must appear on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU has made reference to a U.S. survey that balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of child deaths by suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age in blowing trumpets of fair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here also, on a bizarre ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU can not use the name "Macedonia" and, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" grouping of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky. com has appointed in this investigation, the Regulation mentioned above, in addition to some of the nonsense of the Union concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU had set the maximum volume for food reserves may find themselves on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic beyond then, for example, volumes set for canned mushrooms and risqua, of this fact, a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of awarding a grant for the granting of subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas are not, however, not from Brussels but of Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The fact of not having the sea give us.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will request a refund to the European Union". This is expressed, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">It argued that, because of our production of wheat, and continued to purchase so-called "interventionist", the State was found with full stocks that he had then export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, the EU ought to pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is a long distance from ports.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic and held a tender for the purchase of wheat from country without maritime access.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for grants have been proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) should, in practice, be used to write grant applications granted by Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU said: "bizarre regulations are rare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">If the regulations are often criticized in the Member States, the view of many experts, the efforts of the EU regulation and improvement of the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of general development, rather than deserve praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, to fight to Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these traditional products (fight which it does not always winner) brings out strong emotions among Czech citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If the term of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for which the appellation "Tuzemský rum" back home in the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "Tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">Only the alcohol products of cane sugar, and not to sugar beet, can bear the name of rum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products from the EU, is now internationally known as the "Feta cheese company or the Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary") carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and the hops of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").</seg>
<seg id="38">The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets of Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Senator, how was the idea to stand in presidential elections?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is not to be a senator or president that matters to me.</seg>
<seg id="4">If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not candidate anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I see more as the country was robbed in the last twenty years, thieves are not locked and increase taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had not the ambition of becoming a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that does not please me, then I try to find a solution for that change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as I have over 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other options for influencing the situation that I submit to presidential or senatorial elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You entered the Senate but you quickly to the Château (N. d. T.: the seat of the presidency).</seg>
<seg id="10">Is it that you do not turn their backs to those who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have always said that I will in the battle for the Château depending on the results of the senatorial elections</seg>
<seg id="12">Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would to presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not the function, it is not merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is why I need the strongest influence and the broader mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not only that we as a nation râlons at the bar or in front of our TV, but it is also that we cough, those who are trying to make the change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Added to this is the press that scrapping the reputation of people and confused freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">It has, for example, said to my statement that I bribes or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Now your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have started the fight for the Château with the themes as a criminal and material responsibility of the politicians and retroactive beyond 20 million tax returns (CZK).</seg>
<seg id="20">You must to this end to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When, as a citizen, I lobbied for a liberal profession constitute activities of a tourist guide, I won.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the politicking: when someone comes in from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent, a member of any party, I have much more likely to receive the support of all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have an advantage, without categorization and dogma advocates, to each party that is best for our countries and implement it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider you as a human right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me rather to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, that this is a bit to the left or right, this is not really important.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, the important thing is that we move forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">What matters to me, this is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act as impartially against bad ideas.</seg>

<seg id="36">You try to bring you.</seg>
<seg id="37">Some may call it populism, but all the proposals which I have been implemented by the world and of recognized experts have spoken about this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament, the only thing left of slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">You survivrez not long in politics with this.</seg>
<seg id="40">Do you that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you'll get in, for example, to impose the criminal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and to bring them to my camp to impose.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, this would not be a problem of the live broadcast television to my request to the Chairpersons of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the criminal and material responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">When there will be a strong personality that identify abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take for example the election of the president in direct elections, it has been obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I, clearly, be a fan, and not a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try and find allies for my opinions and my views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I just started in politics and I tried to obtain the support of the majority of my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try, alone, can make a difference, and if it doesn't, I'll quit in six years and I get back in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is a bit like if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one person may not make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="54">I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová revealed oil fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I presented myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people have not voted and who did have, for the most part, given voice to a representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are both independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have elected a Senate unlikely to impose any changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite everything, I, for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and prefects of the regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you base your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">No, not yet, because I do not have the time to verify if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I did not have the financial means.</seg>
<seg id="63">I did not have more money for my presidential campaign, I have that twenty thousand on my account "transparent".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk of tax returns, what is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimated to approximately 60 million the value of my personal property.</seg>
<seg id="67">I to a ground of a value of $25 million, an apartment in Prague for a value of 10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth $3.5 million and a Skoda Superb a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Either way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always liked James Bond, traveling in the car, was gallant with women and fighting against harm and abuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million for this campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I am in debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I couldn't live, for example, pay the English school of my son who is 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If my only goal was to make money, I am not present in any elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You will therefore continue commercial activities in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Do you assert that you put down your activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this is not linked to the amount of such earnings.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my Deputy will spring the direction of travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="85">People like that I am a Good Samaritan who saves the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But although I live of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">What was your usual monthly salary when you contractor?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.</seg>

<seg id="5">Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today, one will not voluntarily in one of these libraries of yore, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a bedroom community that is attractive to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a unique record.</seg>
<seg id="8">The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To give a few neurons to brain drain, the city decided, a few years ago, contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the banknotes in the form of small, beautiful painted miniatures in reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the offensive cultural remained limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is as well that the city authorities realized that there is only one way to take a lead on statistics: the construction of a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold and creative bar diagrams of witty and often cynical buildings, agreed the project with his usual unflappability and ran the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while members of the board is still watched, bewildered and shrug, Maas, the brash, empila books of choice by order of size to a pyramid, and ended his speech substantiated arguments activists by a "common expensive!"</seg>
<seg id="14">The now, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros came from land.</seg>
<seg id="16">The building is in a revitalization project with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses, for a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books received second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It is as well that this drab town that until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white walls invite to think that they support a dairy, a contemporary architectural work has been enriched.</seg>
<seg id="20">The most important is that Spijkenisse now has the first cultural building to the public of its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long path towards the reading</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Eldorado's book under glass to cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The procedure made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the soil in Dutch bricks and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">Efforts already regard public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books, books and even books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally, library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have completely changed the classical space configuration and open spaces of the reading of the Interior to the outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain of books has been cleverly constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the central technical building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special beauty lies in black shelves of the library, which are sometimes of wainscoting, sometimes railings, sometimes of stair railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even hardened architects and construction engineers want not unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as well that one day we found in a farming business Frisian a ad hoc waste from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the Netherlands, used for years a millimeter of a synthetic membrane as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and of playing for time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates with a thickness of 4 cm.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) change of color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including the smell of a new car and sports footwear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On top of 105 steps is the summit of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">After nearly 500 metres, the literary café offers a magnificent view over the city, but also Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.</seg>
<seg id="43">They create an atmosphere, but above all to maintain the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"This is incredible, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in the area of ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The temperature of the building is geothermally.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books is the sun under a glass bell, lights that shortly the procedure, even on sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The thick wooden beams mounted across the facade of glass used in relation to sun visors, intercepting a large part of rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The atmosphere is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The fully automated blinds can do the rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the computer system, was already risky to enter in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette Verhaig also was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Cynthia Bogarde, Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, describes the same Boekenberg as "soul finally found "Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.</seg>
<seg id="55">This measure has helped fill in the gaps of the library that was not yet fully furnished (today, 70,000 pounds).</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is a success.</seg>
<seg id="57">The rays are from all sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."</seg>
<seg id="59">"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between individual citizens and this new building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if this is just for decoration."</seg>
<seg id="62">It is as well as MVRDV has reached the main discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Although it may seem young and poorly educated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is finally a new point of departure for the birth of an identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has chosen the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of an observer State to the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was then chosen forbearance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Berlin needed to be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But I also think that it not only supports the US position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to assert his independence, but not be too critical toward Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, NATO imposed this measure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany finds difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans therefore face a number of fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that they play a more independent role, but they are not used.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that they are yet to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal".</seg>
<seg id="20">An external policy, such as in France or Britain</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What then concretely the term "normal" foreign policy to the Germans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the commitment to adopt independent positions from those of the U.S. and European partners, including with regard to national records.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany should protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention of the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is without doubt a decisive point.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, I would not too much, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But there is a key element in any case in German strategic thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany to affect its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious that she was in the case of the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps even that Germany will most respected.</seg>
<seg id="35">In effect, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the United States have announced their veto in a clear voice.</seg>
<seg id="38">The opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There has always been differences because of American domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama Administration secretly is evidence of a great deal of understanding towards the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">However the political configuration of the country, the Government can, of course, not defend its position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that true differences of opinions are not always so large that they seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not keen to the respect of the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany finds difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of major European partners, on the other hand?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that it does not facilitate things for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, this would be a little more simple for the Germans if there is a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They can not register within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is what they are currently in the question of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">In my opinion, Germany will in the future a locomotive role will Europe adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is not just for Germany, particularly because relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This issue has always been difficult.</seg>
<seg id="52">But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that mark more independence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany it play a role player on the international scene, Germany is only assume a key role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or she has still to take leading roles?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany still is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country has still to play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look, for example, the crisis of the euro, is that each time that Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands can be heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not facilitate things for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a far more difficult position that the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must deal with neighbors and very diverse opinions, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Today, U.S. influence on the European policy only decrease, but at this time, the EU does not fill that vacuum, then who is left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="63">And even if it does not like them, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, it is the life!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of Trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Armani Polo ... what is it really?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.</seg>
<seg id="5">The trade mark as such protection that the company that bears the name can not file a complaint.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even if it could, it is not sure that it would succeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is increasingly difficult for aliens to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, the lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, a new record arrives on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also copy legally as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file cabinet in which the records are made to the trademark office of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company has filed the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in a part of the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is a known fact that the Chinese are now the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">In major cities, is shopping centres to several floors that do sell virtually that of counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">The case of Pattloch are however different: its constituents do address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office to formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", of the parent brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">It is with this term that women who are married to rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities say nothing for which to reproach themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"That is bad for business, it must combat this trend," requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, damage to reputation is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and costs of justice are in millions for the sectors concerned, particularly with respect to the expensive products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the data of the CLSA market analysis company, in China, with an annual volume of € 15 billion, the third global market for luxury goods and expanding the most quickly.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, it is not easy to cancel registrations doubtful of the register of marks and these procedures are expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reported trial during which the Court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period, criticised the name had become a "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Pattloch explains that if the complainant did not, it may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would hurt its brand in China.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that prevails.</seg>
<seg id="30">famous cases include graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that was to redeem the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely, Volvo, logger used before a blue and white logo that recalled that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the terms of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trademark office CTMO Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the Office would be spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a new-found normality."</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures have fallen 22 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain outstanding to the office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Action is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million of trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time on the index for the number of new deposits in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This would also for the total number of trademark law, which is 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of the registration fee.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, each record reported average 1,348 yuan, or € 160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">A legal battle costing much more, as the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the company fought against a Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course, the Germans could obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the impersonator could maintain its Chinese rights on the trademark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"It is our fault, because the names of the family can not be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, president of the leadership of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trademark office had therefore rejected the objection of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freudenberg has obtained from the following two bodies, but the other side continued fighting until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">The vigilance is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praised the professionalism of judges.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, he adds: "the procedure is lengthy, stressful and costs us a lot of time and money."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives had even review the acts of the last hundred years to provide proof.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed a "large sum in euros in vain to the opposing party to six figures" to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="61">"That is what it is for us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East or even beyond Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">This would be the case if this region of imitators ensured the exploitation of protected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, a Chinese producer to submit the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a company of production of footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Wentzler adds: "vigilance is called for."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pattloch and advising him to German companies show a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough, they rely on international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather save everything that is likely to be protected also in China," said Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the legal battle in the last act of his drama, the company should pay a licence fee to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or, we lose our place on the segment of the market in question.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First, they tap their feet: the cowboy boots, shoes, the escarpins moccasins for women and for men seeking the pace in the soil of the foot. Very soon, they are.</seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Secondly, the voices of singers increase slowly -- low, alto, tenor and soprano -- they prevail, bewitch and follow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with its wild gestures of flexibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">We Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the Music Room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years, the geneticist in human medicine man at home.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each singer has different words, in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Being helped to help themselves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimated that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Swaziland 245.000 infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa".</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros less, you could become the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="19">This guarantees the child the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meals to the exhibition center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in Zulu "storytelling" or "praise singer".</seg>
<seg id="21">No one can not speak Bantu fluent in the language in this region, but all can sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this language that it has brought in Germany for now make to his native region: the South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because 8.733 km as the crow flies to Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the power of voice of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">40% of people</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The village has about 2,000 residents, some live in small huts of straw or soil and the majority of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has won their parents.</seg>
<seg id="27">At Esitjeni, may be seen in smaller evils besetting the Swaziland: the higher the rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population accept almost never proven male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction of the risk of infection by half.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is the carrier of human immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in their mid-thirties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When a group traveling in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have especially seen many children in the street that it not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In a poor country, without school, there simply no perspective.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning, it was that of a few persons who undertook personally to make a few euros each year to be able to send a child to school and providing a hot meal per day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But just a year later, the choir was "Voices for Africa", an association which has since almost professional manner of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.</seg>

<seg id="37">The common STIs are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups concerned?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea are often among men who have sex with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sexual contact between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five reported in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The adult heterosexual infections related to chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal) gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The rate of the spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur among this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people, a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What is the evolution of the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the emergence of buttons and warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, they do not regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How to protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.</seg>
<seg id="58">The reason is that the sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also spread infection by lubricating or by close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing sexual partners often spend regular breast examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">Most quickly diagnosed STIs can be treated successfully and late sequelae can be prevented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through sponsorships, donations, but mainly to funds that are full members through their votes across Germany, accumulate.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In all, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," states Annette Lennartz, the association's president.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and that always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It shall also ensure that orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The sucker, as well as the so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and to ensure that they are traveling each day to the hour to the school in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">An orphan who was more person is allowed in a safe place, in a PPASA, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as two cooks preparing daily meals to more than 200 starving children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a school of couture and permit the construction of two barns. With the assistance of the American for the health organization PSI, the association has organized a HIV test for many people.</seg>
<seg id="69">This does not of itself, because even if the disease is clearly visible in the entire country, it is still a taboo subject.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king and his 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects the sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">It is curious, coming from a country in which the king has 14 wives official.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">The polygamy to the establishment of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">yet found condoms at every street corner, says Annette Lennartz," but almost nobody uses them.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different, flesh against flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To foster some cultural exchange, choristers of Imbongi go together in all travel two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, of courage, confidence and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still during the apartheid era.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humor and joy, but hard sometimes as a tear to some formidable border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where singers to visit their godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Valley of the Ezulweni.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitjeni, you find the light," say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after a journey of 8.733 km as the crow flies, Heidelberg, before these singers to return their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Str, also found the light.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although this planet is the closer to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as the three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet continuously diving in the shade.</seg>
<seg id="7">This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 cm up to 20 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water is probably of comets or asteroids that have perhaps hit Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet," says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">The discovery could help to understand how the water and other essential elements, arrived in other regions of the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Inaperçus inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">This infrared detail of a photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and pink points, more difficult to identify, are "born" in the delivery room of the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, to 6,500 light years away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a dying star.</seg>

<seg id="30">One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is on the creation of Saturn's rings.</seg>
<seg id="31">One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without trace.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light years away.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name of the Trifid comes from the Latin word "E. trifidus" (divided, shared in three) since three shiny streaks of dust into the heart of the place of birth of stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Ophiuchus: 400 million light-years of Earth, two nuclei merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.</seg>

<seg id="39">The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula of Iris, in the constellation Cepheus.</seg>
<seg id="40">The nebula lies 1,400 light-years and is composed of particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the common household dust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This photo was developed from optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes.</seg>
<seg id="42">You can see the circle consisting of black holes found to 430 million light-years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.</seg>
<seg id="44">Scientists have named the larger spiral galaxy" GC 1810."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, it is not yet in place of dust, there's gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Scientists believe that it is born shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our eyes on the universe: the major telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo does use a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since mirrors with optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and through them, it was possible to see ever more distant in the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror image had a diameter of 5 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors with each 8.4 metres in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias to La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached 10.4 m diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.</seg>
<seg id="59">The diameter reached approximately 11 metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of vertical angle, which restricts mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope Hobby-Eberly Texas is also set at the level of vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its unique features to its large collection of light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to mirror those of the biggest telescopes in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Scientists listen the universe to the search for alien signals to the aid of radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico).</seg>
<seg id="65">The telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.</seg>
<seg id="66">Any person owns a computer can contribute to the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or the search of extraterrestrial intelligence") using the computing power of its machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Overview on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here is the Very Large Telescope ('' the Very Large Telescope") a facility worthy of its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope may inform the mid-infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The construction of a very large telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.</seg>
<seg id="71">His main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 items of mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the telescope can not take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007, two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were regarded as the world's largest.</seg>
<seg id="74">They wore two mirrors of a diameter of 10 metres each.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck telescopes are part of the observatory's who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea and the IRTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror reaches 30 metres.</seg>
<seg id="77">This illustration can admire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important space images from the Hubble Space Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990, we book of images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.</seg>
<seg id="82">This photo illustrates final preparations before the launch of the space telescope Kepler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space in early 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.</seg>
<seg id="84">The first infrared space telescope's mirror has a diameter of about 6.5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="85">The telescope will mission of finding the projected light by the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists think that the South Pole of Mercury is also of the ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.</seg>
<seg id="89">With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to circling around of Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The trip in the Talysh Mountains is a romantic, unbridled.</seg>
<seg id="9">In many turns of the road, the small bus cahote torrential rivers along forested hills, and small farms.</seg>
<seg id="10">All is green and fertile, almost in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But we are here in the south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is not just a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh live, about which little is known, if not whether they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very long lifetime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminus: Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small town plastronne with overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.</seg>
<seg id="16">It takes eight hours to go the 323 miles, because the road was the only way.</seg>
<seg id="17">The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist site.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May through the Eurovision competition, and the next year, there will be by the festival of the world's oldest people," explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the museum's director of longevity, the only museum of the kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">It may discover the lives of about eight decades of Talysh region which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.</seg>
<seg id="22">Here is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Having a child to 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is not, however, a birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when we think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov appears more than doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was born in this region in 1805, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man allegedly married three times and it would have been 23 children. At the age of 136 years, he would have designed a girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Şirali Müslümov would it wrong a few decades in calculating its age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, it has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There are also strikingly older persons in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz," in Sardinia also, there are people living incredibly old."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, but that no civil registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Each day, a glass of melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is, however, that the people of the region of Lerik often reach a worthy age of the patriarchs of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">What is the reason of longevity in the South of this country?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Farid Mugimzadeh, Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a question of food.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that meals rich in calories Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of people? The Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With its 97 years old, it is still relatively young for the region.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which states have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is sitting on the ground next to a churn, it beats the content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who are long adults.</seg>
<seg id="45">Two small children tumble also in the house.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen, it prepares tea for guests served in glasses armadus typical in form of belly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding a dark blond dreadlocks that his son reveals with pride.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have always washed my hair with milk, and it is as well that I never lost and that they have retained their color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The monthly pension is enough to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She always eaten this from his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">In my lifetime, I never bought any food in a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then, she spoke of her husband who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst moments were after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">But any improved when the "beloved" father Heydar Aliyev took orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country like a dictator, almost knows no limits in Azerbaijan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">It has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, the older people of Azerbaijan did not know the distress.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) for his retirement, an amount that ensures a good life in the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe the son long greying of Mirzayeva was right: "seniors enjoy great respect in our culture."</seg>
<seg id="62">They are the center of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is a good reason to live as long as possible.</seg>

<seg id="22">During the reign of Mubarak, these courts began to suppress opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.</seg>
<seg id="24">The State must also be read in the draft, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could check the contents of filmmaking art and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Clearly, it is simply censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In addition, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead, another article prohibits insulting or defaming the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the article defines not what an offence is or how it should be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is prohibited to "offend people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Is it draw a cartoon of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?</seg>
<seg id="32">Many issues are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and that, in his own words, will "very soon" the subject of a referendum for Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution renait"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The opposition rallying for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to sharia law before its entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution is reborn and we're going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history".</seg>
<seg id="38">On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of trying to foment a "coup against democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and on the reverse," said Jasser Said, an opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We're not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned", said that the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, several judges have not announced if monitor the referendum, which would entail its annulment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our Constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the Muslim brotherhood, well organized, has called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who have participated in large numbers, chanting "the people want the application of the law of God."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"cleanses our country!", asked to Morsi, saying that "the Koran (their) Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where everything began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Clearly, it is this that Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim Brotherhood reported that the opponents of the Constitution, in the same way that its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by vote of the direction that the country should take.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Islamists will certainly the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Human rights are not mentioned once."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is anger against this constitutional process imposed which should continue until February and encompass all social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were in prison or the courts under Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">It has done so not because it shared their vision of the world, but because that human rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">That is the reason for which he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now, the term is not a time in the new Constitution," he says during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.</seg>
<seg id="57">The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President to de facto all its powers," regrets Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, a democracy can not function without the organizations of civil society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, that watching the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could afford.</seg>
<seg id="63">One protester on the place Thahir warns: "you accouchez a monster that it will be possible to control."</seg>

<seg id="1">The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most fragrant of the world's fish?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million people in Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of extremely fragrant premises for a fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wait a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, at approximately 3 a.m. Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">The snow, the landscape is spectacular -- and this, pervasive smell permeates the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled salt and fermented in water for a time -- the smell that you want it exhaling -- which can go up to a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When darkness settled and it's cold, the Norwegians gathered in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, incredible Fagernes, devoted to this culinary speciality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local firefighter that so-called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us, people ingest small pieces of fish and to don a vast quantity of drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk," adds Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink kills the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I tried a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid getting under your nose, this is not bad -- it suggests to a sushi who spent long hours in a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof barrels of water to the air, then salted in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, during the winter, a time many fermented, the fish is out and -- no doubt with direction undermined by alcohol -- ate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, emigrant primarily to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">At present, the population is growing rapidly -- more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Swedes, their old rivals which richer countries was not so long that Norway, crossing the border to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, as well as fragrant, the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is the most expensive dishes.</seg>
<seg id="25">But everything is expensive -- a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you € 10 each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often speak of it in the news, which is not to displease him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here, people are not willing to speak of the racist right-wing extremist Anders Breivik that killed 77 people, including women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When they evoke this killing, they speak of "the incident of 22 July".</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians struggling to accept that one of their own in their peaceful country, could commit such an act of barbarism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Since the early 1970s, Norway should its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But the oil is not the single reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, to numbing blonde hair and blue eyes, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a shelf of rakfisk hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We -- How do you say, conservative people.</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are discrete, we do not like us to point out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution -- everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When other countries throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led to the global financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep its purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"Until you can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And the rakfisk", she adds in a carefree laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am standing in the snow and I am the queue to buy me anything to eat -- I've had my dose of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the menu, a burger consisting of momentum, a discovery, it is excellent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But this night, the smell of fish is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel in which I reside is one of many places where serves the rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them -- or perhaps the most fragrant of them.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was a TV presenter is a trademark bowties, surrounded plates of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is the Eurovision competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What have you score given the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico's economy is doing well, results that must to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is prey to a drug war that has already cost the life to about 60,000 people in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has taken the commitment towards the Mexican people to reduce the violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I propose a new strategy in the field of security which will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Prior to the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">A sprawling and populous state that encircles the capital city. In its country, opinions regarding this new leader are divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct human</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.</seg>

<seg id="16">To reach the city, you can take one of new motorways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, formerly dented and full of cracks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plates bearing his name are attached to the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We count on him to put in place lasting change," said his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of congress and Pena Nieto, the PRI of the M party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In terms of safety and economy, we expect real change our country needs so badly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years without fault in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The member of congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace at Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party on Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">It rejects criticism of opponents who accuse the president of lacking charisma.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is a human whole, very committed, with excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is a great statesman and, above all, it knows to listen.</seg>

<seg id="26">At Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Critics say Mr. Pena Nieto, at best, it has not managed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.</seg>
<seg id="33">At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities treated me as if I was an old gossipy, a fautrice of disorder, a pleurnicheuse.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want to accept what they say and that we stay quiet.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But this is not right that so many irregularities and omissions," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bradley Manning not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of abuse which Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The trial focuses on Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning was in extremely difficult conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Prosecutors have attempted to demonstrate, on Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information of any history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain of ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft.. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in prison in Quantico, Virginia, found no complaint concerning his treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that Manning be dismissed on the grounds that the kidnapping was in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This analyst of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At the hearing Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he has been subjected to a maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officers asked to Manning and recorded her answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Fein mentioned forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that it reserved its guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had within the prison was "very professional."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms do not state any complaint for ill-treatment, many officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison," said Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns regarding a number of problems and that visiting officers had discussed its concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded with the problems referred to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They wrote "no problems" (after having discussed the concerns) and for all, this meant that I had not raised problems," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he was not complaining about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he expressed in writing a few months earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning responded that its intention during the meeting was to change its restrictive status indicating a risk of injury."</seg>
<seg id="20">The military reported that they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and the safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted the staff know that I was okay, and I wanted that I cut this status ... in order to enjoy a better quality of life of my point of view," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and vanished once because of the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He added that the fact of not having been informed of what it was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought that I was going to die in this cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning has also added that the only objects which he had had a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has tried to remain in motion, because sleep or lie down for the day was contrary to the rules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning has also clarified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eye, lit outside his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the guards were not his face when he turned the night, they up to see his face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Manning's lawyer has filed a formal complaint to the treatments by Manning in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning has been placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Friday, also, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after having been forced to sleep naked every night in his cell at Quantico, was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners in the morning, during the appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover with a cover during the call.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning said he had deducted in the order of its warning that it would release its coverage that could hide her nudity, but it acknowledged that it had ordered the release.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, as he tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said to the officer that he could use the elastic from his underpants or its flip-flops to harm themselves, but that it had not done so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and that it reduce his sentence if he should be convicted before a court martial, a trial should be held early next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty of minor offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who argued that conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges brought against Manning include the theft of public property or records, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information concerning national defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If all counts, he faces life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="20">He wants to ally with the U.S. and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto pledged to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although it has not provided more details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to assign writing half of their territory to the gun.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a formal U.S. criticism against Mexico's formula, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints on how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, the more difficult for Mexico, the relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million of Mexico-Américains living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to address the subject of bitterness?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are many.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has its winners and its losers, and other persons to which the countries offers opportunities for in the country.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at any given time, a person, in our family tree, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than not, this person was a profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even if we currently live the American dream, that we've been in good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that is the American dream that we live, and not that of Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="37">We attach to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the elite do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We remind us of a humiliating defeat and they, as if we were individuals of lower and not sufficiently Mexican strain.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will not be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never materialize parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we would not get stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as of lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and the Mexico-Américains, because Mexicans more strongly assert their identity and the Mexico-Américains are upset.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is a United States citizen, she has the sense to make part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In addition, many Mexico-Américains I know did not feel part of a country or the other.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, it sees us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the United States, we consider as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And now, for a little more complicated relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want closer of the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, in representing its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We must explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country visit and put the pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, considering the wage gap, corruption and violence linked to the drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">You'll get only, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It's normal.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Américains their want always treated the way in which the members of their family have been there so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Do will never have sustainable peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">A further bloodshed suggests that such hope is vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">While still futile to know that the same arguments began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near the metropolis of Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has shattered, and we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps their fight yet a little more.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there was every reason to believe that this could help to overcome this impasse deadly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war which does no losers or no winner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems difficult for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire provided on 21 November, the fighting this week have reinforced the strength of supporters on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront having forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.</seg>
<seg id="14">Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most overcrowded and impoverished corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other party of the Palestine currently hands their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that the time is their ally.</seg>
<seg id="17">The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas is rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, is for Hamas; as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of Golf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Hamas members gloat and say that the growing Islamist curve around Israel, Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia in the north, where dominance, from Syria, where the rebels to the Islamist trend may reverse Bashar Al-Assad, and Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily to public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player which can not be excluded even by America and Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, supporters of the hardline Israel draw opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas has been handed over in the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and of many Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will able to sleep at night over a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, America renews its support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas to be the origin of the latest wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Above all, Israel has prospered, including under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including by the separation barrier, which encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with a more hawkish party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of January 22, a beautiful party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil those pesky Palestinian in giving them a state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they run the West Bank, would they not rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is preferable to keep them behind the wall and hit as soon as they leave the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may that the Arab Spring changes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if Islamists took power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority is to tackle the problems in their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Israel defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the local superpower will not new Arab governments to fix their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes well for the future -- and could mark the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should also think about the future.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world that is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel -- a bit like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression weakens already democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographics exacerbates this problem to the extent that the Arab population is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years for Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The two sides need to be driven by those outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people found by each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of the territory by Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">A small hope, and short-term, is that the ceasefire will outsiders to defend this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which must now work to put an end to the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.</seg>
<seg id="49">This contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state next to a state proposal to the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has a vested interest that Israel agrees to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he has not submitted his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">To return to the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is a very narrow vision.</seg>
<seg id="54">The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is done by a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">The laws for neutral packages of cigarettes came into effect in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the mark</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This Act entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Outside of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the most strict regime in the world of packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government has stated that the objective was to discourage smoking among youth in removing any representation glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, 99% of opportunity that they ever begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their image," said federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children with the crown of a logo to a princess."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would black market trade, which will facilitate access to cheaper cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others have said that this law had boosted their activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Zico Ha Import Pty Ltd., a small family business, said that the application of cigarette cases, including silicone mask horrific packaging, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is pending renewal of the stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, business is good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, the sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide tobacco marketing of cigarettes, is now available online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has prohibited the advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it can not prevent foreign sites do.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have no more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the hotspot by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman has noticed an increase of some contributions of ordinary people in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">We must ask ourselves whether it is a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and is the penalty to a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry is focused on the new regulation into force rather than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice -- these countries reported to WHO that the trade is at an unfair disadvantage, although none of these countries has had significant trading with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A decision of the WTO should be taken in the course of the year 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning pictures on packs in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to those photos.</seg>
<seg id="32">The photos do not bother me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I know them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"You take a cigarette and you ranges the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package which contained a photo of tumors of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, it is my little girl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the consistency of packaging made difficult the stowage of packages on display.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now, I need four hours," said Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government had to prohibit them once and for all and we said OK, it is good, stop and put the key under the door," he said, lifting his hands.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, as our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">Therefore, I have had sufficient time to consider the theme of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Skip a half-day in an airport for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract yourself (without forget duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But increasingly, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child are the praise of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is perfectly normal for us -- and our children -- bored from time to time, they say.</seg>
<seg id="8">This forces the brain to borrow interesting paths, even feed creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types of screens, we know more than the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So should we welcome boredom with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First of all, like many people, I thought that the problem was a rather recent phenomenon, particularly since we have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the case, said Peter Toohey, a Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The problem goes back to far," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Then there was the definition that we give to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed various different ways," said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After numerous publications and submitted the idea to a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is "to do something, but to engage in an activity."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task though it would like.</seg>
<seg id="22">With the apathy, he says, there do not want to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the process, with a low mood and the sense that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The problem may look like a depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or of the world, while depressed persons believe that the problem of them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes, we think that we bored while it is in fact a problem of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the framework of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified a more former experience in which participants were listening on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard, from the side room, the sound too high of a TV that had no report, others have just heard the TV, and the third group did not of course the soundtrack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more bored than the other two groups -- they struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you try to focus on a difficult task or ownership, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you make a boring task," such as watch objects on an assembly line, the music can help you do not get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, now, we know that when it wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children who are authorized to gigoter learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We've all at one time or another -- the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly boring film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more likely to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have the time to do everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have particular need of many and varied pacing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in the individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which it contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents from seven to eight times a day via a beeper.</seg>
<seg id="41">It noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their duties to the home, while 23 percent reported bored when they were not at school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In contrast, 3 per cent of parents reported being bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of today's boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he added that he knew that "Adolescence is a period where boredom reached its highest level," because, in particular children and adolescents do not have a lot of control on what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If I based my question: the boredom he is good for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes, as in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity," said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"The problem is the way that the brain found to inform you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N. Y. U.S..</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cook, make your happiness.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you look at the TV, it makes you happy in the short term, but not the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it will no longer, but it has not learned to handle alone or if autorégler, Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another," he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that we should glorify boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Like I do not think that we should criticize.</seg>
<seg id="57">Feeling comfortable outside of constant excitement that generate activities and the technology is the goal towards which we should strive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We need to get bored more often, but the problem is acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to him, what people want, it is a means to disconnect and enjoy downtime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."</seg>

<seg id="7">During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more than that of the law of the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without result.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police stopped charging adults age 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors who are in more conservative districts in Colorado have called to speed up existing marijuana business and continue to charge people who have.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the sale of licensed marijuana stores opening by the State in their neighborhoods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Things are changing so rapidly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, the Aurora police chief, to the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Washington State regulators are also quite a few questions.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are seeking guidance on how to install a system of permits, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell -- before the target date of December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead in most states in the regulations on marijuana, firstly on the therapeutic use exemptions and now with regard to personal use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.</seg>
<seg id="17">But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can not do more than suggest what works.</seg>
<seg id="18">"No real precedent on which we base ourselves, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Law of Washington, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which leaves a vacuum of a year, during which the system of permits will be still, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the rule that ensures appropriate access to marijuana and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or a nursery.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"will not be made more difficult places that urban areas to install a licensed trade sale of cannabis, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the Centre of the legalization of cannabis, a research group recently formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, the head of the police, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (prosecutor) would more people over the age of 21 who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop to charge people for this type of offence", with immediate effect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police would new judicial decisions which regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At Weld County in northern Colorado, the district attorney" (the Prosecutor of the Republic) Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office would handle cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on users for their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment, 119 persons are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the obligation to initiate a prosecution against these people who have committed an offence who, at the time, was a recognized offence," said Mr Buck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of the limited use of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer appear in adults for possession of limited amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The representative of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all cases of possession of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not have the impression I was wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, provide a legal framework and appropriate government to personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"It is a cultural barrier" with the Department of Public Prosecutions, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of laws on marijuana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, have also struggled to accept that it is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to address the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, the Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While defenders and representatives of the State to provide a new frontier of legalized sales, they expect the guidelines with concern and the culture of the federal government, which still sees the sale of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Department of Justice will.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has primarily commercial sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While it is true that the police will probably not push doors to small sachets of drugs, it was probably that it opposes the sale of marijuana for personal use to registered businesses authorized by new legislation," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser of the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In many cities of the Colorado federal authorities did not act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is that a delay of a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should ban next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want us in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community has voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">Our interest in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the State.</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions arise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I've been bullied and excluded Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As far as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and my older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, tolerance and free thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, two weeks after I installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper has alleged that I left university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the bedroom next to mine.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A. N. Wilson said with facetious I party after having been forced to drink in the chipped mugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I fled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and made the subject of constant bullying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my name rather heavy-handed, or due to the fact that I came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have been persecuted for a reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I have been the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advice of Margaret Thatcher and I partisan of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why mention this today, you might say.</seg>
<seg id="16">And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students undergo the same type of persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The increased hatred and institutionalized Tory students to Oxford is such that the last week, some of them demanded a protection of their rights, the same as those of gays, of people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The conservative members of the Chamber of the Corpus Christi College students (CREB) declared that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university for the equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, ITS and Right") devoted to politics among university students, and portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It discovered including student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", which moves in the Rolls-Royce, wears a full silver and travels with a cane to head the chrome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, students, curators say, be treated as scapegoats of the introduction of higher tuition fees."</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," said to a Sunday newspaper that there was a growing left bias in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People think that we as the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the JCR in regard to persons who are members of the centre-right.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am coming in September 1986, I was the age of 18 years and a crippling shyness.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher -- a former student an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding of higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere was charged of Stalinist vibrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">From the first days of the week, when the new students acquainted with other teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the teachers were not only to sarcasm toward students Tory, but, they were fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It was as if the policy regarding juvenile strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first sarcasm I was a French translation of texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased)" please translate the first paragraph"</seg>
<seg id="37">I have lost foot.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a little man in the face of pustular, won easily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Is that the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students laughed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The tears me burning eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest you take French courses during your free time, finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he said of a truculent tone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I am back in my room, inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="44">At dinner that evening, I am sitting alone and then I felt a light slap on my shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a student in second grade English, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said, gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">I fear so be it.</seg>
<seg id="48">Any person suspected to be a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it is even harder for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majority of young Tory claim be Labor (Labor).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, at the local pub, I carelessly tried to hide myself.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This scheme has failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student in the first year of philosophy, political science and economics that, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You're contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students have taken up the refrain.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverted, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How the Tories are they love?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59">They hurt each other, isn't it?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt as homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">Do I only could lead a normal life at Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Had I been forced to meet people sharing similar views only after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I had become Labor and deny my views?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years would look like in a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only one professor openly Tory Norman Stone, professor of modern history, which was taught in my university.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was detested not only because it was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was almost never there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated this insignificant and provincial location, as well as its accession to the point of view marxiste-déterministe history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a position of professor at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not happy here," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and London home of my parents, finding refuge with my family and my friends more open-minded city dwellers.</seg>
<seg id="72">I said to my father that I hated Oxford and explained why.</seg>
<seg id="73">It was disbelief.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.</seg>
<seg id="76">They wouldn't do it, not in the city of spires dreamers.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends communists had impeccable manners.</seg>
<seg id="78">He had tears in their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="79">Let them a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that it is to tease you.</seg>
<seg id="81">This break the heart if you left Oxford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance, progressively worsened.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and withdrew to its beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a meeting of work the following week, when another history professor suggested seriously, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Rougissant internally of shame, I admitted to be the victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the traitai "old crazy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I am still conjuring in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors have abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed my bag and I took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I am never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You treat me chicken pleurnicharde.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no child under 18 years of age should not be a victim of such intimidation in a school.</seg>
<seg id="95">The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only produced first 14 Tory ministers, but also an unshakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Valentino prefers the elegance of reputation"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the framework of the "Valentino: Master of Couture" exhibition, opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital fit to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The designer was recognized at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a prestigious retrospective which brings together more than 130 haute couture models established for its design house over the past 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I love this house," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This exhibition is the centrepiece of a story which is the only player" he signore" lengths, but which could not be written without his famous clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always been fascinated by the world and to share the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, from the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino expose memorabilia such as his trophies of upward social mobility: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.</seg>

<seg id="14">"We adorions all be invited in his Gstaad chalet", says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friend of the beauties of the time as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino has always preferred the elegance, prestige.</seg>
<seg id="16">And even so, it is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, a model Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Argentine dummy, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at her apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr..</seg>
<seg id="21">It saw and felt his spirit in every detail of her apartment, in the décor, the food, the music.</seg>
<seg id="22">"With him, every guest feel important and valued", recalls the "top model", which has started to work with him during the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.</seg>

<seg id="27">A gallery of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of sixty meters wide which proposes exchanging roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must scroll down on the podium to admire the "public" dream on key creations of Valentino, as the cutter that Jackie Kennedy had chosen the dress for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, was Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a jacket in wool and fur belonged to Empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of that audience of mannequins, include names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or the Habsburg Sophie.</seg>

<seg id="39">Finally, it was possible to the end of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard Line.</seg>

<seg id="42">"It was a dream come true," said the widow of the Arenberg Rodrigue.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent to the mode, he is obsessed by the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Princess d'Arenberg retains the designer evening dresses with "the utmost care, because a gown is not just a dress, it is also all the memories associated with it."</seg>

<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society clients."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Obnubilé for years by the "soft skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy) Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion of Honour, lengths has as many honors that any spouse of its clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"His refinement, its quiet, careful and perfect aspect I have always jumped eyes", recognizes the Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euro, holders of Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilograms of sulphur through the rugged stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Some people for whom the work is a hell and other working literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Anto Wijaya, a 400 juveniles who earn their living on the volcano's sulfur Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth to solidify on contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After harvesting of large rocks of sulphur, which weigh nearly 70 pounds in total, he moved in two bamboo baskets it on his shoulders through the rugged trails.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has just 250 metres up to the top of the volcano that rises to 2.386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, like a turtle, bearing in mind the balance and measuring their not not to trip and fall into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that a mistake could cost them the life, as happened to a French tourist who took a fatal fall in Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Ijen Kawah miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur extract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, there are emerging among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully baskets, walking the 3 km until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below 850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">These PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, arguably, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry as it is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture of cosmetics, candles, fireworks, dynamite and even used to launder the sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As we move about 70 kilograms, about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips per day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each takes him 3 hours and he exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (EUR 11.50) at the end of the day.</seg>

<seg id="16">"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (€ 167)," said the holder who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€ 6.20) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto is income near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, which for one reason, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: "I married a young girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java for that she convert to Islam."</seg>

<seg id="18">Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gas.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started to pay the bill although he covers the face with a mask and special gloves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas emitted by the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.</seg>

<seg id="23">Malmené by this young, friendly and intelligent life could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">It shares a hovel of substandard wood with other carriers, rises each day to two hours of the morning as the sulphur has not stopped up the night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and shining in the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the darkness, illuminating Anto descends in the crater with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, that it has bought itself with its own money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 patients are baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company did not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who are self-employed and are paid to weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, they are not a subject of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) that natural park guards charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is done for animals, not humans," protested Madrusin, a portly holder of 42 years who works at the Ijen Kawah for 30 years, since he left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable of up to 110 kilograms, it ensures that it will not work" as it can," because it is in need of money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">While the sulphur damaging the throat and eye irritation when the tide is turning and trap miners in thick columns of smoke from the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complained of suffering serious illness ... plus, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of baskets.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">In balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only entrust 50 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="34">Each day, his companions and extract him 15 tonnes of sulphur of the volcano, three trucks carrying to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 km away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not retire, I will die here as the volcano is all my life," says Unainik in opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The eldest of five children, aged 30, also works as a holder of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">As time passes, but poverty perpetuates one of the most difficult crafts from generation to generation in the world: the human mules of the volcano are Kawah ljen.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem unlikely that these words are an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube to Singapore at the beginning of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lyrics from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put an open secret in the drawer" mocked the birth rate of Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of the video, hopes to attract the attention on the problem in a fun way, thanks to that advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfil their national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is intended only to the Internet, we could make an entertaining and fun.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the main problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the field of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a theme that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried several things as launch of pheromone perfume or organize evenings of speed-dating.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were creative but they have not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we said the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem in a rap song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Government of Singapore does not take lightly.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends $300 US per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A measure of the Government in favor of marriage and fathers up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distribution of tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city-state rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was above 2, considered as the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, policy director of the marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of objectives and priorities of life beyond the marriage and of family formation," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These social changes have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, the result of a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy designed to drastically increase immigration to counter the decline of the population has created resentment within the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore found Web sites with a barely disguised xenophobia against immigrants, particularly toward the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore last year its worst election results since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Consequences inespérées</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, income tax, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authorities in urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of "shoe box", may be constructed in specific areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have a surface area of 46 square metres and their very successful sale.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a style of life and discourage developers seeking to build larger family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, said that its "shoe boxes" are much more quickly than larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense where such housing is built much more quickly than those of larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new standards provide better guidance to proponents, who was previously in the way if they wanted to offer too small housing units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If both is that these new regulations may be a step towards the increase of the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would appear that they did not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, as well as education, it is for this that people give to later," said a young executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young 20s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The men and women mentioned their careers, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons to prevent them having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Thus, while the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans are themselves who have the last word.</seg>

<seg id="8">In four cases, they associate the term "something very personal" and "the password and user name "when they have applied to social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"I do not going my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account over the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This are highly classified secrets, my mother can know but not everyone," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On FB, I post of nice images or games.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also discussed with my friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I do not share one of my photos or of someone who would fool," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge ensures that it knows its 35 friends on FB as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the family.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets.</seg>

<seg id="21">It argues that it never requested an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">It will not trust someone who recommend him a foreigner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of José, 14 years old, is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, it does not know 20 people listed on his list of friends.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It didn't bother me because we have something in common, the music for example," he said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Key Questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, an English teacher and Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras said Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the book "Native and digital immigrants", uses those words to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives, they, the children and young people who are born with the technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We, we're the digital immigrants who must teach there, while we ourselves is learning," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It adds that the issue is complex, "because we have a set on what is right or not disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so".</seg>
<seg id="46">"We ask them also to be selective when what matters to them most is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert, the confidentiality of the most effective way to teach children and adolescents is to use questions that make you think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them not to do so is useless," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Secondly, Porras lists some examples: there are things that you do not telling to a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, would you like it they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you what others publish on you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you identifies photos of celebrations, requests you to other persons permission to identify them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And also, everyone needs to know what you're doing at any moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, and other principles of morality, it must be the same on social networks," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Monitoring</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">In each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing the implications of the opening of an account with their children on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age and that it is permitted to share or publish," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Guard, it is essential to remind children that he should not talk to strangers.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">Correa said that the solution of a grant of asylum to Assange since the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the attribution of a safe conduct which it would visit the country, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and it emphasizes that it has had discussions in London to find a solution to the detention of the WikiLeaks founder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European bodies," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And he believes that "if Britain granted safe conduct as soon as tomorrow, it would."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in Ecuador Embassy in London, or being interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said it was not that it was "the poor, the bad faith and lies which affect freedom of expression".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemy of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists to the balance of the greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this context, it welcomed that it is not this kind of journalists" or bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries which dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than to his re-election," he would track and trace the path of the revolution to continue".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup attempts in disguise", since in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What is more, the president of Ecuador considers as "completely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundary between the two countries by means of the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which enhance Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the time being, this judgment is not respected.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a problem between a country in South America and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It must resolve them in their set to overtake them and move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the same time, it is confident in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and it said that it is "beneficial that Latin America up international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment so strong it is."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to seek a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity" with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa has ascertained that, if he lost the primary in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but also unfair situations as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can not resolve by means of political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement believed that it was me who did this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I won, this would be my last presidential term and I then withdraw from political life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, I will also.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This is my decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa has also referred to new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, to Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just discussed with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"This is not a relapse of the state of health of President Chavez," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended in an appeal to greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the results of the test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is as if the sky had fallen on the head," he said in reference to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to "less onerous", in vain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man hid in his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has decided to take one of her illness and has started to inquire about her and his stubbornness was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG) -- in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio resides with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubts, the stigma of treatment options, and more.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to say goodbye" because it was speechless."</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignoring their illness, many people are still where the virus has already caused damage," exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is now that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes as its reference point that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The infectious and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those consuming not drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4 count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis to 25 years," as it remains under control, will live up to 75 years without problems," said the scientist interviewed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To put this in context, you need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While it is true that the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died as a result of AIDS from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS) but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients identified on the basis of national data are deceased.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nothing that Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there, in 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So why is there still deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">I think that the problem is not access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is like this that I see, it is what has happened in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the past 12 years at least, we have never failed, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they did not know they are infected, or when they learn at advanced stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It gives us an indisputable fact" nine in ten patients arrive when they are already an opportunistic infection, you need to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, it is to achieve more early diagnoses and, for this, we need suggestions of mass screening tests, to all those who apply."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The AIDS prevention specialists and members of the Council of State of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who was to test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he already was the holder of the AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is the common complication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some believe that they will die and not know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke out three times a week," they say, this is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change has been beneficial, I eat well, exercise, I take my medication.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, only parents know that he suffers from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I have a normal life as anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I have an active sex life, but as I paid attention to me and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid now, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they have the diagnosis, he must know that we can live like everyone else, in being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The condoms on the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It has many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the more lies in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In all sites dedicated to it," it actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we give 100 packages, it is very well, but in the past, some do not have access to condoms," he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections, found adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The question: "What are you going to?," asked sarcastically and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents did not want to hear, the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="39">It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold counters, but found in public toilets distributors and in locations that youth frequent.</seg>
<seg id="40">This does not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not more of their pay girls and the motel, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded when asked if there is a distribution of condoms within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not as sexuality, works best is to provide condoms to persons already sexually active," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The figures in Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It identifies 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 1.317 of HIV and AIDS).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The State is the fourth State of the countries in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of those infected with HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of infections are through sex, blood 6% and 2% by the perinatal route.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">A judgement ratified the appeal by a court in the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group provided Vitro via a bankrupt business in Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all National Societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and with problems of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems therefore that survival procedures of Mexican companies authorized by the laws are not valid in the country to the stars, to the international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaving Mexican companies without the possibility of embargo defense of their properties beyond the Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution will enable the main manufacturer of glass of Mexico to the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First, while the judge in the case said that creditors are required to register under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would denounce the cooperation of the international procedure in case of insolvency of companies having a transnational profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, the United Nations Model Law the Uniformity of the Law for International Trade had been established to this end by the American Law Institute as arbitrator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgement established that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, by debts of Vitro subsidiaries to the parent, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">There by half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Swiss Federal Institute of Business Bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, what is certain is that, as the votes of subsidiaries in all ways Vitro creditors who fought against it in U.S. courts, i.e. "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, have not achieved the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been 45 votes for and 37 against.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A given omitted by the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, affecting the cost to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For the moment, the society of the González family Sada appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, it is to say with five judges, because only three had voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The use of insurance will the non-prospérité and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro was detailed in the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, noting that the release of the conventions signed by the two countries for the same level as in paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In addition, it noted that the country is folded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency proceedings, ensure equity for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Multi-vehicle of two parties: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="22">Complaints of trade unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation at the against the ex-patron society, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Trade Unions of Pilots Aviateurs has already encountered problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="29">As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the products of the countries of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The globe-trotting basketball" Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, through him, has traveled around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few of the people of Puerto Rico to have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The reason is that before that brain hemorrhage condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, that this is as a player from the lower leagues, the national team of basketball player, manager and leader of the national team, the NSO, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I've worn several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even more in the same time, as when I was President of OBS, Director General of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his wife of more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball is my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate when he made this assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated of photos and memories that remind its route out standards, bear witness to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In all his memories, he loved the most are those who remind him its passage as a player in the team of Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"This has been my best years, those which I have the most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships of Vaqueros from 1967, as manager, co-manager or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is many years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy is entered in the team of the NSO.</seg>
<seg id="14">From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: "I have a big player for you, it measures two metres.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want to?"</seg>
<seg id="17">It has happened that starting Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow was then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember he said that if Mincy had permits to Bayamon win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It welcomed the championship of Vaqueros with Gausse, but only to distance as in 1988 it was already the big brother of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there was the 4th 1990 World, where we are and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had we not play the last game," said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team of the 1990 World is the best national team that you have to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is part of the best, like that which has beaten the Dream Team at the Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have put a beating to the United States team, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León brothers Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not attend the World 90 due to a knee problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the Pan American Games imbroglio of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, it is of Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its statistics at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best leader Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">In young people, I like very much the work that Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Be part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains to be done?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There was things that I wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example that Ponce boys play only in their area and only national teams of other parts of the island during the play-off.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, young people traveling and play too much then that this is not necessarily required.</seg>
<seg id="45">I at least have the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">This makes me happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course, I like the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A course on the "End of the world" has just begun</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, the zombies, germs and viruses and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This six-month period, when religion professor Stuart Charmed decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was there an irresistible hook: the end of "countdown" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which many people as the proof of the imminent end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Professor Charmed had no idea of what awaited them in the coming months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal hole that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of the debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of the time thought that trigger the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I am not realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic half that I have ever known," said this week the Charmed professor to his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If on analysis of what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we told, this was a very good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the only professor to give courses this semester on "the end of the world", which will, in theory, the last of the story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption" Media, Culture and the end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, the zombies, germs and viruses and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze it because those ideas grow with time," he said, and the manner in which they provide hypothetical scenarios some guide human conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real life examples.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell my students on what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, the Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed to provide a course simply entitled "The end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to deliver the course again, in case the world disparaitrait not," said Professor Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "disaster", students must study, develop projects and spending their final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the State of Pennsylvania, the final review will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which no other student choice to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The course proved quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for students of high level, composed of 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received messages by electronic mail several weeks before the start of the semester, the part of the people who asked if there was room to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It fascinates me to see what people are capable of comforting themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, originating from Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Medical center of 25 years, stated that it viewed all apocalyptic films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I had never heard of a course that taught this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I appreciate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students surveyed, and still less a teacher, said we believe in the world's end date of December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," said Julie zegle, final year student at Temple, aged 21 and originating from West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused a surge of such speculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other parts of the world, people do not believe this," he says.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is the majority in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle which gives the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that here were courses on "the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines are not the end of the world," nous-a replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall noted that over the years, it has been referred to many expected dates of judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think the next date" or to philosophize on the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers took the day lightly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several told us that they go to parties" of the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Sometimes, I called friends and we rigolons together," said Samira Ford, student in communications of 20 years.</seg>
