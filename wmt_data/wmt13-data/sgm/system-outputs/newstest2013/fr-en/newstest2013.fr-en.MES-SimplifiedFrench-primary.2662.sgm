<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Republican leaders condoned their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Brennan sees it as a myth, saying that the electoral fraud is increasingly rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: the new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon gained momentum after the elections in November 2010 which saw will add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that voters show photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on election day and withdraw citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo identification card.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities clamoured to extend this to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they are its sponsors bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card as the map of the insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, does not have a photo ID cards issued by a government agency of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a piece of identification.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, it often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain the identity card required.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with photo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Much more.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, voters considered voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, these same States allow members of fishing clubs or hunting who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no State demanded proof of citizenship for voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Moreover, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing registration of voters on election day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not inconsequential.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns have helped to save about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the measures adopted since 2009 has fallen 17 percent the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the same with Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">They accounted for only 11 percent of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In return, the whites who formed 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of the electorate voting in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the law's most controversial.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see this as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: the new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to undergo screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and have firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, European, concluded in a difference of mortality among patients who have been screened and those who had not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have the cancer if it is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had cancer of the prostate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The African-American men are also at increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and others who are slow.</seg>
<seg id="13">We really need to understand the patient the riskiness of his cancer, with the possible options, not treating necessarily the prostate cancers that do not affect the life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who have detects cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will suggest the active monitoring and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, it is precisely the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I therefore recommend to pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if it should go or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In collaboration with the International Society of urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe for preventing cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody smoked, this rate increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several also remain totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This night enormously to people's health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deplores the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The overweight and obesity also foster the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.</seg>
<seg id="36">They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against cancer of the colon," nutrients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The sausages, too, and they should be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat by smoking, curing or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it was suggested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their research, however, are not conclusive at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D on breast cancer is not clear either.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with her doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Spend a screening test, it does not give the cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs kernels</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then, is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is authentic Ramsis particle, and that it is very much like the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data released this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be perfectly clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world, a law must inevitably that two things cannot get to the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that she, too, such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">From there, the particle physicists fall into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely to obey the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in another move the bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least, not for this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place, at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, Laboratoires Berkeley: the mesons, that we cannot tackle here, and "particles of force," by which the large forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs would somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons-là, it must be pointed out, are not all exotic critters also than you might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson wondrous banality: the photon, or particle of light, "which is the" messenger "of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge up or change of direction, this "disturbed" the electromagnetic field in this area, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "disturbance" was born an electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.), and the wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus, one of the bosons "bearers of force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is the same with the Higgs, this is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" that this boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; pour l'exciter, there is very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond which only a very big rock could ride the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why we need a huge particle accelerator at CERN - such as the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 miles in circumference! - to achieve such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is more useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is indeed not all particles, or all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never himself on a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what does' can make "all this research, asked Ms. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any difference between the observations and predictions of the MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also more fervently hope that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and fill some holes.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must be said, still has a huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or dark matter, which form about 80% of the terms of the Universe (re-oups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But it has not found any such disparities at CERN until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The implications of this research in the lives of ordinary people, and they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, do not realize the revolution that their work would trigger.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first laser (the first continuous pulsed were, in 1962, at the outset the laser was seen as a "gimmick of lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And then, applications may also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, in the course of its work in perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although this was not at all its original intent, now serves as a "eye" in digital cameras of the world, and he won the 2009 Nobel Physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With his Commission to die with dignity, Quebec recently described the sensitive issue of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir tried to look more closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the region.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer who gnawed a respite for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They had given me five years to live, I made seven years ago," he said, one who was lying in his bed at the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, it could not be prepared for it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is his work: a huge weakness that makes it impossible to travel to the toilet, and even eating alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attablé before a delicious lunch, he agreed to leave help to eat, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageux, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are scrambling around him, give him his medication, offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that I will cure diarrhea, it is humiliating," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man, it pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Régresser at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the person's capacity to accept the regression," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to several people working in palliative care, of great moments are at the heart of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a prognosis of living up to three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them has consistently said "curative care."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is dying "conscious and stifled."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease made me discover my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," she says.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I no longer wishes in life," she says, before admitting that he poses a mask to help him breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">It expects all the same, in the next few days, a recent visit to his son Venu of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At Victor-Gadbois, we can offer, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and helps to food.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the palliative care, giving when there's nothing else to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the death penalty more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little when we know that we end up all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, "explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In the dying, it will provide care of mouth brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics will no longer be required to monitor their blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of daily life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, it was served a beer with Mr. X, died during the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, it is his son who completed the beer at the feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It helps the family as the patients," said Nathalie Savard, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At home, the Victor-Gadbois days.</seg>
<seg id="42">Alongside a 93-year-old man who is relishing his latest family assembly in the courtyard, good luck in its pillows while it is falling in her honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after all tried to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to hospice palliative care, which is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely this huge gap in health care that worried several doctors who specialize in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, a manifesto, signed palliative care experts including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Québec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has a right to palliative care quality before it agrees to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days to the emergency, in great pain, without that we take the necessary steps to relieve it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, several oncologists bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she abandoned a wrenching chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my oncologist that I arrêtais treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop to beat me, "she told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had told me I was finished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Not all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die thanked caretakers of not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment against the pain in 8 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors have so often use palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, sporadically, either permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I want you euthanasiiez" means "I want to be relieved."</seg>

<seg id="5">It is the scandal erupted in 2011, through a background investigation on embezzlement linked to contracts for road work in Quebec, in which the Liberal premier, Jean Charest, had agreed that backwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, occult financing of political parties and corrupt officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he noted, the Department of Transportation would have saved $1 billion on the contracts," some réfrénant their instincts to reach a share.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "has already brought down two mayors," ajoute-il, hoping that it gets to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals."</seg>

<seg id="9">A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also is working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most members of the squad "Hammer," which since 2009, were said to have led the cartel "sewer" of Montreal to put the pedal on the soft swell of contracts...</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent weeks, she has conducted searches in number and scope for fraud and corruption charges against city officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city suburb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected of having pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Are formally charged in addition to the road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It caused a sensation in explaining the mechanics of the "system of obtaining government contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who reversait money to the Union, the party of the Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr zambito sowed everyone winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to parties, especially the Liberal provincial then in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He also confessed to having organized a fundraiser for the legal ex-vice-premier Minister Nathalie Normandeau liberal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A sewer contracts which it inflated costs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system of corruption functioned smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles surprising ex-ingénieur, public works, has detailed well before the committee: in 10 years, it has received gifts of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736 000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts which it inflated costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials from the Highways admitted being grease the leg by 30% to 40% by false invoices extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then an organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel Outine budget coffers with dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials from Montreal to sound the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mayor of the district of Rivière, east of the island, it reacts as early as 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the real estate boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, it said that it "takes on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the rot and pinpoint wrongdoing."</seg>
<seg id="30">The process, she says, is "painful but positive."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but it should be an investigative unit to Montreal and a watch, not to see a return of dubious practices.</seg>
<seg id="32">As the household.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials aware of the scheme," when they don't trempaient in the politicking!</seg>
<seg id="35">Believing at 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to the parties, but it will not change the situation, he said: "as long as it is not confined strictly election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding of public contracts and financing of the parties: "you can't go lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec City and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own back yard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season, you took on a new scope with PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by an awareness of individuals, but also by the new dimension of the MTP.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I progress at their side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also contributed much.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, in a match, it is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is going very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not ignite.</seg>
<seg id="12">My debut at the center of formation of the INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I always put forward by levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">So you can take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruits this summer are accustomed to play games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every Downdrag is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is assisted by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the man of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect among all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience and has won many titles with posh clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will win other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation with him comforting.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I ran out of a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It gives me confidence that also explains my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What is your view on the first part of the season for PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our major goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final of 8es with the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to receive during the 8th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG could become a European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">It has already the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a European club, Paris needs to win titles and.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially Financial support, PSG has the means to make this happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In Ligue 1, not to win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, we were really keen to pocket the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season, it has not gone away.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very big season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be champion...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think this is the right.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you feel the media wait too.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and players we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">Did we agree completely.</seg>
<seg id="57">Later, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to blame us, of course it is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people expect more.</seg>
<seg id="59">You can never win 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to put in place a game project.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">It has been shown in the Champions League that we could respond now.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City that doesn't happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the final of 8es, they also made huge spending!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the light of the money invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead at the truce.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been inspired by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile and said that, despite all the difficulties, it has prevailed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much better than we say that there is a "Zlatan dependence."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and that it puts a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to that and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">He demonstrated wherever he went that he was a great player, a global star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the group, we respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the men he has around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This leads others to raise their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you lived the Euro 2012 with the French team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I was concerned to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from claw game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things there and I am emerged stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I can achieve good matches in selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I was hoping for my baptism for France.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and today must be exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What is your view on the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Lions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has the results for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.</seg>
<seg id="92">As was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want to make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">White had achieved its goal in qualifying for Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Lions in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The good zero (1-1) pulled, 16 October, Spain is a founding match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each has fought for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="99">Prior to this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the central banks, transactions identified and the costs of treatment between stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to the financial crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros) and a memorandum of secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 Transaktioner have already been made thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing very impressive, compared to the world trade in real currency or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">She describes as "the bitcoin virtual currency had the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as the "credits," used to move forward in a video game is won by playing or that one can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But every time a central authority and control trafficking trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin noeuds, all of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual-key cryptography.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged certainly exists in the book of public accounts, broadcast across the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of hash of file, i.e. transformation of a large file in a digital footprint shorter and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "are" the new transaction and he added a number before "chop" together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many digits.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number found, the other noeuds easily verify that this is the right.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, for defrauding, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are visible until the 100 millionth, which leaves scope...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the challenge is also noted for each increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">A Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stealing bitcoins in deposits.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The flaw used is not the protocol itself," said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency Bitcoin using the network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also mentioned the possibility of money laundering through this service anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash also has this defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">An actor as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, "giant" balances have been launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are less expensive.</seg>
<seg id="45">The carrier operates more its identity and can therefore be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement other merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">They need only communicate an address that a telephone can "photographed and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement of questioning of the hierarchical systems for systems more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point" per years, he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB, in his report, intended to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.</seg>

<seg id="4">NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is mostly Afghan peasants we punished by treating them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, and maimed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former Heads refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, as of the time of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by Pakistani jihadists, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik,.</seg>
<seg id="10">Toléré, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will also when the West will be more discreet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The departure of the French troops of the Nijrab base, that I have seen from the top of the hills planted almond thanks to French credits is in order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, the country on fire because of the fighting between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the organization of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former mujahideen, current Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main leaders of the Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have turned into the business of government land for resale in lots in the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge "subcontracting American contracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have discredited; most of them have not fought themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as will those who took advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the cities, the government schools are full, girls as boys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or corruption of some leaders.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everyone, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the TV, and his Turkish soap operas that have a modern world is followed everywhere.</seg>

<seg id="30">The army is now.</seg>
<seg id="31">The authorities, which will order it be regarded as legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">A former commanders of the Soviet struggle is already concern of provincial militias, which will escape the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be given a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform into a centralized State, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">No industry has been fadl en route, no dam is important, no irrigation system is repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is left to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The noise was pleased that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">This has only added to the sense that the West was to take them over.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to treat iron ore and copper on the ground, or by means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have already almost left for Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) search huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It also will one day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, restore normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The departure of French troops ended on 20 November.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support, the Delegation logic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009, to try to "win the hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, and is carried out by a small French NGO, many community service and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.</seg>
<seg id="48">This work, "local labour-intensive work, could help to contain the insurgency: wells, irrigation, drinking water, reforestation, trees, protection of the soil and increase the arable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As we remember that, after two billion euros of military spending?</seg>
<seg id="50">A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of local, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.</seg>
<seg id="51">The embassy has received dozens of requests made of small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.</seg>
<seg id="52">For that they disperse from the insurgency led by foreign groups, what farmers have told me, we should keep in their favour a small civilian assistance, well controlled and that affects them directly.</seg>

<seg id="8">For his opponents, President pushes ahead with his "autocratic style," continuing of "betraying its word" and "trample the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the side of his supporters, it ensures that this is a way to bring to an end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">A referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy, while the dispute raged across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although the resort to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers," supposedly expire after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the Liberals were missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing not having been able to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that the quorum is reached, 11 people, members, alternates were added in haste, yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not surprisingly, this is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some commentators are amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee considering that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was poorly regulated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was still in the process of being voted yesterday evening, 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Objects of attention, Article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace the "principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisie," replied the liberals, who see it as just a communication.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They include Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University in an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify the conformity of laws with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is worrisome because "people called a vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less than the current moderate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the moment, there is no specific religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not intellectuals and academics, some trained in the French system "temper Blouet Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledged that "there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrowed religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">Reference is made to the "fiqh" Islamic jurisprudence, including [ed].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question could arise in the future the extent of the civilian judges are competent to rule on it. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers it grants to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are considerably reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: the powers given to the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Council of defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nor will prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested the associations for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">They also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem hostage.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, freedom of the press in particular.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, no article does more to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not included in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president must speak yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The support of the head of state will be marching them Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="2">While the Members and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only purpose: to earn money to support their families back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and the retail sale.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, promised the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">He will have to validate their language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Are free only nationals of the country where the Russian has the status of an official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by this law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Profit, negative attitude and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of the friendship of the peoples, the State University of Moscow, Saint Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants can pass the exams in cities across the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This initiative to introduce exams was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, before the law comes into force, the human rights activists have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what is it going to give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What is the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and immigrants?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Firstly, the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of rights must begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of selection organized will solve the problems at 90% of the foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, future migrant is intended to encounter dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "trip" in a crowded house where he and dozens of others are tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and must work between 12 and 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected wage," confirms the Chief Executive Officer of the migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I do not stop, the police!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, many of the republics of Central Asia who want to earn money in Russia that they do not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair.</seg>
<seg id="30">Indeed, their families have not even enough to feed their children without speaking to dress properly and to equip them for the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave earn money when the opportunity arises.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult when you don't know the language they hand over a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel diminished and undermined."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Defenders of Human Rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language.</seg>
<seg id="35">The reviews will be designed solely to migrants who have a legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">Without status, there will be no review or official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome to enter or defence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many immigrants explained that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason? administrative barriers and language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And then, you may get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we do not have to register, where cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," confided to reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I quickly, without skimping achète-toi and a beautiful work of art."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">From the first day of the entry into force of the law relating to the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several false certificates of examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="48">The falsified papers out of a common colour printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The representatives of the power and the defenders of human rights to agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."</seg>
<seg id="52">The authorities can give migrant workers who were unable to validate the review of the first blow the time for language.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve to actively communicate with people.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The share of crimes involving illegal weapons is very low</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against holders of civilian firearms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Such is the reaction of the authorities in response to recent incidents: that there be performed at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The police wants to ban the carrying of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a permit to carry a weapon from 18 to 21 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea was supported by the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced to the State Duma soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screws."</seg>
<seg id="8">An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centers of fire, demand to abandon "this senseless."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, told the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on civilian weapons will not deter criminals to supply to the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to them, you can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">However, the Ministry of Interior says that he control the dissemination of illegal weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from the factory to the officer</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The black market of weapons is provided through multiple channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main channels are number five, "says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Headquarters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Capture of screen from a site taking orders of weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first is "on track," i.e. weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," said Baranets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the police.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explains that these weapons stolen in the stocks of the police as those stolen directly to the representatives of the security forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The illegal guns go on sale since the military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many of these have often suffered explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"A certified versions indicate that some of the fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit," says the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"We see private weapons plants that cannot compete with the competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said one expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">An important part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is a local artisanal production, sometimes, a mafia was formed and organizes the supply," says the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where are the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on the issue was formed in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data portals relating to weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, explained the researchers, comes from the army and the police.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of the weapons on the black market has recovered "by lack of employees whose work is related to weapons," it was suggested in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal excavations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A salesman and a gun store consultant who asked to remain anonymous ensures that long ago nobody buys weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine searches; they are too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="39">The person purchases through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.</seg>
<seg id="40">It also delivers the goods by a screen.</seg>
<seg id="41">"He carries it in town and sells it for 900 €per unit with two magazines," he says.</seg>

<seg id="48">To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust it.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are sellers on the market, but there must also come by saying for example "on the part of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">United States: the employees of the fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nearly a quarter of the American teenagers go through a cashier's job at McDonald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against low salaries by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will gain or lose steam quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations of the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time that the modest wages received by the employees of basis with Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of the protests seek the establishment of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," when a barrage of rain balances grabbing million inhabitants has befallen America and sometimes triggering clashes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organize pickets with the trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are aimed at consumers of modest and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything: the layers of hunting rifles from a car battery, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products are on average 8% to 27% less than the major supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is why many of poorly paid workers with Walmart shop solely on their place of work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The price and the choice of products made of Walmart of one of the most powerful in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap partly because of low wages of its employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example of the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the events of the "Black Friday" demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the basic wage with Walmart, which affects $9.5 percent of the time, this is a sum that he cannot afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart transferred all wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would be tantamount to 46 cents.</seg>
<seg id="22">They will spend in only one year 12,39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and have brought no harm to the group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am the night at midnight the following day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">His funds have performed in all 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post that left at all "less than five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was only an "operation of com 'among many others" on the part of the union organizer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Following Customer!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests have continued this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they did not even give you for sick leave and don't pay the work you have done honestly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and New York is $7.25 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food to increase with time, but little, on average employees Commodity- affect New York $8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody affects less than them in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time where almost a quarter of the American teenagers working at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Today, I find myself to interview employees of McDonald's who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, on the board of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also sought to set up trade unions in the sector of the fast food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prohibits the administration of impeding and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.</seg>
<seg id="43">For the union, seize the fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the key is the extraordinary staff rotation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They disagree</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Another tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the protest was the rally in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they did not even give you for sick leave and don't pay the work you have done honestly!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support the employees of the fast food for that they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important sector of the fast food throughout its history.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people attended without counting that not all were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For the moment, it only happens moderately to fool the brain"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Recently, the fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the outset, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November we heard that Microsoft had applied for the patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, it appears from the interview with the director of the group of 3D interactive technologies from the laboratory Microsoft of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by the creation of virtual spaces open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The whole of humanity has remained at the pixels on screen TVs and sometimes tactile.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in order by the gesture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What we also reserves the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, many things unfold on screen TVs, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that and we are truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technologies.</seg>
<seg id="15">It should get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think of voice commands?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is appreciated, but not overstated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">We cannot say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we don't always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought with gestures, not broad gestures, but rather small, discrete gestures.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- That is to say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how would you spend this who can?</seg>
<seg id="29">You would with words and gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I spoke only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at a particular moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I believe that very soon we will have to work for the development of new types of sensors that enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you don't like in the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">They lack depth resolution, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, it is on the current generation that we use in our work on the 3D recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get around 8-megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c / s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds to the designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must bear in mind the resolution in the X and Y axis, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Speed is too much, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c / s aren't really, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave a touch sensors Ougiya delay treatment between 1 and 100 μs current sensors, being closer to the second value (60).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would need a device of this type in my work, but does not require, for having more executives in the second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- But we not increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect now has three cameras, "one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the returned signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third is in fact a camera sensor of the field visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to define the depth of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">Many cameras could solve this problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or it worse by increasing the volume required of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As many as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Don't you think of a point of view of the daily use of the technologies of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality you would from a cloud computing platform of the glasses in the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a very personal and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those that only you see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses from will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the handling of the virtual Elementary objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group anticipates compared to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my course, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth could very well be the addition of the tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the moment, one of the interesting is the use of second hand to serve as a basis of image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It captures perfectly the pressures!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also some technologies that are really intended to assign palpabilité to these images "in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed to a point where the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of fresh air on the ends of the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also the bracelets worn on the wrist that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with the prospects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- And you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is still a task on which today it will still take a long time to give the wrong: how to convince someone who is physically in a very short space walk in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also of the giant balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">For the moment, it only happens moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The reign of the taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the project "the Petersburg vanguard" dedicated to the people who are in advance, to the forefront of culture and art.</seg>
<seg id="3">This list ultra-sélectif has already hosted prominent players in the art scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, all dressed in red that we may encounter near the Russian Museum, been or at parties and openings connected.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tables of Kirill Miller still gather crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is one of the St. Petersburg storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the vanguard St. Petersburg branch of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and puts in a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of its existence, its philosophy and its image of a bohemian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why do you go about the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> I chose the red as dressmaker specializing in appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if in society, everything that is not gray raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="16">The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - And when you understood that you had to be a painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - At the exhibition in the Cultural Palace Nevskiy the whereabouts of my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood that this was my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then, the wave of the old unofficial painters and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there has been no wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm interested in the theater, fashion, music, all kinds except the words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - it was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I have taken place at Pouchkinskaya-10 that housed before the club work a musical and artistic, bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born: the NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's ear."</seg>
<seg id="26">Chnour and his friends sang songs easy for playback in tight shirts, they were among them, composer Igor Vdovin today.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began to occur in live, he became "Leningrad."</seg>
<seg id="28">Trakhtenberg fired not hurting emissions before the time of Hali Gali.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is that they are received.</seg>
<seg id="30">"D137 Interviews," Club "Griboedov": what are the implications of the artistic Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">Our employees are party as accustomed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the price "the personalities of our city."</seg>
<seg id="34">I was appointed "painter of the year," and it was then that my reign ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not convenient to work in a new era with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currency and acuity.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm having an exhibition scheduled "the Russian museum across the clowns."</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns belong to a class time.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and scary to be so.</seg>
<seg id="42">But with the clowns, all fades, the tragic falls.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the idea of saving the world via the total disguise and mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, it is the habit is important, we are looking at the external mechanism, but not inside the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">Maybe we can't give him a hand, but that it should instead be spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And lies will be erased by the disguise.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="48"> - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - a cultural city must have this kind of hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who else can play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Perhaps that commercial art can also be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Today the commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet wines.</seg>
<seg id="52">The disintegration of the culture is underway.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the Dumb another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a ticket of $100 to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today, we need to think about who you're liking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Each star has 100 fans.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="59"> - These are people that we have had to come see, this is the sexual and social side that works.</seg>
<seg id="60">But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, all declined.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them not to spoil the experience.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the tables that usually are those painted at the end of life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, we often confuse the ideas.</seg>
<seg id="65">It said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money for the painting.</seg>

<seg id="72">But all may not work in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Currently, this is the "reign of taste" which blooms.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="80">And on our stones, art has struggled to grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil and we have more writers and readers, this is bad.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are many people who will see exhibitions, concerts.</seg>

<seg id="4">A caravan of space shuttles with earthlings aboard in search of a planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save humanity, a big question arises: how to keep our species in weightlessness or on a planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I believe that there are not a lot of choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are in fact two true planets that we can win, not even as a hypothesis.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">If the conditions on Mars are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.</seg>
<seg id="10">We cannot live at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Attention began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is still a century, it was conducting experiments on the plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit is in no way were different varieties of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then it was put into orbit of the insects, small flies breeding flies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo develops in weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One gets a chick perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is then that the problems start.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must be put on its feet and start moving," says the director of the Laboratory of the Institute of the safety problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">By not finding no support, the chicks are waved in a haphazard manner.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 p.m., the babies saw their fully atrophying instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks did not react to the light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, they died just after four days.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We" twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there, "explains Vladimir Sychev in recognizing the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The latest "organic" miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the biosatellite "Bion" ship that the species of the same sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetus in space.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there is nothing natural described.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It was again the biosatellites and then this is the only experience. we must do this kind of research," remarked Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing, the rats have given birth to their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, it still fails to make reproductions directly into space.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is not a trivial matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In losing their normal environment, the animals are no longer able to carry out their instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">Unlike the beasts, the man is capable, in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional substance.</seg>
<seg id="36">This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women are going into space for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the female body is what humanity's most valuable asset.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flew and person on Earth could not say if it held after a flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">If she could give birth to a child after the flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Nobody responded to this issue," says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the area of the rockets and space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father, was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaïev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and has even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk continues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to one offspring in full health after long flights.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">But humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Laboratory Centre for Hydrology Preparationof cosmonauts: mandatory step in preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here, in no buoyancy, the cosmonauts train to the exits extra-véhiculaires.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water mimics weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If for adults, the water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.</seg>
<seg id="54">The small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth comes from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Insofar as the baby grows about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb of her mother, it is easier for him to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is logical in principle, because since its birth in the bath, it happens only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, if for the child just born weightlessness is a more natural state, women need a force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis is size decreases very rapidly, the ability to push the baby is lost.</seg>
<seg id="60">Good agreement, ignore it based on the birthing simulators.</seg>
<seg id="61">Of course you can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will bring it out.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If he did not feel the terrestrial attraction, the agency does not form the skeleton or muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">You can't pay an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experience that we will have to consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté," provides the Director of the committee on bioethics of the Institute of the safety problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The birth of children in the area is still theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, over time it will become a reality, when the Terrans travelling in their commuting to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI public finances) said: "the control of the pseudo self-employment (in Czech" Švarc system ") failed due to the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is what said Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is missing here," said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A control conducted jointly by inspectors Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He cited as an example of abuse the approach of the "system" by Petr Nečas Švarc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls; is permitted or forbidden?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it bans anything, even the head of the government cannot stop the action an investigating authority to inspect demand respect for the law," said Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Committee on Oversight in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which were compared the laws governing public procurement of these two countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was the question?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control that we launched about two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and national laws and an actual practice to follow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "tougher and better quality," however, according to certain parameters, such as the practice is best in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough to continually elaborate rules of increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why is this project can help you and what is the result?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A joint control of this type should contribute to what we stopped trying to clarify the laws, lowering and improve the thresholds, when it was not a really positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude all enrichment and a possible criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For those institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof organized similarly, it also has a board constituted a little differently, but these two institutions are basically the same way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a tinge however compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also has the accounts of this type in the various Länder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The HRB can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, there are controlled at the level of the accounts of the Länder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With regard to national legislation, is simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">No, definitely not, but I repeat, I did not have data for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it must also be said that this country that we see as a model is also facing a series of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are they already feel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">This amendment came into force relatively recently, it does not have any impact on our operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we make up checks, there is a delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Our comments relate only, for the moment, the process of preparing the future control - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public markets - where these changes will come naturally feel, because the thresholds have changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that may arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to meet them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) forces controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it useful to make the law more stringent in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">No, not this way, I think.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So what is the solution to get out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's where we will not.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system is allowed or prohibited Švarc?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it bans anything, even the head of the government cannot stop the action an investigating authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He may declare: "we are going to change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the paperwork and this, precisely in order to protect the tender.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is also tragic that a bidder be removed only for cause of formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is missing here.</seg>

<seg id="10">They will end almost at the time will end the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, on a timezone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who was this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At the outset I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to work together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, shirts, bags, and the original key against the end of the world, they bought online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap with other performers has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled "end of the world (in Czech" Konec světa zrušeno ").</seg>
<seg id="16">It is already very popular on YouTube, will they be heard during these charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world did not take place...</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Joining the anthems at some time in the context of a live show, utterly unique, Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The lyrics of this song was written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you come to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are working with other personalities of the Czech actors, owing to the fact that we organize concerts and charitable events...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to the disabled and we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and it for six years.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers are regularly with students of the institute Jedličkův and propose activities that interest them and enjoy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to go over, we try to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička we will transfer this project in a new independent building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">A number of music groups and performers will end up on stage at each of these concerts?</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria do you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all ages, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, will end up on stage, Support Chinaski Lesbiens Illustratosphere, with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Preparing also to others "mega-events" of this kind in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will play for the first time in the context of the Prague Spring; here, too, we will surely be a quality program with guests interesting.</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">International projects are minimal, up here you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your shot?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so terrible that it looks at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members including the electric wheelchair must travel in bunker gear, of course we trimbalons too much luggage and boxes of instruments....</seg>
<seg id="43">So far everything is always more or less well past, CSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything happened without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ with regard to access facilities for the disabled, the attitude of the public towards persons with disabilities and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="46">What were your experiences until now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow to the east all is still in an initial phase.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only by electric chair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">They are still not as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of the disabled is being created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">How do we still catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things for which we are still behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements are always dependent on efforts by the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">This is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you're, The Tap Tap, rather the contrary to the forefront of progress.</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public and facilities are one thing, but the situation really begins to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="57">For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And as I myself am musician (I play, among others, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.</seg>
<seg id="61">And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The success came in recent years, if I am not mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">This is true, creating links with known singers and work actively to promote the group helped us.</seg>
<seg id="64">We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can we afford quality teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Were you aiming to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.</seg>
<seg id="68">The show business is full of tricks that copy from each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it is logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course.</seg>
<seg id="74">I often say that when people with disabilities to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for all of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Does your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to make the quality work, we must be firm in many areas and require a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think this is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve objectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already there in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">A single, Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are a group open, people come and go, we cannot do anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="84">Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the case on the eve of the day scheduled for the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">This action will take place in Prague in the Arena Incheba, Brno and Ostrava in Fléda to Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">Late in the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio relay when will jointly sang the song of the band The Tap Tap "end of the world cancelled."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to collect funds (25 million CZK) to equip the functional training centre Studeo who is in Prague in the institute Jedlička.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets opened at Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed has participated in a number of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">The road from Poland to space has however started much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they did not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to mention for example the conference of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering book entitled "Introduction to the astronautics."</seg>
<seg id="7">The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski became interested in its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to the astronautics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski relevant (1899-1966), who became a big propagator of astronomy and space travel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics of world renown, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden side of the Moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">As early as 1925 was built in Poland a flanged wheels designed to be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, there is neither the author nor the details of this project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear if the rocket was intended to propel or curb the flanged wheels.</seg>
<seg id="15">The only known about this flanged wheels are those of the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.</seg>
<seg id="18">It emerges from the documents kept that research had reached the stage of testing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research findings are interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the plans of hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">These two projects had to use a military rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the plans to use the technique of the rockets were conducted by the Scientific Advisory Board ("provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The council was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After the war, other work on aeronautique were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time, there is talk of a society in the November issue of the journal 1954, where four more detailed articles devoted to aviation.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the astronautics</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was of the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) showed the efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He retained his position until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket logic RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), who became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">This rocket with a range of 1,800 meters had a length of 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">The result was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-story rocket RM-2 were initiated in the desert of Bledov.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters long and weighed probably 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Following the prototype should be able to perform science - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind aloft.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1963, all development work was stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The rocket Meteor-1 developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first flares of type RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for the scientific tools.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 liter, while Meteor-1B in this volume was 0.34 per litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period 1965-1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later versions were built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland at the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second cosmonaut non-soviétique of this program.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision has raised in the public a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">No doubt it is interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The systems-oriented economic liberalism, both within the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of greater economic competition unregulated.</seg>
<seg id="6">In practical terms, this means that economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free movement (without limits) of private capital ally to a rampant financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The significant differences in the cost of labour (wages) generate a tension on the price.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be put under this term meaning: a producer tries by the importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in "making it more expensive" the price of a competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and increase its own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappear. the result is high unemployment in the country where the price of the work are high compared to other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given that private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment it brings, the social costs of the State may increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">All this situation intensifies the unwillingness of the contractors to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies creates a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is manifested mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to force economically his own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This happens partly by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">It follows a growing poverty and deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there is the public distribution points for food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are already per million people.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes fully aware that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a premium to reach the minimum subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economy measures of almost all the Member States of the south of the EU, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or just stumble along with low wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.</seg>
<seg id="25">We should ask themselves the following question: where will this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from other EU countries, so the poverty will rise from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian African or will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the media, to get bored, that the state cannot make capital investment in its own economy, as the economy headed led to an economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state may not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is then whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the state as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer to this question is certainly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby and present in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">This results in a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of the draft legislation law firms closely tied to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All of the power comes not from the people, as the state constitutions of Western-type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "the rule had long been in full decline and functions were assigned by the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Rockbursts faveurs bribes, illegally obtained, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these positions.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian banking system has collapsed kickbacks and corruption without limits and people went to the election with votes already sold... "..." the honest people did not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State was 8 months without consuls.... "'We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." it is true that Appianos Pompé had in mind, but this is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In conclusion, as in ancient times, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="41">In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to advance the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="42">As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior to the elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state of things, we can see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of the type of liberal democracies as a sort of pause before a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the current elites completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises which we are now witnessing and crimes against humanity as we know them by the recent and ancient history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution, at least in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of economic competition, both international and domestic level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to explore ways to reduce the level of social security for the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is indeed systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution lies in reforms to political goals, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital into the company to the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recurring waves of killings; after all, the current residents of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to offer readers a point of view, located behind the curtain, "on which benefit mainly to long-standing tensions already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of these ideas are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerged from my own understanding of that, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>

<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time when the global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration causing some financial powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare for or carry out wars against the countries in which they have not yet such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of the Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to send money home and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF to have triggered the Great Depression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for power at the global level has resulted in the years 1859 in 1871 in the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war aimed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially in the United Kingdom, and the third is expected to reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire an absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid that are not repeated crises like those that they caused in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">After responding to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand Hapsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">For an outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed in Germany of horrible war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they can then place a strong enough leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she was actually) of fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began.</seg>
<seg id="30">A terrorist acts were committed by all sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The second world war began; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the shackles in which international bankers had held initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps established the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed in Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has ignited a conflagration that could cause a third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or Muslim population generally of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level (just look at how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where there is, at the root of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This should make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers did not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) grow to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which handles 20 percent of all the world's oil (naval corridor has a width of 2 miles) and lead to destruction of the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Under what light now appear to be the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world in which all new born is to implement an electronic chip making him a totally controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"They are forcing all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and bond to cover the hand or forehead a trademark red iron, so that he could neither buy nor sell whoever does not bear the name of this wild beast, or the number of his name.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must understand: anyone who has common sense account numbers of this wild beast.</seg>
<seg id="44">This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators took Islamist students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation was not in the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in effect, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to secure the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, even worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diplomats séquestrés were eventually released 444 days later, after negotiations organized by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory for America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before it is occupied, while six employees of the embassy.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a few detours complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a whirlwind coverage: they left the country with their Canadian passports as members of a team of filming here to do the groundwork for the shooting of a film to show of fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan of the field exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to make the story more credible, specialized magazines did state of this film project, press conferences were organized and a shadow production company had real offices.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were long secret, the film is based on the recollections of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film, Affleck is a combination of several kinds.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Musiciennes move: sequences of Tehran of documentary style (in the captioned sequences are presented to the iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),</seg>
<seg id="21">Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor ridiculed, he became a director and respected his game of actor has ceased to generate ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature dark after the police "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is also the first movie Affleck who is not taking place in his home town of Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The meaning of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck is also showing that sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "shall" by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes from the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, is writing a page of history.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the wrong team of filming in the Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many shares at too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to settle for a subject is in fact that few thrilling scenes, the film sense of the term.</seg>
<seg id="33">He is doing very well, he adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is sidelined by a phone call in America and the prosecution on the runway are pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are utterly charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters have deserved a larger place and it is far from being the only in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film of Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, it leaves a moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">It takes the viewer, but with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of history, yet somehow incomplete to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he made the case.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry on bank charges the most absurd, has decided to launch the competition of the regulation or the ideas from the workshop "EU" the most absurd.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies was at the origin of our decision," said to the newspaper Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the absurdities noted, there have already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, however, the women were an advantage for the rates of life insurance because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">People can report until the end of the year all other idea as incredible "the workshop of the EU."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components, bio-fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Critics have also been established in the past against the ban on the use of the term "spreadable butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The quality of bananas must have a size 14 centimeters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be of a size 14 cm or present a "normal."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission has defined by arguing that she only harmonise national standards not homogeneous seeking trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the regulation of the EU last year that must appear on the inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU has referred to a U.S. investigation that the balls are among the toys, the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 years for trumpets blowing in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here, too, it was strange ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In collaboration with the association "Keep Doing" liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the regulation of the Union regarding the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic reached then, for example, the volume set for the canned mushrooms risqua and a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of this investigation have found interesting the idea of paying sums of money in some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of a grant to apply for the grants.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas are not from Brussels but of Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The fact of having no sea we handicap.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are going to ask the European Union a refund. "this is expressed in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following the purchases said "interventionist", the state was found with inventory full that he had then export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from the country without maritime access.</seg>
<seg id="30">The subsidies for grants have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development headed by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write applications for grants from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU said: "the bizarre regulations are rare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fight that she no longer) raises strong emotions among Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs successfully defended the title "Olomoucké tvarůžky," for which the name "Tuzemský rum" dating back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."</seg>
<seg id="36">Only alcohol-based products, sugar cane, and not out of sugar beet, may bear the name of rum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products from the EU, we are now in the company of world-renowned cheeses like feta cheese or continue to Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits, Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp and Pohořelice Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and hops in Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").</seg>
<seg id="38">The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets Otava of" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. Senator, how do we have the idea to stand in the presidential elections?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is not to be a senator or president who account for me.</seg>
<seg id="4">If all was without problems in our country, I wouldn candidate nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can no longer bear to see as the country was looted since last 20 years that the thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the retirement age increase.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't have the ambition of a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that doesn't please me, then I try to provide a solution for that change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any political party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You entered the Senate but you put quickly en route to the Château (Alexey Petrov: seat of the presidency).</seg>
<seg id="10">Is it that you don't turn our backs on those who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have always said that I will launch in the battle for the Château depending on the results of the senatorial elections</seg>
<seg id="12">Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would come to the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a function, it is merely an instrument enabling me to realize my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is why I need the influence the largest and broadest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television sets, but also that we are marking time everybody who try to make the change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of persons and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, for example, said in my statement that I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Venons-en your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You began the fight for the Château with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns active beyond 20 million [of CZK].</seg>
<seg id="20">You have to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won my case.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As independent, a member of any political party, I have much more likely to get the support of all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and partisan dogma, take every party that is best for our country and implementing it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider as a man of left or right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me rather left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, that this is a little to the left or right, it is not really important.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, what's important is that we move forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">What counts for me, it is not that people are on the left or the right but to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always support any solution that contribute to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="35">When you build a business plan in a company, you also have a certain goal and vision.</seg>

<seg id="37">Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke were applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament, you still have slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">You don't survivrez long in politics with this.</seg>
<seg id="40">Do you think that if you're going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my side to impose it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">They would then possibly explain why they do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">When there is a strong personality that identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I confess, bluntly, be an amateur, and not a genius, or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">I just throw me in politics and I try to get the support of the majority in my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I am trying, alone, to make things, and if it doesn't, I stop in six years and I will return in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="54">I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I introduced myself because people are really angry, but now I hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people have not voted and what did have, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have written a Senate that will be hard to impose changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite everything, I will pour my vision, for example the election by direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Envisagez-vous to base your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I do not have the financial means.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk of tax returns, what's yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I think about 60 million worth of my personal property.</seg>
<seg id="67">I in Prague a value of 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork with a value of about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, I have one Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always loved James Bond, while driving his car, was with the women and fought against evil and abuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You want to change the Republic but don't want to invest your own money?</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million for this campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I should debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I could not live, for example, pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If my only goal was to earn money, I am not present in any elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You will therefore continue your commercial activities in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did you said that you provide your activities to mute?</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only the subject of imagination. for contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think this is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company neighbour, we said: "yes, it is actually nice, this building."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we still need today of a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries ringardes, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a bedroom community which has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record.</seg>
<seg id="8">The town of 80,000 souls displays the lowest rates of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city decided several years ago, contribute to the general culture and reproduce the shadow seven bridges on the euro notes in the form of miniature pretty painted concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, the authorities of the city realized that there was only one way to retake control the statistics: the construction of a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the architects MVRDV Rotterdam, master of the charts bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual composure and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the members of the jury still stood, bewildered and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice by order of size into a pyramid, and he finished his speech buttressed arguments activists by a common: "Dear!"</seg>
<seg id="14">In this, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up.</seg>
<seg id="16">The building is part of a revitalization project also includes an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books received the second "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This small town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a modern pedestrian zone and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades to think that they contain a dairy, a contemporary architectural work.</seg>
<seg id="20">The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to reading</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Eldorado of the book under glass.</seg>
<seg id="23">Admittedly, a lift takes you through the heart of the massive, but the true joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you disregard the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor lamps and elegant unequivocally speak the language of the municipal public spaces.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is already looking for the eyes of the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play ball.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books and more books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally, the library shelves along the facade and in the middle is a room big and dark, which is often uncomfortable and personnel," Willy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and open spaces for reading from the interior to the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inside the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet Chess Club, the Centre for the environment and the technical control of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes sheathing, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.</seg>
<seg id="32">A new experience for sight, touch and smell.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened do not want unknown materials.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the town of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a day we found in a farm business Frisian ad hoc waste from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the Netherlands, it uses for years of synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and it saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The end membrane is used for a season or two, then we can throw it out.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, slabs of a thickness of four centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the effect of heat and pressure, "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose smell evokes both a new car and sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">After nearly 500 meters, the literary cafe offers stunning views of the city, but also of the Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.</seg>
<seg id="43">They create an atmosphere, but they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">A new donations for the soul.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"This is unbelievable, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The temperature of the building is resolved by geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun shines as little time inside, even on a sunny day.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thick wooden beams mounted through the use of glass facade of Sunvisors, intercepting a large part of the rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The atmosphere is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The fully automated blinds can do the rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette Verhaig also was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, describes itself as "the Boekenberg vô finally found" of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a few weeks during the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from its library staff.</seg>
<seg id="55">This has helped to bridge the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 pounds).</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is a success.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are overflowing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">For the architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a library half empty."</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think our invitation has created some relationship between Anthroposophy and this new building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only for decoration. "</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Although it may seem younger and less educated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "the Germans must play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But she then chose to abstain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Berlin must be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But I also believe that it does not support either the US position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, NATO imposed this measure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany finds difficulties to adopt a clear position on the major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually destroyed by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the lack of a common and coherent policy within the Union complicates the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are clashing on several fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expecting them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think they tâtonnent yet to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal."</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as in France or Britain</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">That means when the term of foreign policy "normal" for the Germans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and its European partners, including as regards the national issues.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and to abstain from the vote on the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany had first important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is undoubtedly a decisive point.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, I would award is not too much importance, because it is not purely unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this is a decisive element in the strategic thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany present its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from voting on important issues, as in the case of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that the Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">This is why I think the gap is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps that Germany will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="35">Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="37">By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.</seg>
<seg id="38">Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There have always been differences due to the US domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration secretly made a great understanding toward the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But given the political configuration of the country, the Government of course cannot defend its position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm towards the policy of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany finds the difficulties in reconciling its close relationship with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think it does not make things any easier for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They therefore cannot be within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.</seg>
<seg id="48">This is what they do in the current issue of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">In my opinion, Germany will be in the future a vanguard role and will push Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This issue has always been sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role which marks more independence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany is sent to play the role of a player on the international stage, Germany want only assume a key role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or difficulties still to play leading roles?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not yet accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many German sentiments are heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not make things any easier for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, it is always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From that point view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must contend with neighbours and opinions varied, and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Today, the influence of the United States on European policy continues to diminish, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, so who is left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="63">And even if they do not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, such is life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together the challenges of the transatlantic community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly became Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are trademarks known throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Armani Polo... what is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mark enjoys protection as well as the company that bears the name cannot complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even if it could, he is not sure that it would win the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, a new folder arrived on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">A German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the sports goods manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where the registrations with the trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company has artificially created by claiming a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities, shopping centres on several floors that are almost as counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="16">The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents the load to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese talk of "Bang Mingpai," parent brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">It is with this term that are designated women who marry rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is bad for business, we must fight against this trend," requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The mark is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and costs of running into millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the flagship products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and one that is growing as quickly.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, it is not easy to expunge the dubious records of the Trademark Register and these procedures are expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch referred to the trial in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle prevails.</seg>
<seg id="30">A famous case also concern graphics.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery maker Sany, the same company that came to Putzmeister concrete pumps.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely, logger of Volvo, before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW. the conflict was resolved and Geely had the change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarism of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admitted, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the Office would be spent last year of an "emergency situation in the conduct of the work at a restored normalcy."</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the number of opposition procedures untreated dropped by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Expensive act</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to the Office, it is a record and it means that China is for the 10th consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This would also occur for the total number of illegal marks of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of law.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, each recording reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">A legal battle would cost much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of components for vehicles to be suspended.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the imitator was able to maintain its rights on the Chinese TOFD Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"This is our fault, because the names of family cannot be protected in Germany," said Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Trademark Office had dismissed the objection of Munichites.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freudenberg has prevailed with two following bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Vigilance is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, he added: "the process is long, stressful and cost us a lot of time and money."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. the archives service even had to review the actions of the last 100 years to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This is what you see what this means for us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East threatening to spill into Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">This would be the case if copycats of this region ensured the exploitation of non-protected.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, a Chinese producer wants to table in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for the production company of footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">The company had long since abandoned this sector, but she could still prevent the deposit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Wentzler added: "it is important to be vigilant."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pattloch and advise him to the German companies a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should instead "Save also in China can be protected," said Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay a license fee to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will lose our place on the segment of the market in question.</seg>

<seg id="27">At Esitjeni, one can see smaller scale what ails Swaziland: HIV infection rates and the highest life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population is almost never accept male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven to reduce the risk of infection by half.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40% of the population of the Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a trip to group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. the Imbongis have seen many children in the street that was missing not only the parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In a poor country without school diploma, there was simply no prospect.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the beginning, there were just a few people who are personally committed to shed a few euros each year to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But barely a year later, the choir based "Voices for Africa," an association that has been an almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.</seg>

<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What is the most common sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Among the bacterial STIs, syphilis, and gonorrhea chlamydiées gonorrhea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Common STIs are HIV, the human papilloma virus, the herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups concerned?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear among men who have sex with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sex between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five said in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">Among adults, the heterosexual infections linked to the chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The rate of HIV infection among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. however, some 20% of new HIV infections are occurring within the group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the young, there is a rate of infections linked to the chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What is the change in the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">It is not mandatory for all sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms of a disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of the genitalia, pain, urinary losses white, pain in the lower abdomen and the emergence of pimples and warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain hidden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How to protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100%.</seg>
<seg id="58">The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating Mediastinitis or narrow body contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing sexual partners to regularly review.</seg>
<seg id="60">Most STIs quickly screened can be cured and the late effects can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to sponsorship, donations, but especially to the funds that are reaping the choristers thanks to their voices in Germany, the means to accumulate.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In all, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of themselves and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, one of their grandmothers for example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The victims, so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them receive until 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that they go every day at the school in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">The orphan who has no person is allowed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare the meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a school of couture and allowed the construction of two barns. with the support of the American organization for health PSI, the association hosted a screening test for HIV for many people.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not automatic, because even if the disease is visible in all countries, it remains a taboo subject.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king and his 13 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is an issue which affects sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">This is rather odd, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">These morals sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is however condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different, flesh against flesh. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to foster some cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi leave together traveling every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the black continent still face the time of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus filled with whites who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also snatched a tear to some formidable guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light," say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after a trip to 8,733 miles as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, before these choristers who get the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Str., there is also the light.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="3">The layer of ice could reach 20 metres thick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains of frozen water, as explained three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science."</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shade.</seg>
<seg id="7">This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water is probably derived from comets or asteroids that may have struck Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, no one makes the connection between the discovery of water and the presence of life on the planet, "said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">The discovery could help understand how water and other essentials to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Inaperçus of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">From time to time, they send images to the earth, such small cracks through which we see infinity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The image comes from a camera developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Pluto, which orbit around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "babies" in the delivery room of the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars, called "W5," a romantic little, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a star dying.</seg>
<seg id="20">The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she died.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In the vast nebula Trifide, 5,400 light years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Pleiades star cluster also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye during the night.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the telescope puts more colors in value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In this photo, the Helix nebula of infrared, as a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is located 700 years away in the constellation of Aquarius.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Its similarities with a terrestrial continent have earned him the title of North America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo reveals a spectacular tinge.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="29">Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have managed to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy focuses on the creation of the rings of Saturn.</seg>
<seg id="31">One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace.</seg>

<seg id="32">One of the photographs the largest and most net that has taken the Hubble telescope is that of the galaxy of Twister.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to the hue, photographs of the galaxies can become real works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the amorphous Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light years.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the heart shining in the birthplace of stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic demolition derby in the constellation Ophiuchus: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush toward one another, the collision is inevitable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Hubble has observed the birth of stars in a spiral galaxy M83.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname of "wheel of Southern fire."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula of Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.</seg>
<seg id="40">The nebula is located 1,400 years away and is composed of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This photo was developed pictures taken by various optical and X-ray telescopes.</seg>
<seg id="42">You can see the circle of black holes at 430 million light years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.</seg>
<seg id="44">Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy "GC 1810."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this cloud is the group of young stars in our Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">These clouds of stars, which are linked to the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there was that of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our eyes on the world's major telescopes:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, Galileo before it screens a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see further into the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror image on this had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the United States, are using the Large Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The Gran Telescopio Canarias belly at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached 10.4 meters in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.</seg>
<seg id="59">The diameter, reaches about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which restricts mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its uniqueness lies in its ability to collect light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in mirrors of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The scientists listen to the universe in the search for alien signals from the radio telescope of (Puerto Rico).</seg>
<seg id="65">This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI," or "search for alien intelligence"), using the power of his machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here lies the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thanks to a total of four mirrors the telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. it will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the telescope will not take the shots before 2018 at the earliest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.</seg>
<seg id="75">The telescopes are part of the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea who observed the sky with the Subaru Telescope and were.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">This figure can be admired.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the images of the area's most important we come from the Hubble Space Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990, we book of images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.</seg>
<seg id="82">This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5.</seg>
<seg id="84">The first of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">The telescope will notably task to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after bigbang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists believe the south pole of Mercury harbors ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, no reliable data on this theory does not exist, because Messenger orbit far closer to the North Pole of Mercury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar data indicated for decades the presence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to Reconnaissance Orbiter around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.</seg>

<seg id="6">There's even a museum of longevity.</seg>
<seg id="7">An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The trip to the mountains Talysh is an unbridled romanticism.</seg>
<seg id="9">The many turns of the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers torrentiels and small farms.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here we are in the deep south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which little is known, if only they are fluent in Farsi and Azeri and they have a very long life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminus: Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small town plastronne too aggressive with its architecture of the Soviet era, which is not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.</seg>
<seg id="16">It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.</seg>
<seg id="17">The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May thanks in the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest in the world," says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">One can discover the lives of approximately eight dozens of Talysh region will have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Here's my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Having a child to 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is, however, no birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when you think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than questionable.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times and it would have been 23 children. at the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Şirali Müslümov would wrong a few decades in calculating his age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A surprisingly older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence due to the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Each day, a glass of melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless, it is the fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explained that the Talysh have special genes.</seg>
<seg id="38">By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, think it is a question of food.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and milk products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of the people? to Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">She is sitting on the ground next to a churner, it beats the content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.</seg>
<seg id="45">Two small children enjoy also in the house.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen making tea for the guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of belly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that his son tells us with pride.</seg>
<seg id="48">I've always washed my hair with milk, and thus I have never lost and they have kept their color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The monthly pension is enough to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She still ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then, she spoke of her husband who was in the military.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst moments have been after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">But all has improved when the "Dear father Heydar Aliyev took the helm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has ruled his country as a dictator, does almost no limits in Azerbaijan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good living in the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe the son of long greying Mirzayeva is right: "the seniors have great respect in our culture."</seg>
<seg id="62">They are the centre of the big family, they are loved, and happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is a good reason to live as long as possible.</seg>

<seg id="12">However, the Egyptians and the world didn't really know what wants to save this engineer of 61 years, holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The judiciary be reversed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly Islamic majority of 100 people during a tour de force of 15 hours are indeed disturbing to some extent.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the law is based on "the principles of Islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But that really means the word "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the margin for maneuver legal to implement a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In any case it is that suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters pertaining to the Sharia, Azhar University must be consulted. the establishment of Islamic institution is the largest in the country and his brilliance shines on all the Sunni Islamic world.</seg>
<seg id="19">This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the military court.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the reign of Hosni Mubarak, gives these courts to repress opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.</seg>
<seg id="24">The state must also, "reads the draft, protect" the true nature of the Egyptian family "and" promote their morals and values. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of the art cinema and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Clearly, it would be a simple matter of censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In addition, there are no articles explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead, another article prohibits offend or denigrating the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the rule does not define what is an offense or how it should be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Suffit-il to draw a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?</seg>
<seg id="32">Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi put to vote and who, in his own words, "very soon" will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution" manipulates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Cairo's Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution is reborn and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi launches, came third in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history."</seg>
<seg id="38">On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi of trying to foment a "coup against democracy."</seg>
<seg id="39">"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and reversed," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, several judges have pledged not to monitor the referendum that involve its invalidity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">The veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people are asking for the implementation of the law of God."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Our country!" shampoo, demandaient-ils to Morsi, saying that "the Koran [their] Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim Brotherhood has said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, spoke loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box of the direction the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">The project of the Islamists will win the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Human rights are not mentioned once."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which should extend until February and encompass all social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This human rights advocate of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had discovered the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in courts under Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">He did not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">That is why he has been beaten, tried and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now, the term is not even uttered once in the new Constitution," therefore regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.</seg>
<seg id="57">The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are blatant violations to the rules of democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president takes off all its powers," deplores Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">But a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could afford.</seg>
<seg id="63">A protester Tharir Square warns: "you accouchez of a monster that there will no longer be possible to control."</seg>

<seg id="1">The rakfisk of Norway: if the fish is the most fragrant world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the space for an extremely fragrant fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take advanced cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Placez-les in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty football.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wait a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you get the smell of disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It snows, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, permeates the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - according to the smell that you want it exhales - up to a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When darkness settles and it's cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen full-time local fireman, also known as "rakfisk General," responsible for the management of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and seem to be a large quantity of drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people prefer the aquavit the rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink kills the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid getting under your nose, this is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi chefs who have spent long hours in a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water in the air, then salted in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, during the winter, once he is released, the fermented fish and - no doubt with the sense of diminished by alcohol - eaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In previous generations, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">At present, the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, higher wages and a comprehensive health system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, though, of the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is one of the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="25">But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to annoy him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of 22 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such an act of barbarism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes transperçant, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a tray of rakfisk by hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are - how do you say - people cautious.</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are discrete, we do not like us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, has invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When other countries laid money down the drain, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she says in a carefree laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm standing under the snow and I am the queue to buy food - I had my share of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a true discovery, it was excellent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel in which I spent is one of the many places where it serves the rakfisk for dinner and where they can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the strongest scent of them.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a TV show where the presenter wearing his trademark bowties, surrounded by rakfisk plates.</seg>
<seg id="44">One would believe oneself in the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What have you given to score the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"This is our points, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We hear laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, looks at the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, of which there are many.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city where traffic jams are rife in normal times, a dam security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access into the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from reaching their workplaces, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the House.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A complicated task ahead of him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico's economy is doing well, results that outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a war on drugs that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">A sprawling densely populated state and gripping the capital. on its stamping ground, opinions are divided on this new leader.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is etched in the memory of all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The office attributed the development of tourism and infrastructure in the county.</seg>
<seg id="16">To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, formerly bosselées and full of cracks.</seg>
<seg id="17">A plaque bearing his name is attached to the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive museum dedicated to climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We are counting on him to put in place lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the Party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">He rejected criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This is a complete man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under the autoponts highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a disaster zone, were found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the most violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.</seg>
<seg id="33">At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face this reality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fight to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">The official version reported suicides by Mariana in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, his family believe that she was killed by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I got home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed," tells the Lady Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">A signs indicated that she had been beaten, and this was already underway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall, next to a cross which uses the word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a birthday, a disorder pleurnicheuse.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you accept what they say and we remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico during the past six years and the new president has promised that he would make it his priority during his tenure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope it will be as good as president when he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, Member of Congress.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bradley Manning had not complained of ill-treatment, state prosecutors.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse including Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during the detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The trial focuses on Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Prosecutors have sought to demonstrate on Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about ill treatment that he allegedly suffered during his military detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. improved Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaint about his treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the case be classified Manning on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and was a severe enough punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This military intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">During the hearing Friday, Fein has discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officers posed questions to Manning and recorded her answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Fein raised the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that has reserved his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had within the prison was generally "very professional."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms do any complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly when asked about his treatment in prison, "said Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded the issues raised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They have established" no problem "(after addressing the concerns), however, this does not mean that I had not caused any problems," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury."</seg>
<seg id="20">The military reported that they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level below the closer surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to cut this status... to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and will be issued once because of the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He added that the fact of not having been informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very stressful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage," said Manning, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought I was going to die in that cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent much of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning also said that he had only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He has tried to remain in motion, because sleep or reclining position during the day was against the rules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woken up to see his face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The lawyer of Manning filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning has been placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and others described a morning, during the appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover it with a blanket during the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="36">For questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said he had discussed the agenda of his warnings that it was dropping its coverage that could hide their nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered him to drop.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he allegedly tried to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning reportedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his or her flip-flops to harm themselves, but that he had not done so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That night, Manning testified that her underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences that he lived during his detention and that it would substantially reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense has said that Manning intends to plead guilty to the less serious offences and fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules governing the detention of all prisoners at Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If all the charges are accepted, he could face life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="6">Signs indicated two tracks: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing where to turn leader.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in the central California, where I was called the "Mexican all my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">It is an ethnic qualifier, in the same way that my friends in Boston use when they say 'Irish', or my friends in New York when they say 'Italian. "</seg>
<seg id="10">Secondly, I became "Mexico-Américain."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here, it was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, on the ground that has seen my grandfather, no need for special qualifier or hyphens.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and I headed toward the file "foreigners."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender in writing half of their territory at the barrel of a gun.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a U.S. official formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico, the relationship the most difficult is that the country has with more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want it addresses the issue of bitterness?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and other for which the country cannot offer.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at the moment, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity to Mexico and had to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than not, this person was a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even if we are living the American dream, we went in good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="37">We attach to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We remind them a humiliating defeat and they alike, as if we were individuals from lower strain and not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be party.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we do not end up stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States but lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, I remember that there was friction between the Mexicans and Mexico-Américains, because the Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and Mexico-Américains are upset.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although U.S. citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Moreover, many Mexico-Américains I know do not have the impression of being part of a country or the other.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we see as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we regard as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And now, complicating the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a country that must absolutely superb visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, if we consider the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are present, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is normal.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members were treated not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps more "Mexicans" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old quarrels, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Nor will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">A further bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">While remain the same arguments useful to know which began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has all shatters, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in the regional upheaval.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps their fight will increase even more.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them to get out of this impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that is no loser or winner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems difficult for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of the strength of the two sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.</seg>
<seg id="14">Having killed some of its leaders and deported the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded planet, Israel has not responded to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.</seg>
<seg id="17">The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regional power booming, once its closest Muslim ally of Israel, has made a strong case for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Golf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The members of Hamas are growing and saying that the Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most of the Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diplomacy in the future, Hamas may emerge as an important player who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, hardliners of Israel draw opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will be able to sleep at night - for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the recent wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">But above all, Israel has thrived, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime ministry, which has totally ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in terms of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud Party merged with a party even more hawkish leader, Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election on 22 January, a beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why treat these doomed by giving them a Palestinian state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they ran the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind this wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should also think about the future.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is designed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer remains as advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">A small hope, and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to outsiders to champion the cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, who must now tackle to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to be united.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next a pseudo-state at the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is a very narrow vision.</seg>
<seg id="54">The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.</seg>
<seg id="55">This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The laws for packages of cigarettes neutral came into force in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the brand</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and performances of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Besides the different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small type on all packages.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most stringent in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian government has said that the aim was to deter youth smoking by removing any representation glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance they begin ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children associated the crown logo to a princess. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Even if Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco manufacturers have said that it would reopen the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"A negative consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others said that the law had boosted their activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the cigarette cases, in particular, to mask the horrific Uncollapsed packaging, has strongly increased two months since that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost before the High Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, business is good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to hide the cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned advertisements on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you are no more than a small storefront to promote your products, the Internet is par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman has noticed an increase in the contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of the brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">We must ask ourselves if there is a simple citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and who took the trouble to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have reported to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos of warning in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">A tougher laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.</seg>
<seg id="32">The photos do not bother me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I ignores them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"You take a cigarette machines and the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package featuring a photo of cancer of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, this is my little girl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the heart of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to storage of packages on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Before, I needed an hour to unload packages, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government only had to ban them once and for all, and we said OK, this is good, it stops and you put the key in the door," he added, lifting the arms to the sky.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I spent five hours in an airport during the period from Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Therefore, I had plenty of time to reflect on the theme of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am not going to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - bored from time to time, they said.</seg>
<seg id="8">This forces the brain to take interesting, even to nurture creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types of screens, we are not aware of the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Then we should welcome the boredom with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the case, "said Peter Toohey Greco, a professor of history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of" Boredom: a Lively History "(Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The trouble goes back very far," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they go back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Then there is the definition that we give the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been found and destroyed, in different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After numerous publications and submitted the idea in a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have described the boredom as an experience that is "trying to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What makes the boredom of apathy, "he says," is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like.</seg>
<seg id="22">With apathy, "he says, it is not the desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, it is "the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a sullen mood and feel that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can strongly resemble a depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem is with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think we're bored when in fact it is a problem of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV show that had no report, others have just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group has not all heard the soundtrack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more worried than the other two groups - they have struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you try to focus on a difficult task, or taking a break from the attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, when you make a tedious task, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you do not get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that when it wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn more and waving retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We're bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight of aircraft, a speaker with a voice lacking in sparkle, a film particularly annoying.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more likely to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure this, researchers have developed a scale "predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes statements such as, "among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have the time to do it all."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, including need many and varied stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper.</seg>
<seg id="41">He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored in school and for homework at home, while 23 percent said they get bored when they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In contrast, 3 percent of the parents reported getting bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he added that he knew "adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level," particularly because the children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If I based my question: boredom is good for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, placing bets or abusing substances to pass the time, as studies show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">By contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"The trouble is the way that the brain was found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">If your child is bored and give him an iPad, it will miss most, but he will not have learned to handle alone nor autorégler, said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we should glorify the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Just as I do not think we should criticise.</seg>
<seg id="57">Feel at ease outside the constant ferment that generate the activities and technology is the goal toward which we should strive for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, was indicted for something that will soon become legal in his state: the meatballs possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4">After that the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for drug possession and material that could be used to its consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a court appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But is it a?</seg>
<seg id="7">During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote from Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving drug use a low depends more on the place of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were shelved.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police force has ceased to indict adults over the age of 21 for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the prosecutors who are in the most conservative of the Colorado have called to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to charge the persons who possess them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of western vote now to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Things are moving so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Regulators from the state of Washington will also pose a few questions.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulation on marijuana, firstly regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.</seg>
<seg id="17">But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent on which we could build on," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a gap of a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees adequate access to marijuana approved and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis within a radius of 30 kilometers around a school, a park, a playground or a kindergarten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will be no more difficult than urban areas to install a registered trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (the public prosecutor) would do more people aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charge people for this type of offence "with immediate effect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">To Weld County in northern Colorado, "district attorney" (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users to detoxify.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those who have committed a crime which, at the time, was an offence recognized," said Mr. Buck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions have been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favour of the limited consumption of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest town in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, argued that decision, but decided not to drop all cases of possession of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework appropriate government and personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials as regards the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"It is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws "(National Organization for the Reform of the laws on marijuana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute those who smoked marijuana, therefore, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While advocates and representatives of the state provide a new frontier of legalized sales, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which designs always sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will break.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite some high-profile arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If it is true that the police is not likely to depress the doors to pick up small packets of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes the shops licensed to sell marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy advisor to the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Many Colorado cities were not waiting for the federal authorities act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the vote, some local governments have adopted moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a year's delay.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the town of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should enforce the ban next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we faced a federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community has voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions arise.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).</seg>
<seg id="2">It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of joining the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and my elder brother have studied in what seemed to me a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Yet, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that students from the first round had sexual relations in the room next to mine.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink cups chipped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I fled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I fled, because I had been intimidated and the subject of constant bullying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I had a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have been persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly influential advised Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why mention it today, maybe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-students of the same type of persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, in the same way as those gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the student lounge (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College reported that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and undesirable SENTÍAN" because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to have a representative in the Committee of the university for equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("wonderland: young, intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the policy among students, and which dépeignait "Tories" as the eccentric and the Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was mentioned specifically the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), "which moves in a silver Rolls-Royce, complete and moves with a cane to shiny head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, the conservative students said they would be treated as scapegoats for the implementation of rising tuition fees. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years, Vice President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a newspaper Sunday that" there is a growing left in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR towards those who are centre.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is an obstacle to the freedom of the intellectual debates, as well as to the welfare of the members," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I was the only one to think this way during my first weeks in Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came in September 1986, when I was 18 years of age and a crippling shyness.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party was very slow.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">From the first days of the week, when the new students have knowledge with other teachers, and I had a foretaste of what was going to happen next.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm toward students Tory, but that they were taking pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It was as if the policy regarding the striking miners, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved in wood from classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first sarcasm that I was the victim was a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"</seg>
<seg id="37">I lost his footing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a small man in the face, easily outstrips pustular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Does the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students have laughed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The tears I burned the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched a truculent tone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room, inconsolably.</seg>
<seg id="44">During the dinner tonight, I am sitting alone and then I felt a tap on my shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">This was a student in his second year of studies of English, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said, politely.</seg>
<seg id="47">I am afraid that it does.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the young Tory purport to be Labour (Labour).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, at the local pub, I carelessly tried to hide.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I did not agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">This scheme has failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students echoed the refrain.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverted, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How the Tories do they love?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59">They hit each other, isn't it? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">Do you only able to lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Do you were forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">Do you had become Labour and disown my opinions?</seg>
<seg id="64">The next three years would resemble a purgatoire ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speech.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was almost never there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view of the marxiste-déterministe history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Thou shalt not be happy here," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends dwellers more open-minded.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.</seg>
<seg id="73">It was disbelief.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.</seg>
<seg id="76">They do not do that, not in the city to the ladies dreamers.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends had impeccable communist ways.</seg>
<seg id="78">He had tears in her eyes.</seg>
<seg id="79">Laisse-leur a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure this is for teasing.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you left Oxford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a meeting of work led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the utmost seriousness, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Rougissant internally of shame, I accepted to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and traitai them "old crazy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">This is my father who has pressed the last nail in my coffin oxfordien.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I stayed back and forth in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I am never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can also treat me of chicken.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no child of 18 years should not be a victim of such bullying in school.</seg>
<seg id="95">The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also benefits from an unshakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Valentino prefers the elegance to notoriety."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As part of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona and other celebrity clients of the Italian fashion designer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The couturier acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture," a retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house during the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I love it," he said, with its inimitable Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This exhibition is the culmination of a story, "he is the only player signore" Garavani, but that could not be established without its famous clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Marie-Chantal of Greece and Princess Margaret of England.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino exposes his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: the fashion designer of the small town of Voghera, northern Italy, the idol of the international jet set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">There's nothing wrong to love the royalty.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least, they do not their cigarette butts on your splendid carpet like pop stars," said Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza Fiona.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We erect all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad," says the former wife of "Heini Thyssen," close friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino has always preferred the elegance.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even so, he is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Argentine supermodel Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several years ago, after a parade on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.</seg>
<seg id="21">We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decor, the food, the music.</seg>
<seg id="22">"With him, each guest was important and appreciated," recalls the "Top Model," which began to work with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It never ends, because his creations are works of art," termine-t-elle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Parade of noble lineage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but loves shared.</seg>
<seg id="26">He likes the people very high and with the greatest titles and they love him, too.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour of sixty meters wide which proposes exchanging roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must scroll on the podium to admire a "public" dream of bearing the main creations of Valentino, as the suit that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">Among the public of mannequins, Organoarsenicals names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.</seg>

<seg id="29">Abascal Naty and designer in 2006</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Many of his clients say the first Valentino clothing are like first love, "impossible to forget."</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember well.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was a pair of pants, shirts, jackets "gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection of 1971 / 72.</seg>
<seg id="33">"This is a gift that I had done," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the couturier.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I prefer to all others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty," adds the ex-duchesse.</seg>
<seg id="35">I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The princess and Patricia Della Giovampaola modeuse d'Arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time that she wore a Valentino model.</seg>
<seg id="38">When she was a teenager and was living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his gowns for evening...</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red evening gown with a flowing skirt, a bustier draped neckline and a fall.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," says the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Princess of Arenberg retains the evening dresses of the couturier with "the utmost care, because an evening gown is not only a dress, she is also all the memories that she vehicle."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" of fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress worn Marie-Chantal Miller married Paul of Greece in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="47">It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the designer called his seamstresses) to achieve this silk dress with inlays of ivory beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half metres behind.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of haute couture to the end of the 20th century, "the return of the high-society."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Obnubilé for years by the "skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani became more honoured than any of her husband.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Its refinement, its calm, well-perfect and I have always been clear to me," acknowledges d'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.</seg>
<seg id="53">He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friend.</seg>
<seg id="54">"It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."</seg>

<seg id="4">This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living by wearing the sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Having reaped big rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilograms, it installs them in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through the steep trails.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude porters exhausted, but more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss.</seg>

<seg id="16">"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the holder who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto income is close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java to convert to Islam."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 porters load of sulphur baskets on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanised extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to holders who work on their own and are paid to the weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, they are not under the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park billed the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is done for the animals, not humans," protests Madrusin corpulent porter, a 42-year-old who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left for college.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">I am a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, fulfil our civic duty and give life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint tablets, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lyrics from a rap group that uses local references as "will put a referendum in the drawer" to mock the birth rate of Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hope to draw attention to the problem of fun with this advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to the people "their national duty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is intended solely for the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the main problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that this was an issue that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to pheromones or organize speed-dating evenings.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were creative, but they may not have worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">We therefore said the following: what could be more creative in solving this problem as a rap song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Government of Singapore did not take more seriously.</seg>
<seg id="17">He spends 1,300 dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers pays up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city rich and high technology from southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was above 2, considered the replacement rate, it was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why the Singaporeans not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says that this is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the establishment of a family," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and to delay marriage and the births, which has resulted in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at sharply increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are Web sites that moves a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore enjoyed last year its worst election results since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also unintended consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can be built in specific areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments are 46 square meters and their sale won much success.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a lifestyle of Célibataires and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than the larger housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">For this reason, it is much more profitable for cash.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines to proponents, who previously put a spanner in the works if they wished to propose too small in a housing project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If these new regulations could be a step toward increasing the national birth rate in discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people might start later," said a young framework.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people may have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young twenty years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, it is the women themselves who have the last word.</seg>

<seg id="7">The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four of the cases, they have linked the term "something very personal" and "the password and user name" when they have applied to social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"I do not without giving away my personal secrecy in a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the Private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They are very secretive secret, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I post on FB, images of the fun and games.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also discussed with my friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I will not share one of my photos or someone who could make a fool," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The boy recognizes that it was wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on Facebook and its nine subscribers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority are from the family.</seg>
<seg id="17">His mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I don't know if I was them, I just position," he said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">He says that he would never accept the application of an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">It will not do not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of Jose, 14 years, is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on this last, he admitted that he did not know 20 of the people included on its list of friends.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I don't worry because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, nobody has made advances nor requested her address or phone number.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="29">The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the boy.</seg>
<seg id="30">A relative of one of my friend was bullied on a social network.</seg>
<seg id="31">They threatened him and demanded money.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, a professor of English and Bachelor of Education and Learning, considers that to steer children and adolescents, we must understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed," she says. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras said that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and digital immigrants," uses these words to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with the technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We, the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are in the process of learning," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He adds that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite attitude on what he needed or not disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity."</seg>
<seg id="46">"We also call on them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the privacy of children and adolescents is to use issues that they are sobering.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them not to do nothing," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Secondly, Porras lists some examples: there are things that you would not be telling a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you see that they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published?</seg>
<seg id="51">Sais-tu what others publish on you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you identifies photos of festivities, about the other people permission to identify them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And also, everyone needs to know what you're doing at every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Monitoring</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational adviser, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">With each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we must not talk to foreigners.</seg>

<seg id="1">The summit of the Unasur ended without the Declaration of Lima is made public</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency reported at the outset that he would be released after the close of the summit, then said that it would be published from time to time on the website of the Peruvian government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.</seg>
<seg id="5">The access to information about the summit has constantly been limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, audio restricted" was published in the press room.</seg>
<seg id="7">The little information circulating among the journalists were those given by the press secretary to some of the governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important news.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that has reached the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd Summit of the Arab American Sud-Pays (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been applied with the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published in March.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the two international event, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems to secure transmission for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Summit also concluded with a joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at regional meetings and declared that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear from the parties in the lawsuit that was brought against Santiago and Lima that begins Monday in The Hague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"We will respect the verdict and implemented will resolve disputes that we have today in this international court," said President Humala his Chilean counterpart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international courts," added the President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after that Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua regarded it as seriously flawed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Rouseff, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.</seg>
<seg id="21">The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Among the agreements adopted, he said that the countries of the Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship through the development of agreements on the residence permit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He informed that action would be put in place to improve the "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for a better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triumphalist but should help increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples," concluded the President Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, particularly in rural areas and cross-border pooling our country... and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian president in a speech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among these, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the underlying themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its integration within the Union of South American Nations," which it is currently excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need that Latin America is a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another issue at the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday to Mexico to calmly discuss maritime dispute through the ICJ ruling requested by Bogota.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We will review all these routes, they are not comprehensive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua is going to have a discussion with this country," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible," added the President Santos.</seg>
<seg id="34">The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the transfer of power to the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Similarly, in the context of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet prior to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="37">Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.</seg>

<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa said that he does not regret his decision, because it does not itself has betrayed its principles, but he instead met its "deep democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">It concluded that at the time, "there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Moreover, he criticizes the Swedish justice who demanded that it puts on its territory to an interrogation concerning an alleged sex crime while "own Swedish legislation can do so by videoconference, what could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had had a lung problem, but nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It affects the health of anyone," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa said that the solution of granted asylum to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stressed that he had had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings from various European bodies," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And he believes that "if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would end."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as the makes it completely its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or being interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that it was "not tolerated mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that interfere with the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians or malicious perverse but bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this light, it welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador," and instead of putting forward his re-election, "he approfondirait the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should stand firm and not Tolerating opportunism and the attempted coup in disguise," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What is more, the president of Ecuador as "entirely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment, this judgment is not respected.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a problem between a country and a South American country.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.</seg>
<seg id="29">We must resolve them together to overcome them and move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said that it is "beneficial that Latin America understands the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a firm judgment if it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa has ensured that, if he lost the primary to February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations that are as unfair as those of Ecuador, the socio-economic poverty can only be solved through the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement was believed that it was me who ensured that possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from politics.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, I will.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This is my decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man has hidden from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take one of his illness and began to inquire about him and his determination was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV civil hospital in Guadalajara (hCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even then, the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say hello to him "because he was speechless."</seg>
<seg id="9">In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignoring their disease, many people still when the virus has already caused the damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported case, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the unit of HIV of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The infectiologue and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed the patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for people do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those at a rate of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Put simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis in 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years," explained the scientists interviewed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To put it in context, it should know that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients were on the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So why is there still of death?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">I think the problem is not with access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">Over the last 12 years at least, we have never failed to drugs, the problem is that the patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know they are infected, or when they learn in advanced stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is conducting earlier diagnoses and, for that, it must offer testing, to all who request them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The specialists and the members of the Council of State of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves as Fabrizio, who had to make its screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma, a cancerous tumour which is one of the complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some believe that they will die and don't want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke three times per week," they say, this is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.</seg>
<seg id="28">To this day, her parents know only that he suffers from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I have a normal life, just like anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsible, I pay attention to me and to the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share its Intimité with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who fear today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they should know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms on the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">There are many gap between health and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest lies in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In all the places dedicated to this, "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we gave packets of 100, which is fine, but the result, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections were teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The question, "What are you going to do?" asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, ensures the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="39">It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at the counters, but they were found in the distributors of public toilets and where the young.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not to encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nor is it to pay them the girls and the motel, as had reduced the Governor Emilio Gonzalez when he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not how it works sexuality, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The figures in Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV listing).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state is the fourth state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of HIV infections are sexually, 6% through the blood and 2% by perinatal route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, as for each recorded cases, there are four or five people who do not know him.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A judgement ratified on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro granted via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. the scenario causes a negative precedent for all transnational corporations with influence in neighboring countries and having solvency problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the starry banner, field of international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment of 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution will allow the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to enter the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of the insolvency of businesses with a national profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, the law of the Model United Nations Feel the Commercial Law International had been established for this purpose by the American Law Institute as arbitrator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgement stated that without the vote intersociétés, recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries of the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here there is a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of the Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed the debts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Moreover, what is certain is that, because there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, of all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A fact omitted by the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis that confronted the United States, reflecting the costs to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For now, the family society González Sada interjettera appealed to the same court of appeal for the vote to be held in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The use of insurance and reclaim non-prospérité requires a retrial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on corporate bankruptcy, noting that the freed up agreements signed by the two countries to reach the same level as in paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In addition, he noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set out for the cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Pile-up of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they shocked the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">General Review</seg>

<seg id="22">The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the head of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration union, the Association des Pilotes Lights has already encountered problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The forum, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau just presented a demand against the National Securities and Banking Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Héctor "Hetin Reyes'" basketball is my life. "</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The showing of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin Reyes."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage was condemning the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, the OBS, with Vaqueros from Bayamón or as chairman of the basketball federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the Federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball is my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes did not exaggerate when he made that statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that recall his itinerary, witness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all her memories, those he loves the most are those that remind its passage as the player within the team of Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"This has been my best years, those for which I am most benefited because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, either as manager, co-manager or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here, and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a big player for you, measuring two meters.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was a better shots.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Mincy had resulted in Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">He welcomed the championship with Gausse Vaqueros, but only at a distance since 1988 it was already the honcho of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hasn't been playing the last game, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team of the 1990 World is the best national team that you view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the best, like that which beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have taken a beating in the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all predictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">That was the best Puerto Rican leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the OBS employed up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">You can do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalization of the minor categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, the boys of Ponce play only in their area and are the only teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff spots.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the youth travel and play too when it is not necessarily needed.</seg>
<seg id="45">I've at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="46">It makes me happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing today?</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The actor Larry Hagman</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became internationally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous businessman, formidable and manipulative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was 81.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production of "Dallas."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role ironic that he loved the most," said the family.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He brought joy to all those who knew him.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it will greatly miss.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It was an exceptional person and he lived life in substance," Gray said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The doctors had diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver to Larry Hagman in 1992 and admitted he had drunk a lot for many years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 1995, he was detected a malignant liver and he had undergone a liver transplant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Years before "Dallas," Hagman had made known to television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams," broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.</seg>
<seg id="15">In it, he interpreted the role of Capt. Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius attractive, played by Barbara Eden, and he brought it home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He also played in two comedies that have remained little time to the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).</seg>
<seg id="17">Among his roles in the movies, there are roles well received by critics in the "Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously stable J.R. that Larry Hagman underwent its greatest success.</seg>
<seg id="19">The CBS drama series of the Ewing clan and their relatives ran from April 1978 to May 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The slogan "who killed J.R.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in bets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record audience at this time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers on average were in front of their screens and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "Mash" celebrations in 1983, which had collected 50 million viewers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This was the sister of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.</seg>
<seg id="24">J.R. Raashidoon pregnant and had threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people had also reasons to attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a man and insatiable but charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and a faithful husband who tried to confine his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I know what it would be like epitaph for Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm," Hagman said in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="27">We should write: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."</seg>
<seg id="28">Here are the only party that he lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste from the original series, recalled Hagman Friday as a man of "immense, both on the small screen as in life."</seg>
<seg id="30">It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.</seg>
<seg id="32">The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">For the moment, neither Warner nor the channel TNT made on how will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">From Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the celebrity with classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."</seg>
<seg id="35">Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">He made his first step on the scenes of the theaters of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="38">The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities.</seg>

<seg id="39">In 2001, he called his memoir "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': the ruthless memories of Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm)</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A course of the "end of the world" has just begun</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the NDG, viruses and germs and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he launched an irresistible hook: the end of the "Great count" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the imminent end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited them over the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian thinkers of the end of the time thought to trigger the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I never realized that it would be half the apocalyptic more than I've ever seen," said Professor Charmé this week to his students from the Université Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we already told, this has been a very good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the only teacher to teach courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Temple, an assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption "media, culture and end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the NDG, viruses and germs and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios to guide a certain human conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, could be a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropologie, have teamed up to teach a course simply entitled "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We add" 2012 "to have the chance to offer the course again, if the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the looming disaster, "students must study, create projects and spend their final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student choice other than to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The course proved to be quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about its course for students of high level, composed of 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the share of people who asked if there was still space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It fascinates me to see what people are capable of doing to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23, of Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether religious or secular, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Wekesa Will, a student in Psychology and nurse for 25 years, claims to have viewed the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I appreciate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students interviewed, and even less a professor, told us believe in the end date of the world of 21 December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," says Julie zegle, a student of last year at Temple, 21 years of age and from West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But I admit that there is an anxiety-related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="34">The majority of the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded when asked if he knew that we gave here courses on "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines are not at the end of the world," we responded, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a grace of the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall pointed out that over the years, we have talked about the supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or to philosophize on the fact that the 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The students and teachers took the date lightly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several have told us that they thought they were going to parties "to the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Sometimes, I called friends and we rigolons together," said Samira Ford, a student communications from 20 years ago.</seg>
