The NSA case underlines the total absence of debate on intelligence
</seg>
<seg id="2">
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side is frustrated in public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and the other prohibits the overflying the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumours of the presence aboard of Edward Snowden?
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
When Fran√ßois Hollande to phone Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance on communications in France.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart the reproduction of the US diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the Quai d 'Orsay eavesdropping by the NSA?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Is there not as a vague hypocrisy?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enable every citizen to form an opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on analysis by the American diplomacy or other political issues in the world, we believe that, in the light of American power, this is an important fixture.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
When we describe the interception American systems against the French diplomacy in the US, this is not to be outraged at this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
France has benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations aimed our interests?
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Can we lose the American collaboration?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools very powerful interception by the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have procedures in place for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described by both sides as essential.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas to Miranshah was reported to the French with the means of the NSA.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
France may be driving, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and in return - has already been said - quickly, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
So the question of substance behind the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to build interception tools, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of attacks on freedoms.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
That is a real risk the United States? A deterioration of their image?
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is fine to denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The risk for Americans may be double.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes to the top of their state, have been monitored.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States have soured.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies balk, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers are subject to American laws, and thus to the grip of the NSA.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Last point: the vast movement of revelations engaged by the world media, which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services until then almost non-existent, could prompt legislators, including American, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services.

Barack Obama receives the Prime Minister of Iraq, skyrocketing violence
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The US president was to receive Friday 1 November 2013 Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence in the past five years.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Iraq has experienced in October the deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
964 people died in the violence in October, 855 civilians, including 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1600 people were injured.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The UN gives stock even higher with 979 deaths and 1902 injured.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The violence is increasingly lethal despite enhanced security measures and military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1073 people had been killed.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence fear a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in the throes of a civil war.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and be the target of unjust arrests, encouraged this outbreak of violence.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al-Qaeda.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The violence is at the heart of talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military involvement in the country, had painted a rosy picture of the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Since arriving Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has intensified its meetings with the executive, and elected representatives in Congress.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Thursday, he pleaded for the international community conducts a "third world war" against Al-Qaeda.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The principle of increased assistance to Iraq's security is supported by influential Senate Republicans and Democrats.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But they have also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, giving partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian politics."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
They also demanded of Barack Obama that he convey to Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."

The Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how the parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and couples of the same sex.
</seg>

The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the requirement to obtain the greatest possible answers.

The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that it takes to smoke a cigarette.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice life of nicotine addiction.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Further testing is needed before commencing tests on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the early signs were encouraging.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"We really hope that this type of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all methods now available on the market, but are discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to develop anti-nicotine antibodies.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The virus infects selectively liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The antibodies stalk all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were eased," said the researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The previous vaccines against tobacco proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The injections were to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells in plants to antibodies.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"They know that if they start to smoke, they will take no pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
British scientists have said that the findings were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.

A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d 'Oise
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The authorities have announced Thursday October 31 that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d 'Oise, clearly foreign origin while France is free of indigenous cases since 2001.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The kitten was found on 25 October at Argenteuil and died on October 28.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and handle individuals who might come into contact with the kitten between October 8 and October 28, included," says ministries of health and agriculture.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Five people have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received a preventive treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after the contact with the animal carrier, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," says the press release.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Departments are now people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, lashed or mucosal skin or aggrieved by this kitten or the animal would have been in contact with the kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 8 November 0 June 1995 between 10.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. from 1 November.

An Australian is appealing his sentence in Thailand
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A woman in Sydney of 21 years, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for having falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Court of Phuket Province on June 15 false statements after he told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who did had assaulted early Sunday 10 June.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
However, the video surveillance recordings were later revealed that she had returned to his hotel after being separated from her boyfriend Australian.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Police in Phuket Bamford was interrogated for two days before she admits to having invented the story.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Bamford was sentenced to a prison sentence of 15 days in a detention centre of low security in the periphery of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is the daughter of former player in the Australian Rugby League Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" for the welfare of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"We have obviously had a scary moment, but we hope to bring home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Bamford has appealed the judgment and has been released after paying a bail of 50000 baht.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on holiday in the area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the death of up to two years imprisonment and confinement in a prison for adults.

However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, a travel agent in Australia, Thailand could also seek to burnish his deteriorated from tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.

Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the Assize Court of the United States in Texas.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
</seg>

<seg id="7">
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones running the Android operating system from Google, which delivers a fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.

<seg id="10">
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose 4.4 billion.

Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The former Labour minister for New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property in the area controlled by the government.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew its leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeid have two restaurants and a cafe, after their expiration in August 2005, but there was bidding.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Now it is investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Assistant Secretary General Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
During the years of discussions initiated in 2005, the government has pushed for the leases are tender.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In 2009, leases of Circular Quay businesses related to Obeid about 2.5 million per year, were renewed without that there is bidding.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the tenders.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who has acknowledged Mr Tripodi, called for a change of government policy in terms of leases.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid to the Department of Fisheries.

FAA: air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not spend an appeal with their mobile phone)
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music ‚Äì but not talk on their mobile phone ‚Äì under the new awaited Guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, " said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules regarding the placement of devices to be in compliance.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The FAA said it had already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"According to the plan, we could approve a wider use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.

Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They are not supposed to relight the before the plane reached an altitude of 10000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices during the descent before landing and not rekindle until the plane has emerged.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Under the new directives, the airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and rolling on the ground, said the FAA.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers could use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, was pleased by these changes.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"Once the new policy implemented safely ‚Äì and we will work closely with carriers for that ‚Äì this will benefit everybody," said Glading in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Frankly we are tired of feeling as "overseers" when it comes to this issue.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10000 feet, said the agency.

Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, an expert in national transport safety on CBS News, said that the phones were still considered at risk.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"The phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation instruments, but because we know from the FCC, they could disrupt the proliferation of mobile phone if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Pressure on the FAA has strengthened in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no reason to valid security for these prohibitions.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The FAA has started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interferences with navigation instruments and communication when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The new airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The airlines allow passengers to use the Wi-Fi for cruising altitudes for several years.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems also can better resist interference.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The vast majority of airliners should allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The electronic devices today generally emit radio power transmissions much lower than previous generations of devices.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Readers of electronic books, for example, emit only minimum transmissions when turning a page.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for an easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In 2011, the leaders of the company instructed an airliner electronic readers of Kindle books and flew to see if there were problems, but there has been no.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
This has inspired the members of the Advisory Committee of the ASF mixed feelings about the question of whether the use of devices present a risk.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the interference from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that the devices may interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allows pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during landings to instruments in low visibility conditions.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, the appellant arrangements full of common sense for travellers equipped with technologies.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant experience is not incompatible with passenger safety," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.

The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the gesture of the United States to relax regulations on electronic devices.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the critical phases of flight, provided that they are in "airplane mode".
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Passengers can already do it for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Australian carriers examine the decision requiring U.S. carriers to make an important work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they have no immediate intention to change their procedures.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has also stated that it considered the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in flight," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The question is the subject of a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security and passengers to meet the safety briefing by crew members.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA its intention to extend the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"We would welcome a review of the CASA, which allows the use of electronic devices because we really do believe this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft," said a spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Qantas said that it did, for the moment the current rules.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"In accordance with our current policy, the electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate intention to change this," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will carefully examine the FAA's decision and the reasons thereof.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depends on the age of their fleet.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, baggage and instructions provided to passengers.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"As soon as an airline has tested the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices such as tablets, readers of electronic books and smartphones at all elevations," said the FAA.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment stowed safely under the seats or in the overhead bins during takeoff and landing.

The CDC publishes tips on allergies in children to schools
</seg>
<seg id="2">
On Wednesday, the US Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has issued a series of directives on how to manage food allergies for children at school.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, since the number of school-age children with food allergies rose strongly.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and on how to deal with them in case of allergic reaction.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine ‚Äì self-injector EpiPen brand is the most commonly used to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Children can say, ' I have the impression that something I piques the language, " " I have the impression of having a hair on the language " or " I tingling on the language. "

A lot of opposition to medical assistance to die in Congress of palliative care
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This is an opportunity for several associations of palliative care to reaffirm their disagreement.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their own lives, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
If we focused on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Chair of the Network of palliative care in Quebec also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
If it is adopted, Alberta D√©ry is concerned about the impact on future generations.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The majority of palliative care homes refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of hospices, Suzanne Fitzback.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the Maison Mathieu-Froment-Savoie Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We never asks: "I want to die, give me an injection."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The director of the Association of palliative care in Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the bill of Quebec misleads people about the vocation of palliative care.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He does not believe that Ontario will follow.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
For its part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stephanie Valle, says that the concept of end of life should be clarified before the bill is adopted.

Halloween 2013: in figures
</seg>
<seg id="2">
When I was small, Halloween was magical.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, to go to bed late and get us to go in the vicinity.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Today, I have become more stingy.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not more this year.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But the stats show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The majority of Americans ‚Äì 158 million of them in fact ‚Äì will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
What I am looking forward to each Halloween celebration, it is the trends.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The costumes should represent 1.2 billion on $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This year, the sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Women no longer need to be sexy; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
For men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the area of Daft Punk will be among our photos Instagram this year.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
According to Google, the most wanted are the disguises, Batman zombies, pirates and witches.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I suppose it is not difficult to remain traditional.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not alone.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This is a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
When it comes to candy, it does not pile.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to the firm Nielsen.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, pacifiers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is a new super for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In fact, we are going to buy, and we do not tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Candy corn is the only thing that we do not want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
This represents approximately 9 billion corn kernels.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is a mystery that I am not yet arrived.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Nothing is more representative of the Halloween haunted houses.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
They are the best names, like "terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "the House of Shock."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In fact, there are 1200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, generating about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these wonderful photos of you peed on you that your friends are on Facebook and that you cannot remove and on which a type that you like to leave a comment of "lovely style head."

Finally, talk about pumpkins.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Charlie Brown has presented The Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin-shaped lantern, it is like decorating a Christmas tree ‚Äì it is something that we do since it is very small.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Fortunately for us, "the tendency of the baby-pumpkin" began only last year through Pinterest, so most of us have carved the pumpkins and did not have to sit in it.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
This year, Americans will spend approximately $106M in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

DRC: the army attack on the last rebel stronghold
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Diehard fans of the M23, a few hundred fighters were dug in almost 2000 metres on the agricultural hills, Chanzu and Runyonyi Mbuzi, relatives of Bunagana and Jomba, two locales at approximately 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continued despite the night," told AFP an inhabitant of Jomba, contacted by telephone around 12.30, and that a girl was shot and injured in the morning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"The intensity of clashes has declined a bit," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed a little rebel."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night at Jomba" before getting to the front for a "sweep operation".
</seg>
<seg id="6">
There was very much behind him crackling fed arms.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In Bunagana, political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations from heavy weapons.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DRC, the fighting came "in a final phase," the FARDC "circled the positions of the residual to dislodge the M23."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Since the resumption on Friday, clashes between the Mouvement du 23 Mars (¬ßM¬ß2¬ß3¬ß) and the army, the Monusco is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides the government troops a crucial intelligence support, monitoring and planning.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, rode toward the front line.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, the military helped civilians directing a multiple rocket launchers mounted on a truck brand nine FARDC to relieve another gear pounding the positions of the M23 on the hills.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called on Wednesday night once again the rebels to "demobilize" voluntarily or be disarmed "by force," but the process has left open in Kampala, Kinshasa and the M23 discussed since December without result for the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"We ended the talks, it only remains to the Ugandan mediation to organise the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information can be confirmed immediately on the government side.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The M23 was born a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mainly Tutsis, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuses Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which refute Kigali and Kampala.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
</seg>

<seg id="5">
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by then the white apartheid government of South Africa in the framework of efforts to destabilize the government of an independent country.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo is mutually blame the tensions.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The Renamo says that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, on 17 October.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The government makes the Renamo responsible for triggering the conflict, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Mr Guebuza said Wednesday to AFP, the French news agency, that Mr Dhlakama is regarded as a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces that he had to try to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Frelimo and Renamo insist they both want to avoid war.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement in 1992.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that do not stop arguing," said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker from the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
None of them knows negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to get concessions and a war chest from the government.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The share of votes collected by the Renamo continues to drop since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, should get a greater number of votes in elections.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza ‚Äì which should withdraw at the end of his second term next year ‚Äì wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"It does not want a multiparty democracy, it does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We do not know exactly what is the capacity of the Renamo, but she has conducted flash disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a motorway north-south axis.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Most clashes have occurred in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where is the Beira port where mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In June, Rio has not been able to use the railways for about a week after the Renamo has threatened to attack the rail line.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Mr Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo r√©it√®rerait this threat.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr Mazanga.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The instability has strengthened the frustrations about the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, a society of independent media, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"People think that the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is to find solutions to problems," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"Nobody cares about the Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to regain peace, they want to have free access to the roads," he added.

Coulson has used the telephone hacking to verify a pipe
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The former editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson would have used "the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a phony hose on a route involving Interior Minister then, Charles Clarke.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty special advisor."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It has been reported to the court that the newspaper asked Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective to hack voicemail to Pawlby and "planted in front of his door," but Coulson has also called and left voice messages.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"The charge suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the house people hoping the surprise, it is the kind of man to love present history for people to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The editor is personally involved in the third.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is obvious that it is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But what about the first?
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He has knowledge of phone hacking?
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He says the opposite, but we say "of course if."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The rumors on a route involving Clarke have been occasions in the first by the office of the editor of NotW when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that he was told: "do not waste your time with it, it is with Charles."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A band, which were recorded voicemail hacked on his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Investigators have also found on the computer seized from private detective Miss Pawlby and his sister were placed in a folder "projects".
</seg>
<seg id="15">
During the period in which the detective has investigated it, grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls asked them about it, Mr Edis said.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of movements of Miss Pawlby.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In a voicemail message he left on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Mr Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about a liaison with a married woman while he was attending the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted having made the phone hacking.

Rescue plan of $325 million for the health system of Tasmania
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The federal government maintains that the rescue plan of $325 million for the health system, which is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government not wasted funds.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The funding over four years, was decided after consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan, which we believe will address the unique challenges the state faces," Ms Plibersek said today.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The $325 million plan included $31 million for elective surgery.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
2600 additional operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Funds are also planned for the walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care, external training frameworks, medical services dedicated to mental health and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, it is the best way to treat the health system of Tasmania," Ms Plibersek said.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Minister said that the government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict regime of reporting and accountability.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the extra funds.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
A panel of three people will be established to ensure that the state provides the most effective and efficient way possible.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million do not count for much "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen the public health system of Tasmania."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He applauded the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance he has presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I hope that the federal assistance will contribute greatly to withdraw the public health system of Tasmania from the black list," Mr Wilkie said.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
According to the state government, these additional elective procedures largely reverses the recent cuts.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But the spokesman for the opposition health Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "a makeshift solution."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"The reason why we are here is that the Labour government of the state withdrew $430 million of its health system," he said on ABC TV.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
We cannot have a government of the state which tears almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which is $300 million, and pretend that it is a good day.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Mr Dutton has visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that no dollar rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
</seg>
<seg id="4">
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5000.

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect the CNN "hero of the year."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This person will receive $250000 to continue its extraordinary work.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father ill alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Initially, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that has spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would be the legacy the rest of his life.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"There was no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
We would taken abroad if we had enough money.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals for any treatment that he could benefit.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"It is not easy," says Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You can leave the house at 5.00 a.m., you rush to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There are many patients.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
People can die because they wait too long.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In comparison, the U.S. ratio is 1 doctor for 413 people.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians may not pay for the consultation.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are made in the private sector.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
After seeing his father and his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical acts for free over the last year.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaounde.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And it has created a humanitarian non-profit association, ASCOVIME, who travels to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Almost every Friday, with some 30 people, they huddle in vans after the medical equipment on the roof and traverse difficult terrain to the villages that need help the most.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Luck does not always.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
They have repeatedly pushed the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: the community organizes a feast, sing and dance and offers them the best available housing.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In these villages, the free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle ‚Äì with his big smile and boundless energy ‚Äì is more than happy to join in the festivities.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"We get 500 people at each visit," said Mr Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Sometimes they live to 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and pests.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a certificate of birth ‚Äì free document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In the evening, the team practice of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The operations are usually performed in a school, a mayor or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes in the recovery room to let its place to the next person.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and sterilizing equipment, Dr. Bwelle and work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
It is a grueling pace, but musicians villages generally help the team to stay motivated.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"They are knocking on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," explained Mr Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
On Sunday, the team returned to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgical acts for free over the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they support.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A man explained that the free operation that he had to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"It is going to change my future and that of my family," said the man.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
In addition to live this mobile hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaound√©.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
This is the second job, he explains, which finances its association with 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
"I do not know when he sleeps," said Katie O 'Malley, a medical student in second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer within the group of Dr. Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
It is still in the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to conduct these campaigns.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O 'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in its missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they have no home.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"We were able to participate in operations to help stanch the blood or get the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," explained Miss O 'Malley.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
This is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in second year.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Volunteer students generally pay their journey in Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
But once in Yaound√©, their pensions, transport and education are borne by Dr. Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"It is a hero, there is no doubt," said Katie O 'Malley.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not abate.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
For Dr. Bwelle, workload relatively constant is not a difficulty.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Helping others to live happily with the promise he made to his father is something that she is a great joy.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
"I am so happy when I do this work," added Mr Bwelle.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
And I think of my father.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
I hope he sees what I do.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Making people laugh and pain are the reasons that lead me to do that.

The two France Pierre Nora
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Professor in lecture theatres and classrooms?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
No doubt, but by highlighting its low for the paths, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
</seg>
<seg id="5">

</seg>
<seg id="7">
Heir of the wheelchair occupied Fontenelle to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Still, but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the real holy oil, the thesis that it happened.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They have readily recognised in him a great champion, facilitator and uniting their work, but noting that he was reluctant to produce himself.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This image was uncertain the monument "sites of memory", in which he has attached his name, also contributed.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The nasty languages have been able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator with a keen eye and ballasted erudition, but hopelessly dilettante.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The two books published by Nora nearly two years have already established that was not to write a lot and was well written.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The book that should make him definitively justice.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
There is yet again, the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual, promiscuous jubilation as step from one topic to another.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects assembled in this beautiful book under the dealer back to one and the same passion: discover the constituent node of the French identity.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Identity: it is a matter of time.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Recently, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
But in the minds of our leaders peremptory, French identity was a timeless essence.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It had to deploy in accidents, and the matter requires Jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, interpreters allowed.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
That stalking Pierre Nora is quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It is not an heir of an eternal French, he refuses to the definition.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Worried an analyst familiar strangeness, he wandered in a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by an object in the form of a riddle, tormented of irritating questions.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Including this one, which is the company itself: why, in a country so durably installed within its borders, if formerly constitution and solidly stonework, it is these dramatic calls for unity?
</seg>
<seg id="25">
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to stave off the disorder born discord in French history.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here are very old.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And most emblematic is obviously that cleaves the two national history.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
After the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, the monarchy, the other a revolutionary.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The second sought to the death of the first, but did not reach the deny; anxious instead of finding the sanctity and all the more eager of unity and indivisibility that it had cut the lead to that was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
And, from there, a nation invinciblement binary, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
To feel this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four outside of France, so the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to build a new society.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
But the American view is that better highlight what we own.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
There, men who had let their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Here, men crowded indigenous Old Regime, and even more radical.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
A consensual revolution here when she sowed the drama and the confit.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionaries whose ancestors are hard to make models, and among the rest.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
An institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as errors to catch up and trials to resume.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
France going, France comes
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could mend the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the figure.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
At the Third Republic, central time and creator, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who are employed to repair the fracture, revolutionary teaching schoolchildren everything in the old France preparing obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
But that identity has had a peaceful time.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Here again in debate, shoved by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European area.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The book thus provides a fascinating portrait of France and the cautious sketch of France.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
With the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
It says that the chemineau was a homely.

The man multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The prowler edges stood at the center of the center.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And anyone who had filed for more than a half-century, a topic on the idea of nation, but was removed from the exercise of the Initiatic thesis, says, cum grano salis, that it will eventually do so.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Admittedly in a gentler, more fragmented and more subtle form.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But let us make no mistake, equally binding.

How biometrics will invade our lives
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Passwords typing for accessing its smartphone or pay its purchases?
</seg>
<seg id="3">
American, French or Japanese researchers we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that even the century will be "biometric".
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person conducting transactions in such a universe and transverse transnational Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but worry about it.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In 2011 alone, and in France, the Commission nationale de l 'informatique et des libert√©s authorised 774 systems of fingerprint recognition, the shape of the hand or Venule hand in businesses, administrations, canteens...
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime," upset Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy within the TRC (Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism among others?
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Biometrics will rely on new techniques which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and Venule palm and fingers.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"For example, some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity of Thales Communications & Security.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And the collection and verification of Venule and contour of the hand involves a voluntary gesture and specific people.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is both a security - you cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure shall be repeated at times and therefore takes time.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
A result, research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the coloured part of the eye).
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the sensors and computational power of computers needed for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The accuracy of facial recognition has grown tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of R Accenture laboratories in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed border crossings using automatic facial recognition.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is now possible to identify a face or a moving iris.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Single and unfalsifiable, DNA marker also raises hopes and concerns.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
NEC offers the services of judicial police suitcase costing 90000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: the identification (recognize a person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is that it claims to be).

The identification was so far the issuance of identity papers: we must confront the biometrics (fingerprints, iris photo) with the information that the state has on all citizens already on file.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
This ensures that a person does not try to impersonate someone else.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This principle of comparison may have other applications.

Ways to reassure users
</seg>
<seg id="42">
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The first is to explain that it can save time.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"If, through biometrics, a client remains in cash thirty seconds less, it is significant," says the director of a large area.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server can recognize your voice and offer tailored options.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"The fingerprints are stored on a server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which freezes if it tries to move on," lists Philippe Robin, Thales.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
But the lack of comprehensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The protection of privacy, continue to worry.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"The progress of the facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: a widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, the Office of the privacy protection in Canada.

Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on flights.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for up to $100 for a handbag, $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the unopened spool with them on the descent.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The new baggage fees on bags stowed in the overhead compartment, so the baggies installed underneath the seat will always be free.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers paid only once at the gate.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The spokesman for Frontier, Kate O 'Malley said that the $100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay in advance.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were as much as they could in hand baggage stowed in the overhead bins, and often there was more room in these compartments.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
O 'Malley said that these new charges will not be used to collect money.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It is about understanding the most loyal customers of Frontier that it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the overhead bins.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline will not have to pay.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
For example, a passenger queuing at a gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, whereas the next person in the tail may have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
O 'Malley explained that the site and registration procedures of Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these fees before arriving at the door.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The cost of hand baggage of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Passengers often nag about baggage fees and other costs, but airlines love.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
They believe that the baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want the service should pay for it.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Yet many of them have not affected at the expense of luggage.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant has followed a little later.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the airlines consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the costs extra.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He estimated in a report in December 2011, that the cost of hand luggage Spirit reported $50 million per year.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Sorensen, a former part of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers would experience the baggage charges unusual imposed by the company.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"I had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a brawl breaking out at the door.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at lightning speed."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Frontier is also like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or juice.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juices can carry the can not open with them, and those who take coffee can be resservis free.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
She always distribute water free of charge.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
US Airways has briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but fell back seven months later after passengers complained, and while no other major airline had followed.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The decision of Frontier to pay baggage fees when passengers do not buy their tickets directly with the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go on its site.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The airlines pay to online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
This has prompted airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them instead of talking to an online travel agency.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In September, it has begun to offer only half of loyalty miles to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
On Wednesday, it has reduced the bonus miles by 25% on a trip.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Thus, a Frontier travel 1000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the site of Frontier.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Frontier has a loyal base in its home city of Denver, but its activity is declining and it loses money.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Revenues fell by 9% and flight capacity has fallen by nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Republic has tried to put the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.

Scientists come to highlight how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Previous studies had shown that the dogs happy remuaient more their tail to the right (the dog), while the nervous dogs the remuaient more towards the left.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "everyone knows that, in humans, the left and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that are positive or negative emotions."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Here, we tried to see what it was in other species.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He added that as well as in humans, dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
To learn more about how dogs react to tail disorderly movements other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching films featuring other dogs.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They measured the frequency of heart animals and analyzed their behavior.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
We must certainly not long before we understand why their tail will sometimes on one side and sometimes the other.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Professor Vallortigara explained: "we have presented to dogs films featuring other dogs ‚Äì a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors ‚Äì and we were able to peddle the movement of the tail and present it as going to the left or right."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
When the animals have seen a dog expression without disturbing the tail to the right (from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But when they spotted a tail mainly shifted to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate has accelerated and they looked anxious.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate among themselves through these movements.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Instead, he believes the dogs know the movements they should or should not worry.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He added: "if you have several times other dogs and if you notice that most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you respond on the basis of this experience."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The researchers suggest that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right for canines.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turning the head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyous dog.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "the dogs would more easily into a robot dog when its tail was waging to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious ‚Äì the opposite of what is contained in the Italian study."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not entirely animals films or robots as dogs dogs.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, " he said.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"Although many elements, among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified ‚Äì and dogs are no exception," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, we must certainly not long before we understand why the tail moves sometimes on one side and sometimes the other.

Obama puts an end to wiretaps for the IMF and the World Bank

Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end that it was tapping on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank within the framework of its intelligence activities, a US official, on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to resume the hand in the case of the NSA's eavesdropping after the revelations by the former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This is the first time that the surveillance is mentioned the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Asked about the subject, an official of the US administration replied: "the US does not conduct electronic surveillance for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Speaking in anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance was implemented in the past.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another official has indicated that Barack Obama had given orders to stop such practices in recent weeks.

The Congolese army chasing rebels of the M23
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would chase the rebels of the M23 in their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The M23 is about to be beaten after being chased out of the localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) he controlled from the beginning, there are 20 months of the insurgency.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"We will continue the M23 and cornering wherever it is hiding because they are criminals," said Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We must not let them reorganize because they martyrisent the Congolese people for too long.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The time has come to bring peace.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Officials from the M23 explained have evacuated localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setback does not alter its claims to peace talks.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Skirmishes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
At their peak in November, the insurgents have occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the leak of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
For its part, the staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the M23, change the course of the war.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The pace of government troops today is unprecedented.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"The M23 appears to be coming to an end," predicted an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government of Kinshasa managed to beat a major insurgency.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group ally in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
</seg>

John Kerry conceded, is without precedent, that the American espionage had gone too far "inappropriately"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
John Kerry has indicated a radoucissement the defensive attitude of the United States vis-√†-vis its surveillance programs assuming unprecedented that on several occasions, espionage had gone too far "inappropriately."
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Secretary of State has also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA has emerged.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "it is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have seen some things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He then became the first senior member of the United States government to admit that the American espionage had overstepped the mark, but insisted that rights were not violated.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He said: "in some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."

And the President is committed to try to clarify and make clear to people that it was now a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I assure you that the innocent people will not be abused in this process.

Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good acting and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.

He added: "we live in a new world where people are ready to blow."

Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to meet concerns about the case of alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need for further joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations because of the sense of frustration about the supervision of the National Security Agency.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans are still with us in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the US Senate, in an interview from Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some allies of the United States, however, the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The intelligence chief, James Clapper, has justified spying on allies by saying that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said that his office organized a trip to the Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The names of the other participants legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He said that the route remained to be determined.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "tough love".
</seg>
<seg id="26">
He explained that the European Heads of State had to be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs that they apply themselves for years.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to conduct espionage," said Murphy.
</seg>

Meanwhile, Kerry has planned to travel this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment caused by the US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the monitoring activities of the United States.

For the CEO of Titan, "the proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
After having thrown in the towel, noisily in January for the partial resumption of site Goodyear Amiens-Nord promised closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumaticien Titan, declares today, ready to save 333 jobs on 1137 in the factory.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive recovery, had already announced, Monday 21 October.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Having abandoned the plan to purchase the plant in January, you come back today.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of " so-called workers " who work three hours a day, " " crazy " unions, the CGT.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We do not understand this volte-face.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Is it to please Mr Montebourg?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I was trying to please anyone.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Except my wife.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
If I hurt someone by my words, I am sorry.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But France has a high level of taxes and unemployment.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The truth is hurting you?
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Working seven hours a day when other countries working eight hours underdevelops France.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In India, China and other countries, working 10 to 12 hours a day.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But I have no prejudices on France.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
What I see, it is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good facilities, is well located and has space to expand.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Why Titan has so much need this plant?
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Titan did not need to buy the plant.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But, with the right price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
What kind of agreement you between the CGT and Goodyear?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I believe that 100% of employees have accepted.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Now, imagine that Titan buys Goodyear closed the plant.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union, which still has its own currency.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I think that Mr Montebourg knows this.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
However, he wants to keep the plant in Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Titan accepts to recruit among the approximately 1200 current employees of Goodyear.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Mr Montebourg he need a commitment from Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Therefore, there will be more employees in the plant.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Mr Montebourg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs over four years.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The confirmation?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The only number that I mentioned at the minister, it is 333.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I know he would like a guarantee of four years.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
If all employees accept the plan to purchase the plant starts with zero employee.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
How can we give guarantees of employment tenure when there are no more employees on the site?
</seg>
<seg id="38">
If Mr Montebourg manages to what the CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buys the factory, we intend to remain in Amiens-Nord over four years.

We should teach the myths and legends to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.

The Legend of Thor could show that "brute force is no match for the subtle trick," while the celtic legends revealed the importance of having a dream.

New demand for collective action against the brothers Sainte-Croix
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A new application of collective action was lodged against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that took place this time in Saint Joseph's Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", which would have been masturb√© in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher brother Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, Saint Joseph's Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The first resort was only three institutions, and when it was announced the settlement, many people told us: "I was in such a place that I can subscribe?" Said lawyer Alain Arsenault, which defends the victims in the two applications.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The collective redress just filed makes to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Croix.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
At present, the appeal brings complaints of 25 people who say they have been assaulted by the brothers Sainte-Croix.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the targeted institutions have closed in the 1960s.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The appeal also emphasises that the congregation of St. Croix and St. Joseph's Oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children," they have had a "moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims," they "were aware of sexual abuse and have suffocated," and that they have "knowingly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
These accusations are based on, among other letters written by the brothers ' lawyer Sainte-Croix, Me √âmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research in the archives on this subject by brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Holy Cross brother who publicly denounced the abuse.
</seg>
<seg id="10">

The court blocked a decision on the policy of control and search of the NYPD
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A federal appeals court has blocked Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the program of monitoring and search of the New York Police Department and has divested of the record.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Court of Appeal of the United States (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal by the city.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The city appealed its conclusions and its corrective orders, including a decision to allocate a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Court of Appeal heard arguments Tuesday on the request for suspension.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be divested of the dossier because it breached the code of conduct for judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men under their control and search.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It has appointed an external auditor to oversee the changes, including the reform policies, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the neighbourhoods where the greatest number of controls.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In August, New York City has agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The hearing of the appeal by the city should be held after March 14, 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The tactics of control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights activists.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This system of control and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level ever in 2011 with 684330 controls that were primarily black and Hispanic men.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Supporters advocating changes in the monitoring program and search of the NYPD say they will end the unfair practices, enable police forces more effective and we trust, and will change the way police departments use the policy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without cutting crime would be a waste of money and do not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been greatly reduced over the last decade.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The judge stressed that it did not put an end to the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but reformed how the NYPD implements its controls.

A tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble of London
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Treasury has provisionally costed the extent of the tax on capital gains but is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborne in the budget for 2012, entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than ¬£ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties within the framework of a society rather than individually.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents ¬£ 708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber region.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Mr Cook said: "following the increase in the stamp duty on the high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the system of residential tax obsolete."

A study to multiply the benefits of rail project HS2 to Scotland was launched by the British government.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that the high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start at the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "would bring together the United Kingdom."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to the idea of working with the British government on the project.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
When Phase 2 will be completed, the lines serve Manchester and Leeds.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In June, the government has revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from 32.7 billion to ¬£ 42.6 billion pounds.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to explore strengthening rail capacity and improving the length of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Baroness Kramer said: "our objective for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We push the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Without him, we are facing a problem of capacity of our rail network.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that they are better with HS2.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has called Mr Carmichael to support "unequivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Mr Brown said: " the high-speed train has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also makes the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network across Britain.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
" So we are thrilled to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the network of high-speed train to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.

The UN welcomes the new objectives in the fight against poverty

The United Nations will start now to work on a new series of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
</seg>

Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The male or female neonates will no longer be awarded their rigidly at birth.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to disclose the sex of their child, allowing them to enter a sex "indeterminate" or "unspecified" on his birth certificate.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions about surgery of sexual reassignment for their babies, and to combat discrimination against the intersex people.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
According to the BBC, intersexed person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created scar face bruised.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is estimated that one in 2000 children born each year, is not a boy or a girl.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They are intersex, intersex part of the 60 diseases diagnosed disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads (ovaries or testes atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Wallis Simpson could be intersexed.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to allocate and then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, as appropriate.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and an expert on issues of sexual identity, said that the new German law "appears to be a good idea."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but this is not the case for most of the children," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how the identity develops.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Nobody can answer the question of why this occurs.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is like the mystery surrounding homosexual people.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological, which is not exclusively that of a man and a woman exclusively, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
These characteristics can be manifested themselves in secondary sex characteristics (such as the muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), the primary sexual traits (such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs) or structure of chromosomes and hormones.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced the intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Young boys of non-compliant have now camps specifically targeting them.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized "neutral" after winning his appeal, which allows it to keep an "unspecified" sex life.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The German passports will have a third designation alongside M or F ‚Äì X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this Catholic country fundamentally signed a petition for the "gender theory" is removed from school books.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The American Catholic online site also objected to the German law, writing that "because the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, it reverses two other pillars of civilization."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that one sex is attributed to babies at birth.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the site for young parents.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Children need stability and certainty.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Historically, children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And there is barely a decade, the medical community considered gender as a slate, we can erase and on which we can redesign.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But now, many people questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when it grows up.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, phoned the surgeon.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins, who considered that the genus is malleable.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that the social and environmental signals ‚Äì how parents raising a child ‚Äì interact with genes and hormones of a child to shape the order that he be identified as male or female.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
But in a case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan," his theories have given rise to controversy.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
He advised parents of a boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to castrate him entirely, by removing the testicles, and raise a daughter.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"Money has presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
At the age of about 15 years, he became a boy and married a woman.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
But at age 38, he committed suicide.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
</seg>
<seg id="45">
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex change operations say that "they are not satisfied with the outcome."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY males but ambiguous sexual organs.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that it could never have a "satisfactory" life as a man.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone surgery to remove the external body and testicles and raised as a girl.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
He has been taking female hormones at the age of 12 years.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"I knew that I was not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
At 18, he suffered a vaginoplastie.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical file.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
What he found was horrified.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I was sterilized at birth ‚Äì and nobody I was never told.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body to produce enough testosterone to its sexual organs can develop.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment with testosterone and is removing the breasts.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The surgery has made him sterile.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Today, he champions the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to standardize the collection of intersex people.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "invites labelling and stigma."
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an" indeterminate "sex," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
We fear that it encourages interventions.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported the Australian law "because it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex."
</seg>
<seg id="66">
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
The German law granting sex at birth.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This is not a battle that young children should lead to this age.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law "empower" parents and children.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS syndrome called complete androgen insensitivity.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
She has a vagina, but no womb or ovaries.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
Now aged 29, Katie is married internal and child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
"The law allows some latitude to parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a deadline before entering "male" or "female."
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Thus, everything is going well ‚Äì you can raise your child and love it.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
You do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
Finally, the child will decide what sex he/she feels the most comfortable ‚Äì and it is something great.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.

He says that Obama has made laudable efforts thwarted by the Republican Party obstructionism
</seg>

Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site nor the drone attacks
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The memory of the Obama 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might happen
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in her second year of medicine in the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
I am reading a book horribly sad these days.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is a book, I thought, I would encourage during the bleakness of the 2 year of medicine and giving me hope.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is called "the Audacity to Win" and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
When I finished the minutes of my medical patients in the evening and that I lie, this book I remm√®ne when policies inspired millions of people and the speeches were breathtaking.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The election ended with a landslide victory and presenters newspapers news took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
My comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers that they have found.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A young visionary team progressed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
During the transition period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82%.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And then I close the book.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The return to this is a difficult, it is like waking from a dream.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
I put to credit Obama's great achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act affordable care) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Furthermore, I believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guant√°namo, among other things.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration to deal with my peers and my colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I am on the brink of political desperation.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, nor the foreign children innocent attacks by drones.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ' privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdeeds.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It cannot justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overspending authorized during presidential campaigns.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are "more aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the failure to devise a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
I do not know if that is what I expected.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Obviously, the election is not predictable, because the opposition party and political events that occur by chance, as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of the administration.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
That is what bothers me the most.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I have voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthralled by his candidacy.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Mitt Romney was confused and a little refined alternative that did not seem to determine its policies or its positions.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would take the promises we heard for so long.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Yet, while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
It makes me wish the many promises that have soared.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primary.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
At a meeting after the campaign, he told his team that they had to recover on the right track and remain loyal to their cause.

RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the dossier, which shows once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspicions of market manipulation of currency is beginning to bear fruit.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigations into the most important financial market in the world, where 5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The bank, which has refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Last month, sources close to the dossier said that RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as head of European cash trading for currencies in JPMorgan.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European FX spot trading at Citi, has been put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
None of these traders has been the subject of any charge.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The record of Mr Usher included instant messages sent to and from bankers working for Barclays and Citigroup, said sources close to the dossier.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In the world, at least six authorities ‚Äì the European Commission, Finma, the authority of the Swiss competition Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ‚Äì examine the allegations made about bankers who agreed to manipulate the rates on the foreign exchange market.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the dossier.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find wrongdoing.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The news about these investigations shook traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies which limits opportunities for speculators.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast foreign exchange market highly liquid, but the senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of foreign exchange transactions daily, the fragmentation of liquidity between the platforms of management of trade and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at little cost."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The news came the same day that Cr√©dit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office funds negotiated the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control," said a representative of Credit Suisse.

A Chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal "will be redrafted"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A Chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of libel will be redrafted, says a regulator of the press.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The New Express, based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
But Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public corporation.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The order of "realignment" comes from the administration of Guangdon for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News, had published several articles on the erroneous listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"The New Express editorial was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He indicated that he had decided to impose a sanction of an administrative nature to Chen Yongzhou withdrawing his press card. "
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He also ordered the "Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it is investigating those responsible in New Express and immediately revises the management team of the newspaper."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on financial irregularities alleged a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But Mr Chen then emerged on a public television station where he admitted having published false stories for money.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"In this case, I have hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence," he said to the public television network CCTV.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I realized my mistake.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Following the apology from Mr Chen, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Experts say that people are routinely forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself.

Obama backtracked on its reform of the health system
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama was back on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
</seg>
<seg id="3">
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their providers, Republicans criticized the president in recent days, accusing it of misleading the American people.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted his promise of origin.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Speaking of what he calls "a boom in the news" about the terminations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received the notice to seek a new insurance on the market.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Most people will be able to get comprehensive health systems and better suited for the same price, even for even cheaper than expected.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"You will win," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who get their insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Ms Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market had "failed miserably".
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.

The tribute to folk of Coen brothers
</seg>
<seg id="2">
"Inside Llewyn Davis" des fr√®res Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village in 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has been the subject of a retrospective at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise, had raided the Palme d 'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If Dylan or hire the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have placed on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In this film, full of humor where music is a central character and the songs online, Oscar Isaac is a musician and folksinger accomplished, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
About Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby" magnificent for less glamorous clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the expletive debited the machine gun when she speaks.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week on the tribulations of a folksinger who fails to break through and get annoyed with the whole world.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
He reluctantly accepts the cuff replacements in the studios.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Without housing, he toured sofas of friends who want to even receive it.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
An air of documentary
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Its relationship with the success is tortured, that is what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not a careerist but integrates with a self-destructive behavior," said the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel Oscar and Cannes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
If Llewyn Davis has not existed, the two filmmakers folk fans have built their story on real personalities of the era as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, the neighborhood of New York to become "the epicenter of the folk music boom that would generate international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The film then takes the style of documentary, the music label dusty invaded of unsold 33T inhabited by an old smile, secretary to the choice of music studios at the time and caf√©s where were the singers.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who crosses the film constantly: a beautiful red cat in crisp, makeshift companion of Llewyn Davis.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Asked about the way he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled "grew up in Tennessee, surrounded by blues and country."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"My first music lessons I received from my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is required to be considered "good", "serendipity can also launch the career of someone," and "increasingly today."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
As Llewyn Davis refusing any compromise on his music, the pop star says in a career, "the most important thing is not to be cornered by anything that can stop us to express ourselves."

Chevron, the second American oil company, reported Friday a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline of its refining margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining receding from the objectives of the group.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to 4.95 billion, or 2.57 per share, compared to 5.25 billion, or 2.69 dollars per share, a year earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Analysts surveyed by Reuters based on average earnings per share of $2.71.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The company is 2.65 million bpd for this year, with growth of 25% of production expected by 2017.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Because of the cost of these projects, the annual capital expenditure increased by seven billion dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36.7 billion in 2013.

Profits of production activities have decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.

NSA spying: the United States are "gone too far," admits Kerry
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The United States sometimes went "too far" espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
</seg>
<seg id="3">
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, it is the first time that a US government explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA by the interception of communications and data in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"In some cases, I admit, as did the president, some of these actions went too far and we will ensure that it does not happen again in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London in which he participated since Washington Thursday October 31 via video link.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In his speech, broadcast in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry has assured that the American authorities had foiled many attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"We have actually prevented aircraft fall, explode buildings and that people are murdered, because we were able to be aware upstream of these projects," argued the boss of American diplomacy.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And John Kerry, said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But we are trying to gather information.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "committed to try to clarify and that it was conducting a review of these practices so that nobody feels deceived."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, says the program called MUSCULAR " and conducted with the NSA's British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by the giants of the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
If one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the single month of January - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text or audio or video.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link with these practices.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, revealed that the NSA would massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Facing the wrath of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama has refused to speak about it, citing national security.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
By contrast, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has received tens of millions of communications of European citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
He even returned the ball to European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing the NSA.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This would include " military operations " in countries where these NATO allies would cooperate with the United States and it would absolutely not do Europe, " said General Alexander.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
And the controversy spread Friday to Asia.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Indonesia summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage has also attracted the ire of China.

Puberty: aging sooner
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than young white girls.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
</seg>
<seg id="4">
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family issues and child health.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A mother should worry if breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow at 7 or 8 years?
</seg>
<seg id="9">
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, soil endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents ‚Äì in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The obvious signs of development, such as the budding breasts, hair under the arms and the pubic area and body odours, appear earlier in girls.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But there has been only a slight edge to the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when he was 12 years, three-quarters in 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"Once the chest began to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "early Puberty in Girls: the Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The time is the more accurate test to find out how puberty will evolve.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
There is a debate about what constitutes the real onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In most cases, development slows or stops ‚Äì it is something that a pediatrician can monitor.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A more rapid evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to stave off serious problems like tumors and cysts.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
There are treatments to delay menarche and prevent other consequences: a premature aging bones that can inhibit growth and a small size to adulthood.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Recommendations for medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, the rate of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that "controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and feel for young girls to be different from the others."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young girls have their rules.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has had its first rules for 10 years.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
She returned to school frightened and upset to be the first among his friends.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
There are many theories brought to the attention of the public about the causes of early puberty.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Yet, there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages in the media are responsible.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The boys, like girls reach puberty earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years between the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In this country, the young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than young white girls.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
There are various explanations.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic climate conditions, through genes.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Another problem: although the boys have hair on the face and the younger pubic area, the trend towards a genuine early puberty is not as pronounced among girls.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Other physicians participating in the conference of the PAA stressed the complexity of the subject.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"We must be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a soil endocrinologist working at the hospital for children at Goryeb Morristown, New Jersey.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz said.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.

A former hostage in Lebanon: "the return is quite complicated to manage"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team "Antenne 2" coming filming a demonstration of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 to the creation of the Turkish hostages "hostages in the world," he chairs for several years.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Its main objective: to get the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Held more than 1000 days, the four hostages of photo (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand et Marc F√©ret were released Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Gr√¢ce Wednesday afternoon, they have since reunited with their families.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And try gradually to resume their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"The Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "hostages in the world."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
From the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of 8pm "Antenne 2".
</seg>
<seg id="10">
What are your memories of your release?
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In particular, in Beirut.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
When I am released, I found in the trunk of a car where I meet - without him because he is black - Roger Auque.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He said "it is released," but I am not sure, and I think that we can still be killed.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We are very excited, but also very tense.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is the war, and those who drive we are also very tense.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There are Syrian military.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It arrives on the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The French lead us to the French embassy.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And he had lunch in T-shirt at the French embassy.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Arrived there by helicopter, taking a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
How did your arrival on French soil?
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It lands at Orly.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It is a bit brutal.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There is an incredible stampede.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
And a lot of media.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
When I left there were three television channels.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I come back and there are full.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Descending the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, it is extremely emotional.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Between the airport and home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin leads.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The bikers are doing underfur to make photos and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent certain to mount.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The media pressure is enormous.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
It does not stop, we are well placed to know...
</seg>
<seg id="39">
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to comprehend.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
It comes out of a hole and you are suddenly under the media spotlight.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
It is a bit complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
But it has been the hardest.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
In the evening, I am at 8pm the next day I am on TV.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Then begins a sort of readjusting to life, very slowly, for a month or two that are a bit like a holiday.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
How have passed the medical examinations and debriefing DGSE?
</seg>
<seg id="46">
I had the right to a first medical control in Corsica.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The rest was done in the Val-de-Gr√¢ce days my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This is not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, if necessary, that it is not delivered to ourselves.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is part of the procedure.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
I also met the intelligence services.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
They asked questions about the kidnappers.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
It was logical.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I was not embarrassed.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
How do you respond today to the release of four hostages of Niger?
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I listen to what is said.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
The debate on the ransom.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Some things annoy me, others less so.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
I am trying to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as chairman of the association "hostages of the world" that allows me to put the distance, and seems much more interesting to discuss.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
I wonder, for example, on the definition of resilience.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Above all, I am fighting, with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I think there is a problem of semantics.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
It should be called the hostage-taking of hostage-taking "policy" - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
</seg>
<seg id="65">
A court in The Hague is made for that.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Why do we say to the kidnappers ' you have violated the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice? "
</seg>
<seg id="67">
It seems to me yet based, legitimate, struck in the right direction.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This message is heard but not listened to, and I am offended.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
That is my main battle.

At La Seyne, relocation for rats turns controversy
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Earlier this week, a family left her apartment in the ground floor of the building Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of the Lands Office South Habitat, has proposed, exceptional and temporary manner, to relocate the couple and their three children in a nine T4.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joel Canapa, the director of the Office.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Rats, there has always been in cities.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The company deratting achieves two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of inhabitants.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
We have done, since the end of last winter, 64 interventions.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats not swarming in the city.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, the deratification products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.

"We have not invited rats among us," defends the father who left his home to the hotel.

Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal structure of hiving ("bad bank") with 38 billion pounds (45 billion) for the most risky assets, a measure intended to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.

The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of dubious assets on its balance sheet in the next two years and hope to have cleaned it altogether within three years.

RBS also said that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional bad debts of four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, related to the establishment of the structure of cantonment.

George Kerevan: the collapse of Europe gives Scots the choice
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Another day, another worrying history of independence.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement for EU membership.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
While it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not yet in the headlines (and predictably).
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Nor has said that the EU Member States spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules whenever it suits them.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the moment, a continuous non-compliance would be a slight concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything that it wants Scots.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is a story that is not one.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And if an ancient history that it is now fixed: I have heard for the first time the hoax saying "independence means passport control" there are more than 40 years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Yet, it was forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Why an independent Scotland should follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Why share the yoke of London against Brussels, especially now?
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Here is the real news on Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely stalled.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and come from nowhere, attracted nearly five million votes in the federal election in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits ‚Äì this was only true for Greece.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The European system has rather places on its members of favourable exchange rates to German exporters ‚Äì what the German politicians want to keep.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-√†-vis Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending ‚Äì encouraged by Berlin.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Following the energy "green" policies imposed by Brussels ‚Äì which are a reason to subsidize the French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer ‚Äì European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It is a fatal drawback in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a shale gas cheap American.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Consequently, the cause, particularly in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
After the war, the French political elite has regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But Berlin has no need of Paris as passport policy legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined scramble.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The result: the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Front anti-European, has just won a crucial by-election, leaving the Socialists to power in the third place.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote ‚Äì a timely warning for the British Labour Party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically left.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
What is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity among the white working-class French?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could monitor the European Parliament for the first time.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European sentiment and anti-single currency in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The EU will not disappear, but it will be up to something more like "a Europe of Nations (sovereign)" free preferred by General de Gaulle.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Germany and some of its satellites economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I expect that the UK distancing to this project, and I hope he will be cuddling up to the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left out in the Atlantic.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
And Scotland, in all this?
</seg>
<seg id="42">
We can decide to be a region of the small England (essentially).
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes to brush off Berlin and Brussels.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
I believe that Scotland could tolerate a freer European agreement provided that we bear our own currency.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a Europe of Nations not federal.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and retain our economic independence.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The SNP government in Scotland is ‚Äì and it should be noted ‚Äì the anti-austerity political movement that has been most successful in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the proposed cutbacks (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, Labour and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was botched, supports a lawyer

<seg id="2">
After police confirmed that they have put their hands on a copy of the video showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation as "botched."
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Ruby suggested me to The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
On Thursday, police arrested the friend and occasional driver Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35, and has been accused of extortion on the video.

Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.

Ruby me called "inexplicable" the police never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his home, or bugged his telephone, arguing that the Police Chief Bill Blair has chosen knowingly not to act against the mayor.

Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions by hand, might well have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford, the mayor, stop and search - even without a warrant.

A house explosion in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette at a gas leak.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The explosion of a home in Gesves, who made two serious injured Friday morning, a grandmother of 52 years, and his grandson of 5 years, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday night the substitute of the crown prosecutor.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The expert sent by the Public Prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The grandmother has lit a cigarette when there was a leak and an accumulation of gas.

The threatening of the two victims is always engaged.

A black box in your car?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
While the planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find money to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that binds above the dashboard of your car.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The devices, which record all miles flown by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing of the major American roads.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The largely meaningless planning thrusts suddenly provoked a spirited debate and hectic alliances.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you browse, and possibly the road on which you drive, then use the information to write a draft tax bill.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Tea Party is appalled.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expressed concern about the protection of privacy.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They are looking how, over the next decade, they can move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a system of GPS monitoring for an experimental jaunt.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is really essential for our nation.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It is not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state is beginning to register the miles flown by each California motorist by 2025.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The technology is there to do so.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump is dry financially.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a specialist transport policies at the University of Minnesota.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
His state has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a payment system in the mile.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Wonks call that user fees in mileage.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
It is not surprising that the idea makes the urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Planners of California are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state law on global warming.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said he regarded as the most viable alternative to the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers to the mile.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"It is not simply a tax entering a huge black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
People pay more directly to the benefits that are provided.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The movement is also supported by two former US secretaries of Transportation, in a report in 2011, urged Congress to move in the direction of the payment to the mile.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The US Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that would have covered about 10000 cars.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
But the chair of the House killed the proposal, responding to concerns from lawmakers representing rural voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or in town.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Several states and cities are nevertheless progress on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5000 drivers to conduct the most important experience of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
These motorists soon pay the State fee milepost in lieu of taxes on gasoline.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The New York City is considering one.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The coalition and I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The concept is not a universal success.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In Nevada, where about 50 motorists volunteers have recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were worried that the government can track their movements.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"Concerns about Big Brother and these things are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
It is not something that people want.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "it would be relatively easy to convert these devices into locator devices."
</seg>
<seg id="45">
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep the recordings of the daily comings and goings of people.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Nevada is one of the few states that are struggling now to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles travelled a car, but without knowing the place nor the exact hour.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
If we can do it, " said Khan, citizens will be more comfortable.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California named True Mileage.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Originally, the company is not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
It sought to break into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers pay according to their mileage.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But the devices it tested liked planners of major highways because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
"People will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and did not locate," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Big mistakes were made in the pilot programs in some states.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
There are ways far cheaper and less intrusive methods.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In Oregon, planners are experimenting by offering motorists different choices.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
They can still choose not to have a device at all, choosing instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles flown by all residents of the state.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Other states are hoping to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
In the city of New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a system of taxation which would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance payment to the "conduct" and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
However, some transportation planners wonder whether the whole debate on the payment to the mile is not simply a huge diversion.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the area of the San Francisco Bay, officials say that Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when it was simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs with the committee.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
If you do that, hundreds of millions of motorists would be concerned for the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.

The British police issued a warrant for extradition against Assange

The British police have now issued a warrant for extradition against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who fled to the embassy of Ecuador in London and has requested political asylum.

Scotland Yard said it had issued a "notice of surrender" against the Australian of 40 years, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not, it would be likely to be arrested.

The NSA involves an "internal error" and not hackers for the outage of its site
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the outage of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during an update planned," said the spy agency in a statement by email.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The problem will be resolved this evening.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The allegations that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] are false.

<seg id="6">
Earlier this evening, the servers online trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.

Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the internal network of the agency was " not at all compromise.

You crave a neon ice?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A British entrepreneur has created the world's largest ice cream made from fluorescent jellyfish.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate chemically the brilliant protein.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it sparkle.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Chris explained that, since the cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you licks, shinier it becomes.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Charlie, the founder of the company "lick ice Me I am Delicious," said: "it is something amazing, but we are still in the early days in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about ¬£ 200."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The protein that we use in ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
So when your mouth warms the protein, pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
We have tested in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all when Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is probably the most expensive ice that I created because the jellyfish luminescence worth four times more expensive than gold.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Every ball I therefore costs about ¬£ 140.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But she is rather good taste!
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The company's experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But his next creation looks even more ambitious.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It is inherently impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.

Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence services, said he was prepared to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The German MEP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In a letter that was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, the truth is not a crime.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the context of the complaint filed by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of government property.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Hans-Peter Friedrich, interior minister, told the German Zeit Online: "if Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make this possible."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA had bugged the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without endangering and completely ruin relations with the United States," he had to take advantage of it.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Mr. Str√∂bele, German Green MEP, has published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mr. Str√∂bele said that, according to the lawyer of former NSA, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if it left the country.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, it should be given the assurance that it would be " safe " there, " said MP.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a campaign of persecution "serious and sustained" that had forced him to leave his country.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The citizens of the world, as well as senior officials ‚Äì including the United States ‚Äì have ruled that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."

A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the coast of northern Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Centre for Conservation and Animal Science Association and Marins Environments (OCEAMM) for L 'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you surprised?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
If in the past, the species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomical and geographic base, today, the development of new tools such as genetics, we can improve our science knowledge of the classification of species.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species within the genus, family, or even an order.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphological ranked animals, on the basis of morphological differences between the species.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Today, some of these rankings are challenged because of advances in genetics.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Similarly, two very close morphologically species were distinguished by genetics.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This is the case of the new species has been identified.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
There is a dozen years, the scientific community recognized two species in the subfamily: the humpback dolphin Pacific and humpback whales in the Atlantic.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Recent analysis has identified four species.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Why is this an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
</seg>
<seg id="14">
From a conservation perspective, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present there.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of existing individuals on Earth, that is to say the stock, and the possibility that she has to recover from the neighbouring stocks.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered, its stock is automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It prefers to send robots to Mars, to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 miles from the surface of the sea.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets in marine research and it is high time for change.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The mining magnate, who is contesting the payment of a carbon tax in an amount of $6 million, argued that argument to try to fend off questions about a possible conflict.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes must be removed.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott's daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"It will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtain or not leave," Mr Palmer said.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after a recount.

Mr Palmer has put forward the idea of an overhaul of the system of body votes to speed up the process.

<seg id="12">
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, seize your details into a computer, vote immediately and the result at 6: 30 the next morning?
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pens to mark paper ballots.

When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to compete for and win the trophy for the Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be fierce.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
But nobody expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Not yet in school and only a few months after his first, the toddler and his Shetland pony Toffee have been during the three rounds with great ease and won the top prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The two inseparable ‚Äì which are the same size ‚Äì have been hailed for the presentation, the attitude and style at the annual competition held at the riding centre Sunnybank, Rudry near Cardiff.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Running against men and women in elegant bowler hats, he wore his cap a little flat on the side of laidback manner to scroll through his Toffee 2-year-old pony around the track.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Fenton was praised by judges for its natural qualities of dressage uncommon for a child of his age.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And Toffee received high marks for his presentation and his personality.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third anniversary in March and has since led with his Shetland pony every day.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duet."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They went against all but the two have raided Gold Cup and the rosette.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It was only the second time he heightened with Toffee and we were thrilled that he has won.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On the runway, people who knew him thought it was so dramatic that they wanted to be photographed with him.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Mrs Howells said: "there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He walked the entire length of the runway and although he seemed to be very small, he has done a wonderful job.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Fenton is crazy animals ‚Äì he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and two chickens.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
How it started, it will surely soon to the manifestation of the Horse of the Year ‚Äì and I am sure he will make a good performance.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton was only 3 years, but he knows how to lead his pony."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They are a good team.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were and how they marched on the runway.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer ‚Äì Fenton and Toffee were the best on the runway.

The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson has ensured that before their release, members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
All wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, " he said.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - which do not meet the "universality of service" of the army demanding that staff are able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to achieve the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In particular, they cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including a soldier released last Friday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Cpl. David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, reached the post-traumatic stress syndrome, has been released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed towards the exit before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with the plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different that leaving the ranks.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I told them that I was not ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army is struggling to determine how it can grant latitude to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit to fight.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Under current rules, the injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Data presented last year in Parliament show that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required for pension benefits.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Liberal critic veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the NDP Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."

The benefit of Bombardier in decline, while shipments and aircraft orders are shrinking
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a fall of 15% of its net profit Thursday, under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its division Trains.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has not provided flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft nor information on whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable commercial service before next September.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the inaugural flight test plane about a month and a half, it was stolen three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The results have not lived up to forecasts and stock prices fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its rating Thursday from "outperformance" to "performance" because of the low potential growth in the stock market over the next quarter or the next two quarters.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to clients.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test programme progresses.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest so far to $177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the assertions of society regarding energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Currently, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Pierre Beaudoin, president and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the commissioning of the first commercial plane.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media Thursday that the program progressed according to schedule.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The test is not stayed on the ground longer than expected," Mr. Beaudoin told a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the downtime of the plane.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Each manufacturer plans differently.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
We had decided to proceed with a first flight with a period of updated, and that is what we have done.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It will be repeated throughout the flight programme.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The second of the five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks, others will follow shortly after, said the company.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client to fly a plane CSeries only 12 months after its maiden flight.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Bombardier said that it was assessing the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"This slow flight tests ‚Äì although it is apparently in line with the internal timetable of Bombardier ‚Äì reinforces our view that the entry into service will be extended in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerksen.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In the third quarter ended September 30, the net benefit of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
EPS adjusted remained unchanged at 9 cents.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Revenue fell slightly to 4.2 to $4.1 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Analysts were expecting an outcome of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world has indicated that he had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Net orders fell to 26 planes, against 83 before.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The delay in the Aerospace division accounted for 32.9 billion to $30, a figure unchanged from September to December 31 of the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"In Aerospace, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions have been disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The incomes of Aeronautics dropped 13% to reach $2 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Bombardier, the world's largest rail builder, said that revenue from this division had increased by nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The backlog of transportation division totaled 32.6 billion at 30 September, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The margins of the Transport Division suffered problems on a few big contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The leaders announced that new evidence would be provided in the fourth quarter.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The share prices of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, sit on the board, has fallen by 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon on Thursday.

The Kenyan press is unworthy of the controversial media law
</seg>
<seg id="2">
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament to sweep the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?," said the newspaper questioning the bill and asking what it is unconstitutional.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"This law is draconian and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group ‚Äì owner of CapitalFM, one of the radio stations and Internet sites of the most respected independent news in Kenya.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on the content and advertising would affect Kenya's place in the global economy.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and send the parliamentarians," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "a stranglehold on the media." The Standard has indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suffered a hard blow" and criticised the bill as "draconian."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time that a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the commercial centre of Westgate last September.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting images of CCTV cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly shied away from the shopping mall.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The head of the police, David Kimaiyo, has responded by calling two journalists and a media manager for the interview, although the invitation was withdrawn after an outcry in the media.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Under the new bill, the media can be punished with fines of up to 20 million shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "separated" or not being able to receive accreditation official press.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if it has not paid his fine.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
By reducing the media into silence, politicians know they can do what they want with impunity.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"Nobody will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist for The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a source of key control in public life.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and push us to hunting and gathering."

An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches its suburban Party
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Let us not fool ourselves.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "party of the suburbs" is not only to commuters.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
I chose a map of France as its logo, justifies it.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
When I talk about the suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the national family.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his home commune of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, that great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
My proposal n ¬∞ 1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, he says.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years, attached territorial claims today as apolitical "100%" even if it has not always been neutral.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chev√©nement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right people are willing to support me, I will also listen, " he says.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
There is only the extremist parties that I am not talking about.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program on the Internet ‚Äì from many themes expected to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially for young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years, the rehabilitation of the caretaker...
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene " for the municipal elections in 2014, it would be fair, " he says. "
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is a problem of time and money.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Party of the suburb should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Abdel-Malik Djermoune is already have seven heads list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"And the support that I receive emails since yesterday is not all suburban" he says.

Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa might have to pass a test of "authenticity"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The government is currently studying the possibility of setting up a test of "authenticity" for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while he intends to extend the crackdown.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The test, if it is adopted, would be applied on a test intended to prevent 457 visas to be used to fill unskilled positions or as a roundabout way to bring his family and friends in Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A government discussion paper was unveiled today as the Labor MP Maxine McKew denounced the government rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that it might offend the neighbours of Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"The sensational declarations on" foreigners returning at the end of the queue "and" jobs for Australians first "are an unpleasant return to a time when unions demanded a protected market," she told the Australia India Institute today.

Companies could also be required to report the number of holders of 457 visas after some of them, having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers actually employed hundreds.

Challenging the right to abortion in Texas
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A federal appeals court has restored Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that state and widely questioning the right to abortion is going to come into force.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The judgment by the Court of Appeal means that physicians attending the IVG will require a "privilege" of admission to local hospitals.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The privilege of admission is the right to a doctor under membership hospital, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Advocates of abortion contend that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain the privilege of admission " for their practitioners.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In total, it would be nearly 22000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
On Monday, a judge of first instance had found on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But the Attorney General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who ran for governor, has asked the appellate court to cancel the trial judgment blocking the application of the law.
</seg>
<seg id="10">

It has been five years since my father was erased from the world of the living.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
At the beginning I have denied his death, I spoke to him at present,
</seg>
<seg id="3">
I was so afraid to forget or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to "attend".
</seg>
<seg id="4">
There is no recipe for moving the wall of the invisible and regain its own.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Then, signs have emerged.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I drove.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more on the nightstand.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is the image of my father smiled with me in my everyday gestures.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Our mother died after his exhausting struggle against cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
At least that is what I thought when I found her body becomes void on the hospital bed to the crumpled sheets.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Similarly, her funeral was a frigid farewell focused around the meagre light candles that framed his coffin.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
I thought it was a party.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Slowly, by small diurnal and nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned in my mind, as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking are believed in mourning.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And then, it was while showing me my own facets that I had not yet seen, masked by my relationship with her.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
So I have learned and understood that I had no lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I did not really know, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in life.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In dying, this woman had perfect his life and the person that I loved, and here I was, the full.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This detour from the path of my life is the most unexpected and most beautiful.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I like my father, "as the inside out" apparently.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
I have always said.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I never thought at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
I have had difficult relations with him until he becomes old, ill.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Here, I have been afraid of him and I love it.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
One day, he died.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit, when I had fear, when I had bad...
</seg>
<seg id="26">
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
I saw his hands looking at mine, I paid him my body.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
But it was never indiscreet.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
I could have a personal life.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
I left my privacy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It lasted a long time and then one day he is gone.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I do not know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
My parents are no longer but I constantly feel about me.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer: what would you have said that they would have thought that they would have done?
</seg>
<seg id="36">
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
I often dream of last moments that I must share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this time.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
I wake up often anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Sometimes I have dreams instead and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and to share my life.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I hissais out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the level and I smiled and exulted that I expected a little boy.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep indicating to me that he shared with joy this was happening.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
And, of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
I liked to share this moment with him and I am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
There are precisely five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A year ago, she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
That is the shock that her disappearance resulted in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Despite everything I have achieved my mourning quickly enough.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to take important decisions.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Learn Arabic and my interest in the Middle East, making for a master's degree in high school, were not, with hindsight, innocuous choice.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
In fact, I often heard Arabic in my childhood, and talk of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at independence.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
The values she instilled me are always present, so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and goodness of spirit that was a fervent believer.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, an uplifting spirit.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
I see his eyes alight on me.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
My mother died there are nineteen years now.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Dead after having spoken to me on the telephone.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, the tears that go off alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Then, time has eased the pain.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
It remained that lack this empty unanswered, this need for it, to assign me, reassure me in the palm of his sweetness.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Yet it is here, silent presence, it is there and look at me.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Every morning, I see his eyes worried landing on me, I see rings that encumber her eyes, wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, folds that mark the front days of concern.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
My mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
And every morning I distracts the eye.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
There is a continuous protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then it has gradually regain smile, and his name is no longer taboo, but a comfort.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Of course, I speak to him in the palm of the night when the absence is too bad, she is invited onto my dreams when morale is a little achieved.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
We feel encouraged and protected in difficult times, in retrospect we realize how important it was conductor and we are trying to remain in the way that it had drawn us.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
If you enjoyed very strong, the absence cannot be removed from the heart and souvenirs.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
In some ways, the beloved becomes your inner energy.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
I was very close to him, I have always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
I was not able to attend her burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a boy.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
If I have my beliefs sometimes different, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with its vision of things.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what it thinks.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
I do not know if I adopted its way or if I am just like him: is it genetic?
</seg>
<seg id="78">
In any case, it will always be my reference.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk among ourselves.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
In short, it is here on a daily basis.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
I feel his presence, and it makes me happy.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
That is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33 years.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years.
</seg>

The immense which then invaded has of course dampened but it is always close to me.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
Very often it "landed" in my dreams so precise, so alive that I am even sadder awakening to find that it was only a dream.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, I say "I descend" but a voice so real that I woke up in bed and anxious and I turned on the bedlight looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to happen.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
I still live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I returned to see if he is not here, I know it is him and I talk to him.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
In all the parts I feel his presence, and it makes me happy.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
Nothing in the world I would quit this house where we were happy, or his spirit lives with me.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
I would like to say that I am sociable with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and I sang, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul and I never speak to him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

Collision between Palestinians and Israelis at the border of Gaza
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday 31 October 2013 at the evening in a violent collision at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased to function on Friday 1 November after a depletion of stocks of fuel, announced the Energy Authority in the Palestinian enclave.

<seg id="4">
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another part of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a barrage of tank shells at an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to local medical sources.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Two other local officials of Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, died when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Their bodies were discovered later.

<seg id="14">
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," warned the spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
For its part, the Israeli army said that the target of the operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities".
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying that the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The operation was to prevent future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, explained an Israeli military communique.
</seg>

Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, containing information of Radio Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago of (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is the UK since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, episode in the history of the English navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A few dozen people, most of them descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still inhabit Pitcairn and their incomes depend on 95% of the generosity of London.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Island Council has voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to make these 836000 km2, provided, however, have the means to ensure the monitoring, which is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where placing military surveillance vessels.

The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found in a carpet of fight rolled in the gymnasium of the high school, believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the bleachers in the gymnasium of the high school.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Investigators from the Sheriff of the Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the boy 17 years of disputes these conclusions.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
They have never thought it was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"They think it defies any logic, the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered with the sole aim to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"They have sent their son to school with a binder, and it has made in a body bag," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The United States Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
What is the cause of death?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
His death is the result of a criminal act?
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Moore was speaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I will follow the facts wherever they lead.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
My goal is to discover the truth.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a formal investigation, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxiation".
</seg>
<seg id="18">
However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"Several issues still deserve a response or confirmation," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to conduct.

The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
</seg>
<seg id="2">
M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without never regains its track, has in fact been buried in a mass grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of the German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel in Bild.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
M√ºller has not survived the end of the war.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the mass circulation daily based on archival documents.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would meet one of the great riddles of the After-War.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The German secret service, the BND, and were in the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The secret services is totally wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"In August 1945, the body of M√ºller was found in a temporary tomb near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando," according to Mr. Tuchel.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He wore "a general's uniform."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"In the left inner pocket included his service with a photograph," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Bild also publishes a document's municipal district of Mitte district in Berlin that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.

Egypt asks the first freely elected president sworn in
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Mohamed Morsi swore the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflict in Egypt.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he swore the oath of presidential nomination, becoming the first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
At his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state to Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He was sworn in front of the 18 judges in black robes of the Court that the building located on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life ‚Äî absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," explained Mr Morsi, an engineer from 60 years formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the Court to cheer the new president, and the presidential splendour of the Mubarak years, traffic has been interrupted only briefly to allow the passage of his convoy in busy streets linking downtown to the southern suburbs.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Regarded as the "spare tire" uncharismatic of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has risen considerably since his victory and his speech Friday in which he has tried to portray himself as the candidate not only Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Hosni Mubarak.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room with woodwork where he was sworn in.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Later, Mr Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he gave his inauguration speech.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem when he went to attention.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the chant "the people and the army, hand in hand..." intoned by thousands of people gathered in the main hall of the university.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Mr Morsi has made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where is the party uprising that ended the authoritarian Mubarak regime last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, was dispossessed.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But by agreeing to formally take the oath before the Court, rather than before parliament as is customary, bowing to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The speech by Mr Morsi in Tahrir Square was accompanied by populist dramatic gestures.

Aircraft manufacturers squabble about the width of seats while big orders are at stake
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The dispute is raging between the large aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow, which takes place in month.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-haul flights in economy class passengers ‚Äì which are not always the most courted by the airlines, but the space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This week, Airbus has called on the aviation industry to implement a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great US rival Boeing said that it should be up to airlines to decide.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The dispute erupted when manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their long-haul aircraft twins, hoping eventually a record orders at the event which will take place from 17 to 21 November.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
How the seats will be willing to the back of the plane ‚Äì in particular, have 9 or 10 seats in front ‚Äì is essential to the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo segment."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Boeing says its "777X" redeveloped will accommodate in economy class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Airbus says that the version of its competing A350 will transport economy class 350 people in seats from 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The aviation giants often exchanging blows on technical issues by advertising in the press.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It has been spotlighted recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in a restaurant, "do you accept it?"
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
As dietary habits change, people grow, but the seats on planes have not changed radically.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Between the early 1970s, when the jumbo Boeing 747 has defined the long-haul trip, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The size of the average American in the 21 century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. statistics.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Airbus says that his rival clings to a concept of seat that dates to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly christened "jet set" was closer.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Airbus says that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional boost to the width of seats would improve sleep quality by 53%.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Boeing disputed Airbus's figures regarding the width of seats and says that it is not manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance the ticket prices and equipment.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience depends not only on the width of the seats.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"It is really provide flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction among Boeing.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
They do not want to be told what they will be profitable.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
They know their business better than anyone.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For passengers, it is more of a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an amount estimated at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of American and European exports.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As Reuters noted for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Airbus and Boeing both claim a return by seat in their latest models of long-haul twin 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The performance announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Boeing made it to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Passenger Comfort in Airbus.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers were in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the proposal of Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the expert in cabin interiors Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Sellers of planes that go around the world prevail even with a metre to verify the competing configurations.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
While extolling a comfortable, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for greater customization cabins by offering wider aisle seats on some of its planes.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry in order to establish a standard for the seats to succeed, but that it could overshadow the wave of sales of 777X.

After Broadway and London, Paris finally found his voice.
</seg>

It is a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a kind of success.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Long, Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart opera rock, most attempts to emp√™traient ridiculous.

<seg id="6">
And the successes such as Cabaret or Les Mis√©rables wore the aura of mystery.

How the French are changing musical comedies?
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The offer is increased.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
First there are the "music" that do evolve as producers...
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Some use projections -beautiful images and a true story - as in 1789, the Amants de la Bastille.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Others made a leap of 15 years on the grounds that we can serve almost -anything when Matt -Pokora in headliner.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
After, it was musicals with the sumptuous productions du Ch√¢telet -that we bring the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.

The French -independent producers seek a breakthrough.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But ongoing projects such as "rent,"  "the Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "spring Awakening" - to be financed.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Do we have enough artists as able to Broadway singer, play and dance?
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it is a great year.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
We have 200 talented artists turning projects into projects.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The United States, birthplace of the musical, it is very different.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Jobs are plentiful among the regional theatres, touring Broadway, off-Broadway...
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The talent pool is also a result that the number of vacancies.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Why touring in the province have so much success?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Few plays touring and is often theatre boulevard - for adults and not for young adults.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The music fills the -lack.

Ben Greenman: tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: the New Yorker
</seg>
<seg id="2">
You could say that New York City is the place where the stand-up in America: there are almost 100 years, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Innovation Fay persisted over the years, to be repeated more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand-up Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and major theatres.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"Most of the headliners have emerged in the Carolinas, and have been a great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We created the festival in order to be able to continue to work with them.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "stand Up for Heroes," an evening of comedy and music for the benefit of veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The festival has grown, just as the world of comedy.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Several actors participating in the festival this year went through non-traditional channels, presenting such performances on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("the League" on the theme of cheerfully lascivious fantasy football chain FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Jenny Slate participated in the program "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation," but it is still best known for his series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors in the singular voice (the pessimistic surreal Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate for racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
One of the main attraction of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a director of accomplished film and TV, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The appointment takes place at the Guildhall in central Manhattan.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The city is definitely in the DNA of comic all the work of Larry," said Steinberg.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He told me that when he was here, sometimes it descended an alley between two buildings and said Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I will live here.

Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
</seg>
<seg id="2">
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation systems and electric rails, was discovered.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The US authorities have described the tunnel by 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had ever seen.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The tunnel, zigzagging on a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which can easily conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The tunnel was closed before the drugs are revealed in passing unnoticed, said the authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to court records.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They incur a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.

Syria has destroyed its production capacity of chemical weapons, says the oversight body
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, said the international body monitoring chemical weapons Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline of
</seg>
<seg id="5">
November 1, set by the organization based in The Hague ordering in Damascus to destroy or render unusable " all units of production of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing the toxic gas and ammunition.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is believed that the country has about 1000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The announcement was made while the fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which, according to experts, is home to a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights based in Britain.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120296 people had died.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61067 civilians, including 6365 children.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On the government side, it is estimated that 29954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad died, including 18678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2202 were deserters and some 5375 of opposition fighters, many of which were foreigners.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
25 July, the UN has estimated that 100000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It has not updated that figure since.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The troops of al-Assad are fighting against the rebels, many of which are linked to groups of Al-Qaeda network, Safira for weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no detail.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons while they must complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war, which continues under tight deadlines.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
A statement of the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, indicated that his team was "now satisfied to have controlled ‚Äì and destroyed ‚Äì all production declared critical and machinery for mixing and filling."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the moment."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
They have not been able to visit the two sites because of concerns about their safety, said the inspectors.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program that they contained had been moved to other sites, which have been inspected."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It was difficult to know at a glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors have not been able to visit.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"I welcome the moral strength and the courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Two employees of the YMCA NSW have been accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission in charge of sexual abuse of children.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said he "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor for the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, senior counsel with the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was incorrect stressing, "YMCA of external checks were completed and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It has been shown to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the worst seconds appraisals on four institutions at a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Mr Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that the management staff has been a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any breach of security policy.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He was sentenced to 6 years in prison.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But Mr. Hare has rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff to report breaches of Lord towards the safety of children.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was left alone with children, that he kept them in private, was sitting on his lap, said that he liked them and left them playing with his mobile phone.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had sought training in child protection because it was concerned about his behaviour, said that it was responsible for the child of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which covered Lord "very daunting and difficult to reach most of the time."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The CEO said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these violations to their supervisor.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have scrambled their judgment, so that they have not reported his actions.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Mr Hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA NSW saying that, for the organization, the lesson of "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not be "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Mr Hare said that the decision to sign the staff confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations have been raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA for children's services, Liam Whitley.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that she had been poorly implemented.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time that Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, testing, orientation, training and supervision of staff.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.

A ceremony in memory of the dead cr√©matis√©s

<seg id="5">
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos survey conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For the funeral of a close, it is the opposite: the French prefer interment (53% vs. 47%).
</seg>
<seg id="7">
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In his book The Death ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the Ethics Committee of the National Funeral, insists on the "violence" that cremation is, for the survivors.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is, with cremation, "a violence liked the body," which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the stages of grief."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There is also a "symbolic violence", which is "the erasure of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ash.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Why should what is accepted in some Nordic countries and Protestants, it is still resented in France?
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, president of the Society of thanatologie and author of the book Taming the death.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Taming cremation, it is for Fran√ßois Michaud-N√©rard, Director General of the funeral services of the City of Paris, a ceremony for the deceased as worthy as that to which he would be entitled to burial.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The annual Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Now, 73% of those who chose cremation to the organisation of a ceremony.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
66% atheists or non-believers want it too.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Crematoria have adapted to the evolution of society.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"For a decade, they are trying to avoid the violence of a families waiting, without doing anything for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the presentation of the ashes," observes Mr Michaud-N√©rard.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
70% of institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who, in the presence of the body, the ritual: hosting the meeting, appoint the decedent, connect to others, the raise, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This is the case in P√®re Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The masters of ceremony are often people who have switched.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
There is also former Catholic priests.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is in this context that the Lachaise crematorium has since 2010, the day of The Toussaint, ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, which it calls on the families of those who have been cr√©matis√©es in the year.
</seg>

Hagel accuses 9 US states to violate homosexuals rights
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the Defense Department and the benefits that come with," said the Minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"But some states refuse to issue the cards to same-sex couples in the facilities of the National Guard" established on their territory, he denounced, criticising these states to violate the federal law and the principle of equality.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many health or social services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.

On the carpet, also white, in the vast space is the Th√©√¢tre Maisonneuve, juts profile, like a line and clad in black, a body.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
On the screen, a Henri Michaux ink is projected.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The body, stroke, takes its form.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And this form will be that of the entire room: a string of physical imitations of drawings.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The dancers, dressed entirely in black, only the hands and face uncovered, expect each side of the playground, rush when the next spelling appears, embody, stand out.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is relay solos, group in unison (a mass that makes solo), large group of twelve solos where everyone performs his sign.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
We think of morning glory, where solo, Chouinard conducted a series of choreographic assignments written on cartels, posed online to the fore.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is the same principle, giant version PowerPoint.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Energy is high, always the rapid pace.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
There will be breakage when Carol Prieur remaining under the carpet to dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety and restraint, a part of the poem by Michaux, monotonous and dull in the auction, and continue dancing.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And the music again, and the sequence to resume.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This sound discharge and energetic, long, if possible, eventually assourdir and numb.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
There are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - as these hair who √©bouriffent or black fabrics that prolong the lines.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
But the approach is choreographic composition.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux, emerged with its tics.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The result: the bodies appear to be flat in the drawings.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Inks Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open a broader and starvation that imaginary dance, more porous.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Only the late, negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre is the magic.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The public has liked, the reception was warm.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The Gymnop√©dies, after intermission, is richer.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The scene is partly draped gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in an abandoned house.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The piano, dancers have rallied together to play the partitions.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Their awkwardness in music, poignant, give a real fragility.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
On stage, couples spend romantic duets, very sensual, even erotic.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Group work, small solo transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Fools are appearing, as familiar to Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in amorous displays very polarized gender.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The lovers are carnivores, evasion or players.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The gesture, laughter and small cries transpose the beautifully archaic, grace and ridicule of coitus, beings who are based.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But the piece takes its impetus from real salvation.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
A clown is on the scene when the public leaves.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
There, everything becomes permit: the fourth wall falls, the universe explored overlap, dancers cabotinent, down among the spectators, pontificate here, smoke, bypass, play codes of applause, stretches the sauce in a cleverly calculated mess that is sensual.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, contaminating the public.

Report: the Obama campaign considered dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have envisaged in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to the New York Times.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "double Down: game Change 2012."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published Thursday evening and told that the entourage of the president had conducted "extensive work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama in his re-election while his hopes have dwindled.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the ballot.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the campaign HQ in Chicago and inside the Oval Office.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Only a half-dozen close aides of the president ‚Äì including Daley, the former head of Obama's campaign, Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe ‚Äì knew that change was in the study.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"Double Down" indicates that Daley has led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not improve significantly the chances of success for Obama."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden by Clinton.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"I said that I had examined a whole series of issues, and it was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Remember that at that time, the president was not in form, and therefore we said, ' Lord, what can we do? "
</seg>
<seg id="12">
While Daley called the review of "concerted," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover if the change would benefit at the polls.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"The campaigns do not spend a lot of money to polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action," said Martin on AC360.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
However, it is unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the potential realignment.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Although Daley has said he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" Obama knew.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Martin added that "double Down" did not definitively on the question of whether political pollsters had arrived on the Obama office.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden's presidential list was being considered.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"Maybe," said Martin.

David Bowie: four unreleased in listening
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The English musician has not finished a surprise this year.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
From The Next Day, published in January, he has concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Four have already emerged on the Web.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone stunned.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
On the day of his 66th birthday, 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, 2003) and too rare appearances in public, the English musician proved that it could still count on him to make the glittering pop scene.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A feast for fans
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Not weary surprises, David Bowie had more than a trick in his bag with The Next Day.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Thin White Duke has planned to republish this album, on 4 November.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For the occasion, he has concocted a feast for his fans.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will take the form of three discs: the original album of unreleased studio sessions and remixes and a DVD containing the four clips already disclosed.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles from the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
David Bowie has made submissions of this beautiful box into a video.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He introduced both each disk, but also provided with accessories: exclusive photos and a pocket notebook to share his impressions, a booklet with the words...
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And, above all, it gives a foretaste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a cleverly controlled power rock.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Already listening unpublished
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But Atomica is not the only way to reveal its charms.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The Inform, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Inform is double-face: a worrying intro before a luminous cavalcade that slows gradually to give way to a pop ballad.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie he wanted to make a brief reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
With this cheery title, the singer seems to be in his element when he no longer has the feet on the ground.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Space Oddity, alongside, was much more serious.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie is once again referred to his strangeness: come from another planet?
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The guitar riffs, entrancing, a desire to leave Earth.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: in turn informer, a man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It conceals and reveals both plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including his characters Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
No wonder he has therefore a mask in hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, brand Louis Vuitton, he embodies the new face.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.

<seg id="2">
A bird, later hoisted after he was found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in the wild.

It boosted the groan of water aboard a helicopter in Aberdeen last month before it is released by the Scottish SPCA in his rescue centre of Alloa.
</seg>

The centre's director, Colin Seddon said: "this death rattle of water was probably a migratory wintering who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of winds in the North Sea."

It appears that the exhausted birds would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He added: "he was unable to fly again, so we have been contacted for help."

<seg id="7">
The groan of water was healthy when he was released.

Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive television
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Subscribers of Cogeco Cable may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video-on-demand service Netflix via their television in a future that does not seem so distant.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The subsidiary of Cogeco said Thursday that it was currently preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," said President and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Cogeco Cable is following its competitors, such as Bell, even though the subsidiary Cogeco does not yet have a precise date in relation to this new platform.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"We must adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been named, could be resolved.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The United States, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne, on 16 October.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Ottawa wants to force providers of cable television and satellite to offer customers the ability to pay for services to the card.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It is almost two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large bundles of channels, it does not work," Mr. Audet said.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"It will emerge from these discussions, a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy in regard to television," said the CEO of Cogeco.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The CRTC is conducting consultations with the public since the last week and they should continue with industry next spring.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents per share.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It is a decrease compared to net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The Montreal-based company said the decrease in depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Cogeco acquired the cable in 2012 Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Last December, the Montreal company has also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The income of Cogeco, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
They are 1.8 billion for the fiscal year.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period last year.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The incomes of Cogeco Cable, however, rose by 45% to $470.4 million.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The company has lost 15237 customers during the fourth quarter.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is increasing 5546.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Mr. Audet is not concerned to see the number of customers fluctuate.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, " he observed.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It varies from one quarter to another with a fierce competition.

Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline of Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"A historic event took place today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the large-scale project, the largest in Europe," said Alexei Miller, the CEO of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which handles the bulk of Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes, adds the director.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The Bulgarian consumers will receive the South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project will be put into service in 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Gazprom said that the construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

The Ministry of Education tomorrow must publish its new programs of English and maths ‚Äì the first material to undergo a radical overhaul.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It will make changes in other basic materials next year.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Furthermore, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil an overhaul of the GCSE structure, with a new scoring system and fewer courses.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Education Minister, said that there was a "broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting that the GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Studies show that English schools spend less time math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In comparison, the Australian schools on average 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore are about 138 hours.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time use math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE maths deepened ‚Äì as well as the greater importance attached to matters contained in the international rankings ‚Äì probably would encourage schools to ensure more hours.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The program will put more emphasis on the "problems of the real world," including financial mathematics.

The European elite is ready to do business with Britain?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
To this end, we commissioned the investigation the broadest and most complete with British managers and asked what they thought of Britain, businesses, and the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
YouGov interviewed more than 1000 business leaders, broadly representative of all sizes of firms, sectors and regions of Britain.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We discovered that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on those countries that are modernizing and develop while EU states are stagnant.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
They want to see the government give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcana.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
When asked their opinion on specific political issues ‚Äì ranging from regulating monopolies to laws on products ‚Äì the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should return to the hands of Westminster.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The single market has caused a general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that there has to be part of the European exchanges ‚Äì 40% of big business, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agree.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Finally, and what is more telling, our survey of business leaders found that a substantial majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that restores the power in the UK.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The stakes are high ‚Äì to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a swing of 16% of the votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: the survey shows that British businesses support the plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of Britain to the EU.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It also shows that companies are hoping that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the eurozone is committed to the path of closer economic and fiscal union.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation show, for businesses that means renewed emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.

Beijing involves a Turkmen Islamic movement
</seg>
<seg id="2">
"The behind the scenes to support the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, based in West and Central Asia," said the boss of Chinese security bodies to a television channel in Hong Kong, according to a video Thursday evening on a website.

Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered the credit rating Friday of Ukraine, questioning the ability of the ex-Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The note of public debt in the country to "B-", venturing into the category of speculative investments.

It is with a negative outlook, S seeing at least one in three chance that it will again be lowered within a year.

"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy to secure sufficient foreign currency to meet its external financing needs," says the American agency.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The agency notes that foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend will continue.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It makes the repayment of credits taken abroad.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
These reserves, which the authorities have extensively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Kiev has also need cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not having paid a bill of $882 million.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of tension with its Russian neighbour, furious about the willingness of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It was made public in the aftermath of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September, its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S estimated at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
</seg>

The country, budget deficit, has been demanding for months the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted him a credit in 2010 of $15.3 billion and has released for the moment that 3.4 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has not passed unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
After another unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the large external financing needs," constituted "a vulnerability,"  "signs of economic improvement."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Policy Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term."

<seg id="17">
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms are undertaken in a pre-election year," the presidential elections in 2015, is the expert, asked AFP.

Pawnshops Singapore benefit middle-class constraints to tighten their belts
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In a pawnbroker Mall Bendemeer Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga files a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay tuition for his daughters.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money has gone into it," says Amirthalinga.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Although she earns $3000 Singapore ($2400) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, " she says.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In fact, the demand is such in parts of south-east Asia ‚Äì where household debt increases ‚Äì that ValueMax, where it conducted its transaction, this week became the third company pawn loans to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Pawning jewellery is not just a quick way to get cash ‚Äì $1300 of Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga ‚Äì but it is almost as cheap as the unsecured bank loans.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In general, pawnshops Singapore impose effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a lender with a local branch in the same mall.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Consequently, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops while families are feeling the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap credit fuelled by lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to bridge the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing household debt, resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore showed the ratio of household debt/gross domestic product, the highest in Asia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while the rate was 60% in 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which left little this week of a technical recession.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] seek to supplement their income as they can," said Song Seng Wun road, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The historically high price of gold over the last two years have proved that people were quick to pledge their personal effects to receive the cash value of their jewellery.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In Singapore, about 70% of the articles pledged in the 200 shops of pawning the city-state are in gold.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
People say, "the price of gold is high, are pawned the gold chain of grandmother and will seek the next month."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Thailand, the largest operator of boutiques of pawning, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The increase is such in pawning that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it already has four shops ‚Äì but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The company will using 60% of the $66 million in Singapore that it has removed this week when it was introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
While some lenders to reduce rates were criticised for the exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it does not directly increases the debt.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"Clients mortgage assets they already have, and monetize their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The pledge is accepted socially as a means to obtain a guaranteed short-term financing.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
People who visit pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Affluent people of Singapore are also in the boutiques of pawning ValueMax for pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
We see customers from all walks of society.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"This may be the affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs for a difficult course," added Miss Yeah.

The lawyer who is cocaine-crazed informed a godfather of the drug in a police investigation was imprisoned
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction is exposed
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the assize court in Liverpool
</seg>
<seg id="5">
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a godfather of the drug a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough concerning investigations into its activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "bash" and regarded by criminals as a "matter of primary importance," was arrested at his home in 2011 after bugging operations of police headed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, in the process of filing three bags of cocaine in the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular" consumers of the class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his portfolio and his credit cards.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth ¬£ 1.5 million, and more than ¬£ 200000 in cash in a series of raids.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is exposed.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Today, the assize court in Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell into disfavor after he was convicted on two counts of obstructing justice after a three-week trial.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The fall of the lawyer occurred after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Two investigators have followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of Ditta and placing drugs, pure to 60%, in the dustbin of the lawyer in a black glove golf.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the football stadium to Ewood Park, pregnant club Blackburn Rovers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and they are telephoned nine times.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular" consumer of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, on his portfolio and his credit cards.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the trafficker assumed because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
</seg>
<seg id="22">
During his arrest, Ditta picked its portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but they have all been seized and he was selected a sample of hair.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
During an interrogation, he said that he had an office in his home, as well as his place of work and sometimes when customers call the home to legal issues.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But the court heard testimony that he called the major players in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were informed.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "if someone needs to know that we should not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Mr Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and being too involved with particular clients.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The relationship that we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying the drug to his own lawyer.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Some of its communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was her lawyer.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But it went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It has hampered the investigation by the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Mr Ditta has not lived up to his profession, but was disgraced.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
It is too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he has left compromising its independence.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said: "if I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta grew from criminal lawyer to criminal itself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations."
</seg>
<seg id="35">
His addiction to cocaine has compromised forever and made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organised criminal groups who have instructed to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The unit responsible for the serious and organised crime in Lancashire has led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice, demonstrating its commitment to pursue the criminals to justice.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
That this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We will find you and you will translate to the courts.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
On its site, Ditta held a session of questions and answers on himself when he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate the work.

A difficult year for pharmacists
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre for health and social services (CSSS) of Laval caused quite a stir at the direction of the Hospital of the City of Health, in the year 2012-2013.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Because multiple retirements, maternity leave or any short separations, the pharmacy department was suffer a shortage of staff.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It was nearly 30% strength, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It has not been used in the shooting, Mrs Beaudet explained.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It has streamlined or decreased some of our activities within the establishment for the time that things would sort themselves out.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is certain that it has worked hard to engage our young people [residents] pharmacy to come and stay here.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is a set of circumstances that has meant that we were in a bad situation last year.
</seg>
<seg id="10">

</seg>
<seg id="11">
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and other three pharmacists were hired in recent months.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence at Laval have also decided to remain on the job of the CSSS.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Now, it is much better, said the pharmacist.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This will fill our departures last year.

<seg id="18">
However, the situation remains delicate.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 that are difficult to predict.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
For us [the numbers] is always precarious, because it was an environment that is young and it employs many young women with pregnancies, drive almost always three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Last year, there has been much more and there has been no pharmacists that are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger at the sentence against one of the Bali bombers

<seg id="2">
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence passed against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.

Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber has detonated a backpack loaded with explosives barely 20 seconds earlier.

He fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and it is "dead" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.

Mr Hughes said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage ‚Äì Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Translate by Samudra ‚Äì who were executed four years ago.

He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.

During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.

Imbroglio around the emergency closure of the H√¥tel-Dieu
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Faced with the frond conducted for several months by some of the personal and several unions, including the CGT, the health minister, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "shift the timetable for implementation of the project, and in particular the closure date of emergencies which can intervene on 4 November."
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A formal request "to not to take any risks on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but was also not to hinder the campaign of the SP in a few months.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should be effective on that date.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Even if, APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
As of November 4, firefighters ¬ñ who provided about a quarter of the 40000 annual emergency of the H√¥tel-Dieu ¬ñ will all have instructed to take the 30 serious cases per day to the other hospital emergencies in Paris.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This date of November 4 is also the renewal.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The H√¥tel-Dieu, specialized internal emergencies will leave Monday to five general internal medicine.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
With regard to the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for later this month.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"The host service emergencies of the H√¥tel-Dieu must close in the shortest time, and for us, it is on November 4," says bluntly Lo√Øc Capron, president of the Medical Committee of Establishment (CME) APHP, which supports the project management.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"On November 4, there will be more patients brought by firefighters, only from people in their own way," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new H√¥tel-Dieu.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"But we will continue to receive emergency patients," he qualifies, arguing the permanent presence of the SMUR vehicles in place to transfer the serious cases.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Emergency doctors seniors will stay, " he says.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But it is up to the LRA to decide the closure of the home emergencies.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"Things are gradually," says Nicolas P√©ju, spokesman for the LRA to which, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The Minister has lied and he lied," deplores the emergency department doctor G√©rald Kierzek.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Removed from his position as head of the SMUR early July for having conducted the frond against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "launcher" alert against a "cynical decision" by "the medico-administrative technostructure."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"They are empty and asphyxiate emergencies that have been renovated less than five years," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
For him, "if the other Parisian emergencies could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But they are regularly clogged.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for emergencies to Lariboisi√®re.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The LRA, it argued that "thirty patients" dispatched on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, including human resources have also been strengthened.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Has the LRA as APHP defends the "new model" hospital underway since 7 October and should continue to host 30000 to 35000 patients per year.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
By the end of the year, GPs Liberals should also participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"Where are we if we are asking people to self-diagnose" asked G√©rald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of not serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It is going to happen as maternity wards Level 3.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
If the Minister does not by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency department physician and member of the CGT Health.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will reflect on a list.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, an adviser to UMP in Paris and elected the 4th arrondissement, announces clearly that "even if the UMP in Paris was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H√¥tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen if it is up to the responsibilities."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, has again reminded Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
If this were the case, it would mark its net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Even if the restructuring of the H√¥tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.

Pope Francis will appoint its first cardinals in February
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Cardinals are men of church higher-ups in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect therefore Fran√ßois will appoint its first group of men who ultimately will choose his successor.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
There are currently 201 cardinals.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, as soon as a Cardinal reached the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope ‚Äì it is about a group of 120 cardinals "voters."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of a cardinal, known as the Presbytery.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate its decision to convene the Presbytery of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Jack Valero Catholic Voice said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably declined.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He said that a pope named in general as many cardinals that it took to make the number of cardinal electors reaches 120 and cardinals older than 80 years he wanted.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Presbytery of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For the moment, there is a tendency to focus on Europe and Italy in particular.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Fran√ßois formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals around the world to examine ways to reform the church.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Previously, the pope decided alone.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"Now, Fran√ßois chose the eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He added that he was "quite possible" that Francis asked council cardinals.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But we have never experienced such a situation ‚Äì it is completely new.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Valero said that popes were generally bishops represent large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises ‚Äì so we do not know who he will appoint."

G√©rard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," is dead.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
He has never known the word retirement.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Phenomenon of the French edition, G√©rard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83 years old, had just published its 200th SAS, "the Kremlin's Vengeance."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In February, the New York Times had enshrined as "the author of espionage novels who knew too much."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Then he had spent ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of 198 and 199es episode of the series of spy novels.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Physically diminished by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, it moved during this trip with a walker.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And before Afghanistan, he was also left in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
With four SAS published annually, G√©rard de Villiers, born in Paris on December 8 1929, ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul," the first of the series, there are almost half a century.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Probably between 120 and 150 million in all countries," he argued in March.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Her Burmese cat on the knees, in the lounge of his enormous apartment in a building on the Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe, the mischievous eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the SAS adventures have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"The pirate editions," he added, referring to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or reported the ivories of 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels.

Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) the prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat d√©sargent√© and contractual CIA agent to pay reparations to the family castle, launches into packages of evil on the earth, communists in the 1970s and 1980s, and jihadists from the 1990s.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of sex addict, a hint of violence and torture.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I have never had any claim to be a literary writer," explained G√©rard de Villiers.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people who I did not send a message.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He worked "as the great pre-war reporters, Albert London, who went on the spot and returned with real and lengthy investigations."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The father of SAS said "a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before," said G√©rard de Villiers.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people services that I know for certain since twenty or thirty years.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Suddenly, many of his SAS are often prescient: a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime has killed several senior officials, he told the story in "the Road to Damascus."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In "the Shadow of Benghazi," he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In 1980, it featured the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in Cairo "conspiracy," a year before the attack.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In October 2012, in "panic in Bamako," he chronicled the 4X4 columns of jihadists that based on the Malian capital.

I am not a prophet, defended G√©rard de Villiers, I am simply assumptions from country I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions.
