<seg id="1">The black box in your car? "</seg>
<seg id="2">While the road planner of the United States, the saga Highway System for the shortage of funds are wondering if, there are many people from the small and a solution in the black box, which is on the dashboard of your car as to fit.</seg>
<seg id="3">This device, which is run by the driver of a motor-vehicle Salavasi every mile of the track and the information is transmitted to the authorities, the main streets of the United States, today's Finance - who have been to the old system to restoration of Washington and the State Planning Office for a controversial has become an issue of the effort.</seg>
<seg id="4">Usually Highway as boring work is also planning a deep and lively debate has become an issue of alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">You have the drive by a mile, and probably has the drive to keep details of the place - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - the government to use these black box in favor of giving permission for securing support liberatarian with environmental groups.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is bhauchkki.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberty Union also take the different kinds of privacy issues, is very worried.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the Congress, this could not agree on the fact that there is need to take further action or not, many don't wait for the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are doing this discovery that in the next decade, how they can be in such a system, in which the driver on the road fixed to pay for each mile.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motor-drivers for a test drive has already has taken the black box, which in some of the GP S. Monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is, in fact, for our country is an object.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It was elected by us or not, it is not a matter of being elected." This is to say that the South California of Ikhrata Hasan, the government is executive director of the union, which until the year 2025 motor-drivers in California fixed by every mile of the track to start planning.</seg>
<seg id="13">We can pay by a change in the way of this is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the technology to do.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main reason for this is that the Highway Trust Fund around the country has become insolvent, whose finance-up at the gas pump by the American citizens to pay the taxes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The American people don't buy the gas before now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now a gallons of gas in the car more miles from the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the federal tax a raise in the last 20 years, which is 18. 4 cents per gallon.</seg>
<seg id="19">The high price of gas for politicians, even a penny increase in the tax to sobriety.</seg>
<seg id="20">Transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota Lee Munich says, "is not quite Swahney the gas tax."</seg>
<seg id="21">The state of their per-mile payment system to test the recently in tracking device Shyesta 500 cars.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says, "in the longer term, the most reasoned will work in the form of options."</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks mileage-based user fees, it says.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not surprising that the urban liberals think this is good, because it, for example, the car to a change in the ways to be a change in the tax, which is to reduce the jam and greenhouse gas reduction can help in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">The California planner are eager for this system when he was the state's MahaTvakankshi a target set out in the global warming legislation to assist fully developed.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the head of the Interior Transport Committee, die. Shuster (to the bill. - WAPDA A.), the black box also the most Vyawahare long-term option.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, the independent vendors in the region foundation per mile by the drivers are in favor of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Vice-chairman of the Policy in the region, Adrian Moore said, "This is not the only such a tax, which is being in the blind well."</seg>
<seg id="29">The people who are trying to get something, the more direct way for her payment.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this campaign, the two former American transport is also support the secretaries, who in the year 2011, with the Congress in his report per-mile proceed in the direction of the payment of grace.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S.. The Senate has a 90-million dollars in the last year's test was approved of the project, including 10, 000 cars would have been involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the rural law-makers on the concerns of the work, which is a representative of the Hanguraja people who go to work every day, or in the city a lot more miles to go to walk, the leadership of the House, the proposal to end on.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, many of the state and the city itself forward in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is the most keen Regan, who in the use of the country's largest 5, 000 are listed by the driver.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is the driver of the state soon mileage instead of the gas tax will pay the fee.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada had already completed the initial test.</seg>
<seg id="37">The New York City is also in this direction is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois on a limited basis, with the trucks Azmis.</seg>
<seg id="39">And I-95 Alliance, including the eastern seaboard with 17 State Transport Department (Maryland, Pennsylvania, including Virginia and Florida) are included, the study of the fact that they are doing what kind of implementation of this change.</seg>
<seg id="40">This idea has not found support all the places.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where some time ago 50 voluntary car on the cars of the drivers to this device had been planted, the driver can think this was very impatient that the government to monitor his every step.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevada strategic and work in the department of transport - to be directed to the performance management, Alauddin Khan says, "Big Brother and the same kind of worry about the other things was the main problem."</seg>
<seg id="43">This is not such a thing, which the people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">The test with proceed, Nevada's A. C. L. UK, was given a warning on its website: "These are the full tracking device to change in the device will be easier to a great extent."</seg>
<seg id="45">Huge, Aprbandhniy technology to develop the structure-structure is not a requirement, which came the day of every person-to keep a record of being a Falana was inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada from those in many states, which is to get a sustainable technology is trying to do, with the help of the state that this could get the details of the fact that the car is going on how many miles per day, but it's not that where and what time it is going.</seg>
<seg id="47">Khan said that if you can do it, so people can feel more comfortable. "</seg>
<seg id="48">The search of this technology to some state agencies to miles, a small start-up of California.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm basically by the state to help drivers was not in the business.</seg>
<seg id="50">This auto insurance at the Customa attempt to enter the market was doing, in which the drivers on the basis of their miles had to pay.</seg>
<seg id="51">But this is a device which is tested, it was good to yojana Highway, because it GP S. Does not use and is very limited information, which uploaded by modem at the interval of time.</seg>
<seg id="52">The main Adisase rayon true mileage Morrison said, "If you have the speed of the people and not to track their location, they have to opt in this way will be more willing."</seg>
<seg id="53">In these early programs of the state, some big mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="54">To do so much less lavish and also the way to reduce the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, the planner of the drivers different options are using to.</seg>
<seg id="56">They GP S. With or without a GP S. You can choose the device.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or any of the device can choose not to, but by the residents of the state to decide on the basis of the average miles can choose to set fees.</seg>
<seg id="58">There is hope to other places that instead of the less in the device and concerned citizens by providing more facilities to determine if it can be now.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, a transport official efforts to develop taxing device, including parking meters to pay the fee will be the same, "according to his drive payment" will provide insurance, and the other from the operators of the real time speed will create a collection of data which Qadianist motor-drivers to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">The city planning has been mentioned in the document, "motor-drivers it because of the benefits it will be attracted to the participation."</seg>
<seg id="61">However, some of the yojana transport is a surprise that perhaps miles of the discussion on the payment of the great fervour.</seg>
<seg id="62">San Francisco Metropolitan Transport Commission in the Gulf region, has said that the increase in the gas tax and the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund very easy to tackle the problem.</seg>
<seg id="63">The hybrid or other cars on the drivers of the additional one-time or even the annual fee can be AYES, whose vehicle was very much do not use gas so that they pay the right side.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scientists on this issue and has put the light that the antics of the tail of the dog and then what is the relationship between in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Previous research has found that the Naved dog his tail are more shake the right (the dog), while the restless dogs to their tail mainly are more left to shake.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that the fellow dog-tailed this can identify the subtle differences and can express their response.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this study, published in the Journal current biology.</seg>
<seg id="5">Trento neuroscientist professor from the University of Georgia vellrtigra said: "All of this in humans know very well that the left and the right part of the brain that in the excitement, including the different manner that generated the positive or negative feelings."</seg>
<seg id="6">Here, we also in the other species, it has decided to see.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that even in the dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order, and in the spirit of two golarddhon has played different roles.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this regard to know more than that the dog and other dogs how on the unilateral move by the reaction, the researchers see films of the other dogs tracked the animals.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was the heart of the domestic dogs measured the Dhadkan and analysis of their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="10">We understand, probably did not take more time in that one side of his tail, on the other hand, why is shaken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prof. vellrtigra said: "We have the dogs with the films of the dog-realistic version presented or Uljhan who in other issues to deal with in the images, and we could see the tail and the tail can submit the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animals to their tail a stolid dog on the right (the dog) saw shake, they are completely from the rest.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when he was tailed by changing the direction of the left side of the main form of a dog (again) looked like, his heart was increasing and they Dhadkan uneasy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prof. According to vellrtigra they don't think that the dog through these antics intentionally dialogue with each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, they think that the dogs, it is learned from his experience that they must be worried at the Harkat what and what is not on.</seg>

<seg id="4">This is not any evidence of the fact that the hormone or any other chemicals may be given to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">The experts believe that the obesity indignation, in the age of puberty may be one reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the time the first case of the youth is not as effective in the boys'</seg>
<seg id="7">CNN recently. The former press Pat Etheridge children's health and family issues are expert journalist.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whether the mother should be worried, if his daughter was 7 or 8 years of age, in the development of the breasts and genital hair to start out?</seg>
<seg id="9">Rolando this week, the American children's medical academy in Florida's annual conference in Bal Therapy Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz clarified that these initial physical change is a common phenomenon in the American girls, it's the new fashion show.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kaplowitz says, "I'm very little time to rely on their parents that I'm in - that this is usually quick progress in the direction of the youth don't count."</seg>
<seg id="11">The visible symptoms such as the development of the breasts to Amkuriat, vagina and cash hair and physically smell from the time the first signs in the girls.</seg>

<seg id="14">"When there are beginning to be developed breast, the first rjodarshan at least two to three years." Kaplowitz, which "pre-time in the girls': This is a common problem guide necessary to deal with." Is also the author of the</seg>
<seg id="15">The development of youth, the most accurate test is time.</seg>

<seg id="23">The other big problem can be understood: Guardian just don't want that his age, the daughter of the monthly-religion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Caplovithj said, "the risk of pregnancy, they worry about, or how it is that they will maintain cleanliness."</seg>

<seg id="76">Baratz said, "this is the law of the parents is a facility of this fact that they are not in their you do not take any decision."</seg>
<seg id="77">This gives them, "male" or "female" by some test before writing to understand the right way and the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan euros given the option to the dissolution of the Scots</seg>
<seg id="2">And one day, one of the fear of independence and the story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, we have been warned that the E. UK membership in the form of the condition of the independent travel sector in the whole of Europe in the form of an independent Scotland would need to.</seg>
<seg id="4">The passport control on the Berwick and Hadrian resemble a wire on the walls of the border of the stories about.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is true that the Strathclyde papers with the rest of Europe, the potential economic benefits of independent travel in the description, though - as Purvanumanit - did not mention it in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did any of the description that the E. UK member of his time to his formal rules to spend less.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since it is not the Schengen area of Scotland, in fact Scotland from Brussels, therefore, who is also wanted, he continued in the return of non-compliance will be cheaper left for Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, then, non-story. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the thing that is limping from such a long time, he has been frozen. First, I "is the meaning of freedom passport control" Babaniyaz news was heard about 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, this interesting to the old story again was lost in the interesting point.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the Europe from an independent Scotland bidding why should expect to?</seg>
<seg id="12">The Brussels yoke of London's why for domestic sales, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here the real European news: The great to the united Europe, finally stopped the plan after the war.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, the project in Europe officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">The entire E. UK in E. The UK, or the euro in the form of a common currency for the party to close to gain strength.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany also yuroskeptil Alternative for Germany, the party - which is only this year, suddenly in the federal election in September and nearly five million votes were received, and thus free Democrats (smtuly of our own Libaas Dems) out of the Bundestag effectively.</seg>
<seg id="17">The federal plan to the construction of Europe's always has been the domestic opposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical privrtancark.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berlin, and have been installed by the European Central Bank, with strict rules, the common currency through to compliance with the national economies have Shyesta barriers on the very people is being compared to think that the project is too far gone to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="20">Excessive budget deficit of the national governments in the euro crisis was not much of a role - it is only in the case of Greece was the truth.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the euro system to its members in favor of the German exporters, the currency exchange rate stable-such a thing that want to maintain the German politician.</seg>
<seg id="22">The domestic currency without the possibility of Avmulyn, southern Europe, in comparison of his M.K.R.F Germany implies that the loss of productivity in the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is the only way to pay and the public expenditure -- which has been encouraged by the Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">The current budget and currency problems much further deep European productivity Ruganda.</seg>
<seg id="25">Consumers at the expense of French and German energy firms to provide a rebate to-Brussels was Shyesta by the "green" energy policies as a result, the European industry, in comparison to the United Nations double for electricity and four times the payment for the gas.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the cost of the damage to the disabled, which we have already seen in the Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everyone in the world could be fries salaries, the European petrochemicals industry cheap U.S.. The shell is not being affected by the gas can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, the spirit of revolt in the people again flares up, especially in France, which sometimes E. The UK's main fans.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the youth, France's top politicians E. UK to keep control of the Germany, and the Paris Washington equal billing in the world to offer was seen in the form of measures.</seg>
<seg id="30">But now the political legitimacy to Berlin for the Paris in the form of a passport is not needed, and it your own on Europe's economic policies are implemented, because of France's economy, which has been innocents.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: The Marine Lee Payne's right wing, UK anti-National Front has recently Customa Upchunav in third place in the ruling Socialist dhkelte Customa victory.</seg>
<seg id="32">By this time in France Front 24 percent of the vote is the most popular with the party - this athsma warning for the British Labour is that they can't make it clear that the dissolution of the left, right to the benefit of Haaga.</seg>
<seg id="33">Lee Payne French white, working class in the middle of his new found fame is doing what?</seg>
<seg id="34">The next year, the group E. UK in the European Parliament, the use of the polls. UK rival, the intersection currency wants to create a rival group.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is possible, too, in these elections. UK opposition party is a good performance, the first time this type of group by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">My point is this: In Europe soon. UK Shabbirâ and the intersection of anti-currency spirit will the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Bureau, will not end completely, but this futCr "(arena) countries of Europe," as will reach back in any form, which will have the support of General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and its and some ArthvyavasthaAn can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will start his mudaran again.</seg>
<seg id="39">"I expect that the U.S. njdikian with in the hope of increasing the UK himself will away from this project.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the pacific Washington's growing interest in the signal that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">In what will be the most crusades Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We have little area of England (required) can choose to be made.</seg>
<seg id="43">The economic interests of his own, or we can protect - including Berlin and Brussels on the right time to be different.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think that Scotland loose and better performance in the European system can execute, provided that we keep their own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The non-federal countries in Europe and other countries who think the same miljulkr will be easy to work with.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we Norway walking on the road to maintain their economic independence should think about.</seg>
<seg id="47">Scotland in N. P. - Ullekhnniy as a government-in Europe, the most successful anti-parsimony has been a political campaign, which Alistair Labor's Chancellor Darling proposed (and) carried out by the cuts, and the Tory-Libaas dam after him on the basis of the coalition's majority in the year 2011 was won.</seg>
<seg id="48">For Scotland this time to vote for independence will be talking nonsense, because in that case it is to be installed by Brussels and Berlin Wall will have to accept the rules of parsimony.</seg>
