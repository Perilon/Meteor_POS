<seg id="1">Black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">While the u.s. road Planner, to repair the collapsed highway systems are struggling with lack of funds, there are many people that are looking at the small black box solutions that fit your car dashboard cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="3">This device, which is motor-driver vehicle tracks each mile run and transmit that information to the authorities, to finance America's main streets-nowadays to have been old system renovations to Washington and the State Planning Office strives to be a controversial issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Generally, highway planning and intensive debate lively as boring work suddenly became an issue of alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">You drive by the mile, and possibly drive the location tracking – and then use this information to prepare tax bills-these black box to allow to raise endorsed libertarian side of environmental groups to get along.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tea party bhauchakki.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is also taking a variety of privacy issues very worried.</seg>
<seg id="8">While Congress could not agree on further action to take, many States are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They're looking for that in the next decade they might be in such a system, in which the driver is on the road to pay for each mile that decide.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motor-drivers, test drive already has taken the black box, of which a few survive in. Monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is really essential for our country object.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is our chosen or not chosen is not a matter of" it says Hasan ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Government of that year in California by 2025 were fixed by motor-drivers to track each mile is planning to start.</seg>
<seg id="13">We change the way you pay taxes is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="14">To do this technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is the main reason that the nation's Highway Trust Fund nearly went bankrupt, which finance nutrition American citizens by paying taxes on the gas pump.</seg>
<seg id="16">The American people don't buy now as gas.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now-a-gallon gas in the car more miles.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last 20 years in a federal tax hike, which is 18.4 cents a gallon.</seg>
<seg id="19">Due to the high price of gas a penny tax increase to politicians avoided.</seg>
<seg id="20">University of Minnesota transportation policy expert Lee munikh says, "is not exactly sanvahniya gas tax."</seg>
<seg id="21">Their State has per-mile pay system to test the recently planted tracking device in 500 cars.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says, "as long as this policy will serve as an alternative the most."</seg>
<seg id="23">Mileage-based user fee it winches.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not surprising that the idea looks good to urban Liberals, because it makes the car run, for example, to change the way tax changes, which reduce jams and could assist in reducing greenhouse gas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Look forward to this California Planner system while they mahatvakankshi the State global warming law targets are developing strategies to complete.</seg>
<seg id="26">But House Transportation Committee Chairman, RIP. Bill shuster (r-PA) also the most viable long-term alternatives to the black box.</seg>
<seg id="27">The region Foundation independent vendor driver are paid by the mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">VP, Adrian Moore of the policy in the region, said, "it is not doing so well in the blind."</seg>
<seg id="29">People who are receiving something, are paying for directly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The two former u.s. Transportation Secretaries have also supported by who in its report in the year 2011 Congressional pay per-mile move in the direction of grace.</seg>
<seg id="31">The u.s. Senate last year approved a $ 90-million test project, which involved 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But work on the concerns of rural law-makers, who are representative of individuals who daily go to work or to go much higher in the city have led to mile walk to offer him the House ended there.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, many State and city suo are moving in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is most interested in using the nation's largest Oregon 5000 driver are listed.</seg>
<seg id="35">These are the gas instead of the State driver soon will pay mileage charges.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed initial testing.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City also is moving in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="38">Based on the limited trucks run with Illinois.</seg>
<seg id="39">And I-95 Coalition, which with 17 East sibord State Department of transportation (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying whether they can change what kind of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="40">The idea did not find support at all venues.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nevada, where shortly before 50 voluntary car drivers was planted this device on the cars, the drivers were very impatient this thing thinking that the Government could monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevada Department of transportation strategic and performance management to direct, allauddin Khan says "big brother and other things to worry about in the same way major problem."</seg>
<seg id="43">It is not something that people want.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, continue the trial nevada a. c. l. u. On its website warned: "these devices change the tracking device would be fairly easy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Aprabandhaniya technology infrastructure giant, there is no need to develop that everyone likes to keep a record of moving around as inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is one of those very States, which possible to get affordable technology, trying to help the State can receive a car many miles daily, but it's not where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">Khan said if you can do it, so people can feel more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">Looking for this technology has some State agencies the true mileage transported to a small California start-up.</seg>
<seg id="49">This firm is basically in the business of assisting State tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It auto insurance in emerging markets was attempting to, in which drivers pay based on your mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the device is tested, highway planners to, because it contains g. p. s. Do not use and provides very limited information, which of course uploaded by modem at the time interlude.</seg>
<seg id="52">True mileage Chief governing rayon Morrison said, "If you don't track their speed and location, they will be more inclined to adopt this approach."</seg>
<seg id="53">The State has some big mistakes in these early programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">To do so, much less expensive and less ways to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="55">Oregon, Planner drivers are using different options.</seg>
<seg id="56">They live. Rich or live without. You can choose the device.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or you can choose not to do any of the device, rather than State residents by the average miles may choose to set fees based on.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other locations in hope that device instead of worried citizens by providing more convenience can be sold to retention.</seg>
<seg id="59">New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop teachings device, including parking meter fees to pay too, "according to your drive payments" will provide insurance and drivers made a collection of real-time speed data from the will that the motor-driver will be able to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">City planning was mentioned in the document, "motor-driver it due to the benefits it will draw to interact."</seg>
<seg id="61">However, some transportation planners wonder whether perhaps a whole discussion on pay per mile is the big distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">San phrainsisko Bay area Metropolitan Transportation Commission said that by increasing the gas tax Congress bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem very easily disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="63">On the drivers of other cars hybrid or a time or annual fees, which do not use too much gas the vehicle so that they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Commission's Director of legislative and public affairs, raindi rentashelar said, "when aspirin might work with radical surgery for what is needed."</seg>

<seg id="4">New carry-on bags in an overhead bin charges, therefore, small bag under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said that will charge $ 25 if paid in advance, $ 100 will have to wait to get paid if people wait until they are at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said charging passengers $ 100 fee to take care of in advance of acquiring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first and second checked bags in 2008 the airlines charging for.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those who are trying to avoid the passenger charges are stuffing as much as they can carry-on baggage in the overhead compartment stash, it means this is often in less space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fee to bring passengers on board for a method.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said this new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has the most loyal customers of Frontier that overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult to find.</seg>
<seg id="13">Airline passengers who buy tickets in your website it does not give up.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that the next person in that line for a similar bag might give $ 100, whereas a frontier line at the gate a traveler can get a free bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check processes being replaced before the gate fees for passengers to make sure that it is aware of.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new Carrie won't start until the summer-on fees, although a date has not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travellers often baggage fees and other charges about the discontent, but the airline prefer them.</seg>
<seg id="18">He argues that baggage would spend money to handle, and who want the passenger service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Baggage fees on Wall Street as an indication there are that many airline losses after years of air travel to cover the costs of charging enough money.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most, although Carrie-on bag fees are not touched.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. has Carrie-on duty three years ago first started, and fellow diskauntar Allegiant Air later.</seg>
<seg id="22">Such a fee as well as other airline Wizz Air, which is of Hungarian airline consultant Jay sorensen said, and which add-on fees track kitahara.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said the Spirit of Carrie-on brings $ 50 million a year in fees that were estimated in the report of December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executives recently flew in Spirit and passengers at the gate suffered unusual Carrie-on bag fees have wondered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Boarding process which I saw in their airline career was comfortable," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I look out at the gate a gnashing of teeth and battle was expected.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The plane was full and he said it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also coffee, tea, soda, or juice to follow Spirit's $ 2 fee.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier nekha which travellers will take the entire box, soda or juice, and it will give free coffee refills.</seg>
<seg id="30">It still will give off water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways charging for beverages in 2008 briefly tried, but after seven months of complaining travelers after they reneged and any other main airline there followed after.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's passenger if purchased directly from the airline do not carry-on charge on the Frontier of this step to your own website for customers to operate their latest endeavor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines online travel seller Orbitz pays the $ 10 to $ 25 each sold out tickets.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why many airlines go through an online travel agency instead of buying directly from those passengers an incentive to operate.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier however, this sector went ahead.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September, many often took half the flight miles give those customers that these individuals had purchased from an online travel agency</seg>
<seg id="37">25 percent on Wednesday, helped trip miles mileage award slashed.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, an online travel agency has been purchased from a 1000-mile Frontier trip will earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">Also they only buy directly from the Frontier website for travelers to choose your seat in advance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists shed light on the subject and that the dog's tail antics and what is the relationship between his mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Last oversees research has shown that the more your dog happy tails move to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while restless dog his tail to move more to the left of the main form.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow dog can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and responded.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study was published in the bayloji journal karant.</seg>
<seg id="5">University of toronto Professor nyurosaintist from Georgia vellartigra reported: "all humans are well aware that the left and right part of the brain stimulation in different manner that generates positive or negative feelings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here we see it also in other species.</seg>
<seg id="7">He pointed out that humans like dogs in the right part of the brain the left-hand antics and was responsible for the reverse order, and the two hemispheres has played different roles in different emotions.</seg>
<seg id="8">To learn more about this dog with other dogs tails blind-sided by how moving response, researchers have tracked other dogs to see movies of animals.</seg>
<seg id="9">They measured heart pet dogs dhadkanon and their behavior analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="10">We will take more time in understanding his rump shaking, on the other hand, a side so why ever.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pro. Vellartigra said: "we have dealt with dogs dogs movies-confused that realistic version or other issues to deal with shadow-pictures, and we could see the action of the tail and tail present more left or right."</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animal has a lackluster dog his tail on the right side (from the point of view of the dog), he looked completely comfortable waving.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when he replaced the tail direction mainly on the left side (from the point of view of the dog again) has seen his heartbeat as you rotate and restless.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pro. According to vellartigra they don't think dogs through these antics were deliberately communicate to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from experience that they should be concerned on how to act and what not.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "If you have met several times with other dogs, and if they move their tails to one side are constantly so it's more friendly behavior, and right part presents less friendly behavior, you experience response."</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers say these findings owners, veterinarians and trainers to provide better information about the feelings of animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">University of Bristol School of veterinary sainsez guest fellow, dogs behavior expert John Bradshaw pointed out that it is not the first study to test whether dogs is important to the left or right part.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year the University of Lincoln's team found that when given an aggressive dog dog, my head pan left and right your head on clockwise looking at the dog.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "contrary to Italian studies-when the robot dog's tail was left rather than right hilai, instead of being restless dogs more likely to reach near him."</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that the difference was because of the different studies in animals or robots dog movies dogs were not completely canine.</seg>
<seg id="22">He explained that it reacts by real dogs dogs can help to study how to.</seg>
<seg id="23">"While much of the evidence from various mammals found two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, is still receiving more detailed information-and in this case, the dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>

<seg id="9">Its name is "dare to win", and Barack Obama's presidential election campaign of sansmarika of the year 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm with my patients pamphlets are on the bed and the phursata finds this book I take a round in which politics has inspired millions and keep your breath preventing speech.</seg>

<seg id="12">My classmates were fun in the eyes of the Teardrop, and my parents kept the newspaper each save.</seg>

<seg id="32">Nevertheless I gave above as examples, they mostly seem to be elected by the Administration itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will make you the most annoying.</seg>

<seg id="35">Erased Romney has presented a confusing and uncertain options that determine their policies or their Office would seem to not like.</seg>
<seg id="36">I thought Obama for a second term, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, will complete the hopes which we hear for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="4">There is no evidence that hormone replacement therapy or other chemicals may be to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that coarseness in the age of puberty, the outbreak may be one reason</seg>

<seg id="8">What mother should be concerned, if his daughter at 7 or 8 years of age develop breasts and genital hair just to get started?</seg>
<seg id="9">In orlando, Florida this week at the annual Conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul kaiplovitj has explained that it is common practice in American girls initial physiological changes, these represent a new trend.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kaiplovitj says, "I have very little time to unleash it spends parents rely – that generally this full demonstrates the rapid progress towards puberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Characteristics such as breasts develop direct germinate, genital and armpit hair and body odor girls prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="12">But over the past four decades, rajodarshan (first monthly-religion) at the age of very minor changes.</seg>
<seg id="13">The United States, average age 12 years, what year was 1970 12.75.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When the first breast started to be developed rajodarshan takes at least two to three years to" kaiplovitj explains that "in time-East girls puberty: this is necessary to tackle the problem are the author of the Guide.</seg>
<seg id="15">Puberty is the most accurate test development time.</seg>
<seg id="16">What is the beginning of puberty, would argue about this, but when 8 years old before breast development would increase with two "child-adult".</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases it will slow the process or will freeze-which can closely inspect the hair doctor.</seg>
<seg id="18">In case of more rapid progress by endocrinologist may be required so that your chances of serious problems like tumors or s &amp; ystem.</seg>
<seg id="19">Time-monthly-religion and to delay the treatment results are: increased time ribs, underdeveloped Southeast age – and as adults may be undersized.</seg>
<seg id="20">Drug treatments for hormone replacement therapy or shantytowns, the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and depend on emotional adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="21">The psychological aspect is also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaiplovitaj are aware about drugs but admits, "puberty may increase vyavharatmak to press the issue, and the girls look different from their peers to realize."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their daughter of monthly age-religion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaiplovitaj said, "they tend to worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they won't keep maintain hygiene."</seg>
<seg id="25">One woman, whose daughter 10 year was started in the umre recalls, "it was shock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were signs of this and we are also talking about monthly-religion, but he was not emotionally ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">He returned to his school scared and worried that its started her first menstruation in sahelian.</seg>
<seg id="28">Precocious puberty causes lots of suprachlit theory.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, this is not a sustainable evidence that hormone replacement therapy in eatables, milk or other chemicals in the environment or in the media accused the yaunonmukhi messages.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys like girls too-are receiving time-East youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaiplovitaj this rule set that the main reason for the outbreak of coarseness.</seg>
<seg id="32">He year 2001 6 to 9-year-old girls had helped conduct the study above, the body fat with the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other results support this conclusion, but there are so many other factors that also contribute.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls before puberty girls your age in the tendency to get Belle.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are many explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Global level, time-ranging from economic conditions before puberty parameters, weather &amp; jeans, all things appear to be affected.</seg>
<seg id="37">Other puzzle: Although guy facial and genital hair gaining at a young age, but full of puberty plays one of them girls than is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="38">A. a. p. other practitioners to be present at the Conference the topic jatiltaoen.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even babies and children also saw common muhanse and genital hair.</seg>
<seg id="40">Childrens hospital at the monastery, New Jersey grab physician endocrinologist, Dr. Laurens Silverman exhibit says, "we need to be careful about is that we recognize what kind of actual start puberty."</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents feedback about this guide to your child's doctor should not hesitate to take his children how to speak.</seg>
<seg id="42">Kaiplovitj has advised, "it may be premature to talk required."</seg>

<seg id="10">This interesting anecdote in passing the interesting point was lost.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anyway to free Scotland from why should Europe's bidding?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why the yoke of Brussels London purchasing sales, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the actual European news: Europe to organize the great, a post-war plan eventually freeze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Euro crisis, project Europe officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">The whole e. In e. Opposed to euro as currency or similar to stop are firmly dedicated team.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, Germany yuroskeptil alternative for party-founded this year has only come in the federal election of September — suddenly nearly five million votes received, and thus free Democrats (equivalent to our own lib Dames) effectively out of the bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Federal plan to build Europe's always domestic opposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis proved a radical parivartankarak.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berlin and the European Central Bank at the same time, rigid rules imposed by equal exchange to comply through national economies due to the constraints on many people having to think the project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">National Governments of the euro's excessive budget deficit wasn't too much role – it is only in the case of Greece was the truth.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system has its members in favour of the German exporters to stabilize currency exchange rates – something that German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Domestic currency devaluation without the possibility of Germany, southern Europe compared himself with the underlying loss in productivity.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only way to pay and reducing public expenditure-which has been encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">The current budget and currency problems have further deep European productivity than morbidity.</seg>
<seg id="25">Consumers ' expenditure to provide discounted French and German energy firms – put up by Brussels "green" energy policies as a result, European industry compared to the power of the United Nations to pay for gas doubled and quadrupled.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's going to cripple the cost disadvantages, which we've seen before in grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everyone in the world get a salary freeze, European petrochemicals industry affordable. Shell gas can save from being affected by.</seg>
<seg id="28">The result is a sense of rebellion broke out in people, especially in France, which e. Main fan.</seg>
<seg id="29">After France's top politicians yuddh has e. To control the Germany, and Paris in the world to provide equal billing to vanshigtan measures.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin is now political legitimacy as a passport to Paris is not required, and has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is why France's economy will be shaky at.</seg>
<seg id="31">Results: marine Le Pen's right-wing, e. Anti national front recently ranked third in the by-elections, the ruling by pushing the Socialist victory.</seg>
<seg id="32">This time, with 24 percent of the vote in France is the most popular party front — it is time for the British Labour warning that they cannot assume that the collapse, for right to left automatically returns heaga.</seg>
<seg id="33">Le Pen French whites, working class with its new found fame?</seg>
<seg id="34">The following year this team e. Use the polls in the European Parliament e. Cannot access common currency, wants to make an outfit.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is quite possible, these elections e. Opposition do well so the bloc could affect the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">My approach is this: soon in Europe, e. Anti and cannot access common currency will wreck the euro convergence of conflicting emotion.</seg>
<seg id="37">The euro will not completely, but it is retail "(sovereign) Nations of Europe" will be back in some form such as that of General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and its retainer can maintain some euro economies are interlinked, but France and southern Europe will restart its currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that the u.s. hopes of keeping close with. Keep yourself away from this project.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the growing interest of vanshigtan in the Pacific indicate that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">These are the most after Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We little England area (essentially) can be made.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can protect its own economic interests — in which Berlin and Brussels to tell apart at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think Scotland loose European system could better performance, provided that we keep their own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Non-federal countries in Europe that countries get other similar easy to work with.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we go the route of narve about maintaining its economic independence must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="47">S.n. in Scotland. Government-ullekhnaniya as-anti-austerity in Europe's most successful political campaigns, who proposed by the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling (and executing) opposed to reductions and then stumbled on the-lib based on Dame Coalition won the majority of the year 2011 was amazing.</seg>
