<seg id="1">Black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">While the U.S. road planner, that the highways are facing a shortage of money for improving the system, there are many people see the solution in the small black box, which is fit from the washing on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">This device, the motor vehicle run by the driver each mile to the track and to transmit the information to officers, the main roads of America today have been old for nutrition to finance the restoration of the system to Washington and the issue has become a controversial effort for state planning office.</seg>
<seg id="4">Usually as boring highways planning work also suddenly became the issue of intensive debate and lively alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">You have to drive by miles, and perhaps drive the details of the location and then use this information for the tax bill prepared to allow the government to use the black box with the Libreteriin for support in favour of environmental groups.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tea Party Bhachkrki.</seg>
<seg id="7">American citizen freedom took different types of privacy issues the Union is very concerned.</seg>
<seg id="8">While Congress could not agree on this point is that the action or not, many can't wait for state.</seg>
<seg id="9">How are they doing this search that in the next decade they can be from a system in which drivers on the road, fixed payment for each mile.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motor drivers took the first to test drive the black box, in which some Ji.Pi.Isx Monitrng.</seg>
<seg id="11">This object is really essential for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is not the subject of our being selected or not selected by the Executive Director of the Union," it says the South California Hassan Ikhraata government fixed each mile by the year 2025 in california motor drivers to the start of the track to creating the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="13">By our changes in the way of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="14">For it to technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is the main reason for this is that the country's Finance Trust fund was almost bankrupt, which is up from the payment of taxes on gas pump by American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">Before the American people now buy the gas.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now a car is already more miles in gallons of gas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There was no gain in the last 20 years in federal tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallons.</seg>
<seg id="19">Due to the high price of gas politicians avoid a dime to increase in tax.</seg>
<seg id="20">Transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, "says Lee Muonikh gas and not just Snvhaniy."</seg>
<seg id="21">His state has recently for the per mile payment system to the test 500 cars in the tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says, "in the longer term it will work in the form of the most reasonable option."</seg>
<seg id="23">Wanis says it Maerlej-based user fees.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not surprising that this is the best urban liberals think, because this, for example the car to be changes in taxes, to change in ways that can help in reducing greenhouse gas and to reduce the jam.</seg>

<seg id="28">The vice-chairman of the Policy, Adrian Moore said, "is not only doing it in- which is being blind in well."</seg>
<seg id="29">People are getting things that are more directly paid for it.</seg>
<seg id="30">This campaign has also given support to two former U.S. transportation secretaries, who in his report in the year 2011 has the blessing of Congress to proceed in the direction of the per mile payment.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved the test project of 90 million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars are lost.</seg>
<seg id="32">But work on rural law- the concerns of the manufacturers, who were the representative of the people who go on daily work or too many miles to go in the city is to be abolished on the leadership of the House, the proposal on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, many state and city self- B are forward in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is the most keen region, who are the largest 5,000 drivers listed in the use of the country.</seg>
<seg id="35">This driver soon Maerlej instead of the state gas tax to pay the fees.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed initial test.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is also moving forward in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="38">The illinois limited became may with the trucks on the base.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with the I-95 East center alliance, which includes the state transport department (Mereelaand 17, including Pensilweniia, Virginia and Florida), this study of talking about how the implementation of this change are that they can.</seg>
<seg id="40">This idea has found support in all places.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where the first 50 voluntary car drivers some time this device was imposed on cars, this thinking the driver was very impatient that the government can monitor his every step.</seg>
<seg id="42">In Nevada Transport Department directed to the strategic management and task performance, "says Alauddin Khan Big Brother and major problem was the same kind of worry about the other things."</seg>
<seg id="43">This is not something that people want.</seg>
<seg id="44">The test E.Si.Al.Ioo. the Nevada, proceed with the full tracking device in the device was warned on its website: "these will be easier to change considerably."</seg>
<seg id="45">The there is no need to develop large, Aprbndhniy technology model structure, which have spread from each person for the day to keep the record as inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada to get from those in many states, the sustainable technology can help, which is trying to state how many miles per day this thing could get the details of that car is going where and what time, but it is not that he is running.</seg>
<seg id="47">Khan said that if you can, so that people can feel more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The search of this technology to the small California start-up called the true Maerlej have some state agencies.</seg>
<seg id="49">This firm was not originally in the business of the state and to help the drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">This Ubharte was trying to enter the market in the auto insurance, which was to be paid on the basis of their Maerlej drivers.</seg>
<seg id="51">But it is doing the test of the device, it's good, because it does not use the Ji.Pi.Isx to Yyojnakaron and provides very limited information is uploaded, by which time spacing on modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">The main the true Maerlej rayon Morrison said, "if you do not track the speed of the people and their location, they will be more willing to opt in this way."</seg>
<seg id="53">There are some big mistakes in the state of these initial programmes.</seg>
<seg id="54">For doing very little to intervene less lavish and also the ways.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, Nepal drivers are using to different options.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose the device Ji.Pi.Isx with or without Ji.Pi.Esx.</seg>
<seg id="57">The state can choose not to or from any device, but residents can choose to the fee set on the basis of the average miles set by.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places in the hope that device instead of the less and more worried by providing the citizens to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device, which will the facility pay the parking meter fees, "according to his drive for" insurance will provide, and which will create the speed of real time data collection from other drivers will be able to use motor drivers to avoid the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">This has been mentioned, "motor driver in city planning document because it will attract for the participation of the benefits to be gained."</seg>
<seg id="61">However, according to some to wonder that perhaps the transport Yyojnakaron miles for discussion on all the big distractions.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Metropolitan Transport Commission in San Fransisco Bay area said that growth in the gas tax and bankruptcy highways Trust fund can tackle the problem very easily.</seg>
<seg id="63">The additional one-time or annual fees on the drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be the vehicle, which is a lot more gas so that they do not use their right of payment.</seg>
<seg id="64">Commission's Legislative and the director of public affairs, Rand Rentshelr said, "when Aamoolchool for her work with aspirin, may need surgery."</seg>

<seg id="6">Frontier spokesman Kate in charge o' the rainbow said that the $100 fee in advance for the care to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">The passengers who are trying to avoid fees Bharai are doing as they can in the Carey-On Bbgej Owrhaed Sstbsh in box, this box means less often in place.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a way to charge less for the passengers on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O' the rainbow said that this new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the place for the most loyal customers that Owrhaed about Frontier bin find rapidly became difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Airbus passengers who don't have to buy the tickets in your website.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that because the next person in line to be a 100 dollars for the same bag, while a passenger in a line on Frontier Gate, can get a free bag.</seg>

<seg id="16">The new Frontier Carrie On fees will not start until the summer, though a date has not been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travelers often express the discontent about Bbgej charges and other fees, but the airline prefer them.</seg>
<seg id="18">He argued that money is spent, and the passenger service for designing Bbgej should want them to pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many see the fees in the form of a signal of the Bbgej that many on Wall Street after the years of Airbus's charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel.</seg>
<seg id="20">The most though not to Carey touched on bag fees.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Spirit Airlines Inc. started for the first time, and partner Diskaooanter Carey on duty three years ago after the Allegiant Air.</seg>
<seg id="22">The other airlines with such a duty is Hungary's Wizz Air, which Airbus consultant Jay Sorensen said, and the aid fees on track patterns.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said that the Spirit Carrie On fee brings in $50 million a year in December 2011 the report estimated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former official has recently the midwest Airlines flight in the Spirit and passengers faced Carey on unusual bag fees on the gate, staking surprise.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process which I had seen in his Airbus career was simple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I hope to see the teeth Peesna and out a gate on the war.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The aircraft was full and he said that this lickety-split over."</seg>

<seg id="29">Frontier Neknva that will take passengers soda or juice stands, they can put the whole box, and this will give for free coffee only once.</seg>
<seg id="30">This will however give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">Us Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks products in 2008, but seven months later, he backtracked after the complaint and any other follow after the Airbus there.</seg>
<seg id="32">If airlines do not buy directly from the Frontier's passenger, Carrie On the Frontier for fees charged to customers for their own website to his latest effort to run this step.</seg>
<seg id="33">This kind of Airlines is to pay the Orbitz online travel sellers have sold $10 to $25 each for tickets.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why all the Airlines instead of through an online travel agency to buy directly from those people an incentive to run for passengers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier however, went further in this area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September many often flight miles from half the distance from which these people for those customers to buy from an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it trips to the miles Maerlej award reduced to 25 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scientists and light on this subject between the antics and his mood in the tail of dogs that are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2">Previous research showed that happy dog right are more shake your tail (dog), while from the point of view of uneasy dog more shake your tail to the left.</seg>
<seg id="3">But scientists now say the companion dog can identify the tail of this subtle distinction and can express their reaction on that.</seg>
<seg id="4">This study the Journal Krnrt Baeyloji has been published in.</seg>
<seg id="5">The professor from the University of Trento neuroscientist Georgia Welllrtigra said: "this is all well know in humans that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different manner in which the excitement generated the positive or negative feelings."</seg>
<seg id="6">Here we attempted to see it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also said that like humans, dogs in the right part of the brain the antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order, and played two different roles in the Golarrddhon feelings.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this to learn more about how dogs by other dogs unilateral the tail on the reaction, the researchers tracked the films of the other dogs look on animals.</seg>
<seg id="9">He measured the throbbing in the heart of pet dogs and the analysis of their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="10">We would it not perhaps more time to understand why one side so that his tail sometimes on the other hand is shaken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prof Welllrtigra said: "we have the dogs with the films presented for the deal with other issues in the realistic version or in the shadow -were in the picture, and we see the HuA of tail and tail can submit more left or right."</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animals a stolid dog the right side (seen from the point of view of dogs) shake their tail, they are completely freely.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when he tailed to change direction on the left side (seen from the point of view of) the dog again, the beating of his heart increased and restless."</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Prof Welllrtigra they not think through the dog these antics were deliberately to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, they think that dogs that he has learned from his experience on what action should be worried about and what not.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "if you have many other dogs get time, and if they are to continue a shake on their tail, it is more related to the practice, and at the right part presents behavior, you do the same reaction on the basis of the experience."</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers say that the conclusion of the owners, animal trainers and doctors can provide better information about the feelings of animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">School of the University of Bristol Wetrneri Va. Fzelo, the dog behavior specialist John Bbredshoh told the guest that this is not the first study to check it is important that dogs left or right for the part or not.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year an aggressive dog to see the team of the University of Lincoln found that when dogs are around his head, left side and are happy to see his head on the right dog.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other research, he said: "Italian Studies of the University of Victoria in Canada, when the robot left than the right tail the dog was ilae, but instead of being regurgitated the dog was more likely to close."</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that this was because the difference in various studies in animals or robot dog films completely dog the dogs were not understood.</seg>
<seg id="22">He explained that this is the way the study can help to the reaction of real dogs by dogs.</seg>
<seg id="23">"While there is enough evidence from different mammals are found that the two parts of the brain used for different purposes, to receive more detailed information is still remaining and dog are no exception in this case," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the is easily their behavior can be recorded, we think that this may not take more time to understand that he never on one side, sometimes on the other hand, why is his tail.</seg>

<seg id="6">AAA said that it plans from some airlines for the extended to the use of portable electronic device on the aircraft already acquired.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and Jetblwo are among the airlines, who are already presented plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">The AAA said in a statement,"based on the status of the plan, we can very quickly approve the expanded use of electronic device.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, the passengers of aircraft need to close the door closed on his Ssmarrtfon, Tablet and other devices.</seg>

<seg id="11">It is expected that from the time they descended the aircraft to take off your device, and the aircraft completely again to do it on.</seg>
<seg id="12">AAA said that, under the new direction instructions by the aircraft to airlines whose aircraft electronic interrupts his passengers are completely safe, they can give a, aircraft, flight time and the time of Tbksiing allowed to use the device.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most of the new Airbus companies and other aircraft that are modified in this way the passengers can use the Wi-Fi on more height, they are expected to meet these standards.</seg>
<seg id="14">The president of the Association of Professional Flight Atenndenrt, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Glading said in a statement, "when will be the safe way the implementation of the policy and we will work together with the airlines for it to companies, it will win the thing for both parties."</seg>
<seg id="16">When it comes to this issue, we do "Hall Monitrrs" as feeling-weary.</seg>

<seg id="27">By using this ban on Afxa.Ax to less pressure has been increasing in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sen. Clear Mbkkaskilk de Mo as critics said that prohibition is not a valid for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The enforcement of these restrictions and also difficult to because the use of the device is so ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies also it indicated that almost a third of passengers are forget or ignore the direction of their device to stop them.</seg>

<seg id="32">The Ilekttrikl system in comparison with the previous generation of the new airlines, aircraft companies, but they are also more dependent on electronic design for resistance to intervention and has been accepted by AAA.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines are coming from passengers on the height Kcroojing Wi-Fi proposed the use for many years.</seg>
<seg id="34">The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi system also interrupts for more resistance.</seg>
<seg id="35">Huerta said that under the new guidelines most airlines companies should get more authentic on the qualifying standards for the use of the electronic device.</seg>
<seg id="36">The time of today's electronic device, in comparison with the previous generation of electronic device emits very low power of Radio Ttransmishn.</seg>
<seg id="37">For example, E Ridrrs, is very nominal Ttransmishn during the leafed page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But do download data or send time by device Ttransmishn are strong.</seg>
<seg id="39">To reduce the restrictions on the use of the device by passengers has in the side of users to Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the year 2011 the company airlines all intended for the Amazon Kindle e-Ridrrs loaded and problems in the procedures for the test but found no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">The device Afxa.Ax Advisory Committee has less mixed feelings about the risks from the use of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="42">The National Union of Douglas learnt aircraft passengers said that they believe that risk is real, the resurrection from the device whether nominal only.</seg>
<seg id="43">The other members of the Committee said that, in support of the Aircraft system to insert the device interrupted by the report only described by the pilot, most of whom are are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the members of the Committee recommended that AAA that allow the pilot the aircraft in low visibility, to allow the time they ordered the passengers to close the device.</seg>
<seg id="45">The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and the general knowledge of people who travel in them, the latest round of technology the facility said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Youth: be large quickly before time</seg>
<seg id="2">Research shows that Hispanics and African-American girls of your age getting youth in Gori than in young girls.</seg>
<seg id="3">This does not mean that youth near the physical changes.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is no evidence that Harmon or any other chemicals may be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that may be one of the causes of the obesity epidemic, youth in the age of.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not before time youth as effective in the case of boys.</seg>
<seg id="7">The former Si.An.An. reporter Pat Aiirij, an expert in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whether the mother should be worried, if the hair of her daughter at the age of 7 or 8 years in the development of breasts and vagina started to go?</seg>
<seg id="9">The American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference in Orlando, Florida this week in Pediatrics Lndokrainolojist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz confirmed that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, this new fashion show.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kaplovitrj says, "I spent very little time in this faith to parents that usually shows this is not the full rapid progress in the direction of the youth."</seg>
<seg id="11">To direct the development of symptoms like the blades of the breasts, hair and physical smell of female and Kaonkh girls in the time before.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in the last four decades has been very little change in the age of the first monthly Rjodrrshn (religion).</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, 12X75 in the year 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When breast, in first Rjodrrshn are beginning to be developed at least two to three years," Kaplowitz says, that "girls in Time-East are also the author of youth: essential guide to deal with this common problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">The development of youth is the most accurate test time.</seg>
<seg id="16">What is the start of the youth, this debate is about, but when growth with breast growth before the age of 8 years is two called it "adult" hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">This process will be slow in most cases can or will be stopped from which hair physician close inspection.</seg>
<seg id="18">More rapid progress in the position by Anldokrainolojist may need to examine the possibilities of the serious problems like Ttyoomrs or Sissst could be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pre-time monthly religion and other results to pre-treatment, for example: the time of the bones age, which may be anaa in the form of undeveloped growth and adult height growth.</seg>
<seg id="20">Drug for treatment or Haormoan Snsstutiian, depends on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional need.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychological aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">About Kaplovitqj drugs are conscious but cannot accept, by pressing the "youth Wyvaharaatmk issue, and girls can take to feel different from his colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="23">The second big problem: not all parents want their daughter under the age to be understood monthly religion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaplovitqj said, "how they worry about the risk of pregnancy, or that he has come from hygiene."</seg>
<seg id="25">One woman, whose daughter was in the 10 years the Oomre menstrual cycle started, remember, "the shock."</seg>
<seg id="26">However, this was also the monthly the symptoms and we were talking about religion, but he was not emotionally ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was scared and upset that his saheliyon pulled from his school in her first menstrual cycle began.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many Suprchliat theory about the causes of premature youth.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, there is no consistent evidence that Haormoan in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or the alleged Iaunonmukhi messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">The boy also pre-time- like the girls are getting the youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplovitqj set the rules that the main reason for the obesity epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was helped in to run the study over the years the girls of 6 to 9 years in 2001, the body's fat associates with the youth of the time.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other results, but there are many other factors that contribute to support this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanics in girls their age before the Leucasis girls is the tendency to get youth.</seg>
<seg id="35">This thing from the very explanation.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the global level, the pre-time youth model, economic conditions are to be influenced by the weather and jeans, all things.</seg>
<seg id="37">Other puzzle: though the boy in the face and the hair of the female young girls are getting them, but the fully youth practice is not as clear.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending AAP Conference in support of the subject's Jtiltaoean.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even the hair of the female Muahaanse and seen common in babies and children.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Moristaooan, Jersey Goryyeb Childrens Hospital children's hospital in Anldokrainolojist, Dr. Lghrens Silpwrman says, "we need to be careful about is that we do the real start of how the identity of youth."</seg>
<seg id="41">The parents should not hesitate in taking guidance from his hair for Roy to physician about how to talk to their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">Kaplovitrj suggested, "talk before the expected time may mean."</seg>
<seg id="43">If you keep quiet, your child will normally answer correctly.</seg>
<seg id="44">The girls need the confidence to ilae to growth before the time that may be happening before this time but it is part of normal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The parents of Inrtrseks Kids can choose their children's'gender Anirrdhariat'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first country of the European Union, with which vague female birth for the third gender to provide recognition for the children.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the man or woman Rtdzigt way to children will not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the new law requires parents to declare such children for sex is not the birth of the child them, this law allows the evidence to declare the letter on gender' Anirrdhariat"or "unspecified."</seg>
<seg id="5">The purpose of the new law for those parents to reduce the pressure that the newborn children can take in decisions related to gender-Nirdimtikrn Shalya medical urgency and Nntrseks to fight discrimination against children.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the BBC a Nntrseks years after the person said, "neither I man, not woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I made by doctors to make Jkhpmi, Stained limply.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to estimates from each year 2,000 children in a child is that it is neither the boy or girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are Nntrseks, part of the group of about 60 conditions, that the word comes under check, this group of disorders of sexual development, which is unusual chromosome Jnngrrnthi (ovary or testes), or abnormally developed used for sex.</seg>
<seg id="10">It may seem that Wallis And Simpson Nntrseks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gender identity is still not properly considered, but most experts in the United States believes that when sex cannot be determined, gender is better to use the best available information and to specify Shalya therapy to inspect by bribing, if, before the child's psychological and physical development.</seg>
<seg id="12">The New York City psychological expert Dr. Jack Dlreshr that the cases of gender-identity, he said that the new law of Germany "appears to be a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Nntrseks children produce moral dilemmas.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said, "some people are in a position like life-crisis for which Shalya not medical need, but with most of the children."</seg>
<seg id="15">You can specify the gender, and without Shalya therapy after to see how that identity is developed.</seg>
<seg id="16">No kind of sex in a child, it will be developed to the science is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No person cannot answer about why that is.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a kind of puzzle that people are gay why.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the year 2011 the Nntrseks Ttransseksual or the people in the report before the European Commission has been described as different from transgender people, because their status is not gender related but is related to its biological composition, which is not so clearly the man or woman but or so both United as any clearly defined from or in both.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can display secondary sexual traits, such as the weight of the muscles themselves, the hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual traits like breeding in part and female; or chromosomal structure and Haormoan.</seg>
<seg id="21">This report Nntrseks and the discrimination faced by transgender people in the area of jobs, and at the same time also provides overview about harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now with non-gender are the special camp for boys.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Australia and Nepal adult people allowed to mark their man, woman or "third gender" on official documents already given.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, the 52-year-old Australian Naqri Welllbi, the legal appeal for life- the "unspecified" sex status to receive recognition after winning the world's first "Lingghin" became the person.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the internal ministry, apart from the German passport in M or F Nntrseks third Nirdimtikrn will be in the form of X for people.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the report on the France 24 news, neighbouring country related to gender issues are still controversial in France.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the year 2011, as the strict dozens of French law from the Catholic country manufacturers have signed a petition for the "gender theory" to go back to the books of the school.</seg>
<seg id="28">The website of the U.S. Catholic online has also opposed the law, saying, "while the Germany is a state in the world, where gender itself is the option selected, but not sexual activity, we are taking in the opposite direction and two pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mereelaand said that the children at the time of the birth of the baby by the mother of the newborn child John will love to be specified gender.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said, "without the additional limits on the website about bringing the Parvarish is very stressful, especially if you do not know what it is that the sex of your child."</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, the children born with both male and female genital to the bisexual Hrmbfrodaits (hermaphrodite) said, which was the name of the beautiful Greek gods.</seg>
<seg id="33">And about time less than a decade ago, the medical world that sex was considered in the form of the slate can be written and then deleted.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many people are giving Shalya the morality of the medical challenge, they understood that gender identity is complicated work, and sometimes mistake than doctors, who may not know that sex will feel about Nirdimtikrn whether your child on being large.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called" the emergency psychiatry" says Dlreshr.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these children were born, so you were not called the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The female unclear about the treatment of children was presented by the existing principle to John Haapkinns University Dr. John Money, who believed that the sex was Sunirmaanniy.</seg>
<seg id="38">He created the word "gender identity" and argued that the social and environmental signal- how do parents bringing children interact with the child's genes and hormones and determined that it should be recognized in the form of the man or woman in the form.</seg>
<seg id="39">But the year 1966, in a case that became known as the "John/Joanne," his controversial theory.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was a child, which eventually penis during sex Lingagrchrrm-Oochchedn (Srrkmsishn), the advice to parents that they allow full Bndhsy of the child and his testicle forest and it brought up like a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">Dreher said, "Money has presented in the form of the successful case of Awsthaanr, but it was not the case."</seg>
<seg id="42">In the age of 15 years, the child married back changed in you as a man and a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But in the age of 38 years, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Yet Dlreshr said that some doctors are trying to "follow" the same model.</seg>
<seg id="45">But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the year 1990 started, the people who come in through these gender Shalya medical "not happy" with the result.</seg>
<seg id="46">This was the case with the 36-year-old author of Mkntana Jim Bruce Aksxwaee., who was born with male chromosomes, but her vagina was unclear.</seg>
<seg id="47">The doctors clearly didn't understand that his penis was small, or the Bhgshef large, but they were sure that he was never in the form of man can live life "not satisfied."</seg>
<seg id="48">So the external part of the year, some time after his birth in 1976, Bruce and his testicle Shalya uprooted by medical and Parvarish the kind of girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">The woman Haormoan in her 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="50">He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not that girl."</seg>
<seg id="51">I was not happy, but very difficult to question.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the age of 18 years, with the to Vajainoprlasti.</seg>
<seg id="53">But unhappy and feel something wrong, he of the demand for medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">This he learned of the horrific reality.</seg>
<seg id="55">I said I never been Bndhsy and a the time of birth.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce, who was born with the DAD, which prevented her body from making sufficient quantities of testosterone because her vagina could not be properly developed.</seg>
<seg id="57">After, he became the man back to reality, he Nvtwa the dose of testosterone Lee and his breast.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Shalya medical because he was childless.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, about Nntrseks people in the organization named Inrtrfes project explains his concept for normal people.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, the's-based legal group the director Anne Tamar-Mattis of Adwoketls for Informed Choice expressed concern that the law of Germany "Chiprpi invite and mark."</seg>
<seg id="61">He says, "many people think that the law of Germany Ekrtiwist inspired" Anirrdhariat "to specify the quick decision to parents and child will."</seg>
<seg id="62">We fear that this will encourage the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think that, man or woman instead of waiting to better specify gender process.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we don't know how his role that law Nibhaabga, so we can only guess.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that his organization does so because "this is the third gender in adults familiar to the support the Australian law allows."</seg>
<seg id="66">He said, "legal adults should be enabled in your own decisions about sex."</seg>
<seg id="67">Related to the law it specified at the time of the birth of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is not the war fought by the children at this time.</seg>
<seg id="69">Large the decision related to his body, he can take themselves.</seg>
<seg id="70">But the breast of the Pittsburgh Rediioalojist Dr. Erin Baratshj whose daughter to help sexual development disorder, and hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law "will provide power to both the parents and children."</seg>
<seg id="71">The daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but it has Anrdrojn Baratbji Asnwednsheelta syndrome a Dee.Es.Di..</seg>
<seg id="72">Since donating his Anrdrojn error was, therefore, Katy developed in female traits.</seg>
<seg id="73">In his body, but the uterus or vagina is not Dinbgprnthi.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now 29-year-old Katy is married and Rejzideant in Pensilwaniia University in child psychology department.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though that he is childless, but the adoption or Gssteshnl Sroouesi through the hope of becoming a mother.</seg>
<seg id="76">The parents Barat said, "this law gives the facility that they urgency you not make any decision in this matter."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is, by some test before 'Men ' or 'female' writing them properly provides understanding and time.</seg>
<seg id="78">In this way, you live right up the child, the love child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a lovely child and take his fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We cannot be back in urgency Shalya is not medical need not to that.</seg>
<seg id="81">He said, "it brings the children and parents in the decision-making process the motive to fix it because they do not believe that they are free from the anxiety disorder."</seg>
<seg id="82">Finally, the child will determine that he is more comfortable with sex -- and it will be very good.</seg>
<seg id="83">This enables the decision for their own children.</seg>

<seg id="1">George KereवAnः euro Sskoas to the dissolution option.</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another story of the fear of freedom</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we warn that the membership of the EU in the form of the condition the need for independent Scotland to join in the form of free travel area in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">The stories about the extent of others on the walls of the passport control and Hbdriin on Brvik wire signal.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is true that Strbthklaid described in the paper about the potential economic benefits of free travel with the rest of Europe, although not as Pooarrwanumanit-Hedlaalns in the description.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody has explained that EU members spend most of their time in his formal rules to change their reservations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now that the Schengen area is not Scotland, so Bbrsels in fact instead of Scotland, which also wants to receive, it will be left in continuous non-compliance for Bbrsels cheap.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, then, a story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that is trapped, he was frozen so long time. I first heard of "freedom means" think like passport control news about 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, this interesting point has been lost in interesting to the old story again.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should independent Scotland from Europe than to the Bidiamg anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why should be buying sales, especially for the yauk Bbrsels of London now?</seg>
<seg id="13">The real European news here: Europe organised to the great post-war planning finally stopped.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Europe has been officially dead project.</seg>
<seg id="15">Close to the opposition of the EU or euro in the form of the common currency in the EU dedicated to getting the team strength.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany Iooroskepptil Alrtrnetiw for Germany, the party was only founded this year suddenly received almost 50 million votes in September's federal election and the Free Democrats (our own libaas Demshs, and this type of time equivalent) to effectively Bunndestbg out.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal was always the plan of domestic opposition to the construction of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical Priwrtnkark.</seg>
<seg id="19">Compliance with the Berlin and the tough rules imposed by the European Central Bank, the common currency to the national economy has been through the project because many people have to consider the obstacles that Europe went too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The very role of the national governments of the excessive budget deficit in the euro crisis was not only true in the case of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the euro system has its members in favour of the German exporters currency-something that German politicians want to keep the exchange rate stable.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency Avmoolyan, southern Europe gets himself in the position than the underlying loss of productivity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is the only way to reduce public expenditure and wage has been encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Further points deep European productivity than on budget and currency problems.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the expenditure of consumers by the French and German energy firms to provide free-Bbrsels was the result of the "green" energy policies, European industry in comparison with the United Nations four times for double for electricity and gas payments.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the cost of a loss to disabled people, which we have already seen in Gprangemawth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the Fzreej to be paid in the world, European Pesrokemikls cannot save the industry from being affected by cheap U.S. gas shell.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, the spirit of rebellion in people, especially in France, which was once the head of the EU fans.</seg>
<seg id="29">After Yoodrdh the top politicians to handle the EU to Germany, France and Paris was seen in the form of measures to provide the Waanshigtn equal billing in the world.</seg>
<seg id="30">But now the need for political validity passport in the form of Paris to Berlin, and it is not Europe on the apply of their own economic policies, which undermined the economy of France.</seg>
<seg id="31">Results: Marine Le Pen of the extreme right-wing, anti-EU National Front, recently the ruling Socialist to third place in the byelection victory.</seg>
<seg id="32">This time the Front with 24 percent of the vote in France as it is the most popular team in due course for the British Labour warning that they can't automatically benefit Baaga for dissolution for that left, right.</seg>
<seg id="33">Lee Payne is doing with his new found fame in French between the white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">The group use the EU elections next year in the European Parliament wants to create a anti-EU, anti-intersection currency group.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is quite possible, anti-EU party good display in these elections, the group of this type can affect the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">My view is this: soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-intersection currency in Europe will kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The euro, will not end completely, but it will reach back in Europe "like a form of retail" (arena), which will have the support of General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and some of the ready Arthvyvsthaan her, can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that, with the UK in the hope of expanding Njdikiiaan will distance themselves from this project.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the growing interest in pacific Waanshigtn indicate that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">After all, what of Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to create from the area of Little England (as required).</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can protect their own economic interests -including Berlin and Bbrsels to tell the right time for being different.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think that Scotland is loose in the European system can better work performance, provided that we keep its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The non-federal countries in Europe would be easy to work with other countries with common thinking here.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should think about maintaining our economic independence, walking on the road.</seg>
<seg id="47">Scotland Ns.An.Pi. government-Wllekhnniy in Europe has been the most successful in parsimony anti-political campaign, which the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling carried out (and) to oppose the cuts proposed by Tory libaas des and thereafter on the basis of the coalition's majority was won in the year 2011.</seg>
<seg id="48">This time for Scotland to vote for independence in Berlin and it will be absurd, because the position Bbrsels will be imposed by accepting the rules of parsimony.</seg>
