<seg id="9">Those who are trying to avoid the passenger duty Bharai are doing as much as they can in baggage On Carey - which is overhead stays in boxes, it means there is often little space in the box.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a way to pay less for passengers on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O' uglier said that it is not in fact about the new charge of funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the most loyal customers about the Frontier is that it has become increasingly difficult to find a place of overhead bin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Airlines passengers to buy tickets on his website has to do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">It means that the reason is that the next person in line for the same bag may give 100 dollars, while a passenger in a line at the gate Frontier, you can get a free bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O' uglier said Frontier's website and A-M|Czech before they get the gate is being converted for the procedures to ensure travelers know about the fee.</seg>

<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street in fees as a gesture of baggage see that after many years of deficit ones are charged with enough money to cover the cost of air travel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Carey - although the majority don't even touched on the bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="21">The duty on Carey - Spirit Airlines Inc. started for the first time in the past three years, and Allegiant Air, a fellow discount later.</seg>

<seg id="25">" was at the boarding process that I had seen in his career ones," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I hoped to see pisna teeth and a fight outside the gate.</seg>

<seg id="29">Frontier Nakhi that passengers will take zoos soda, or they can put the whole box, and give it a free coffee for the only time.</seg>

<seg id="31">Us Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks products in 2008, but seven months later after complaining of passengers after they moved back and is there any other major ones follow one|.</seg>
<seg id="32">If the crew of Frontier 's Airlines from Carey - don't buy directly on his own website on the steps of Frontier to charge fees for customers to run to his latest effort.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines like the Orbitz online travel sellers have to pay for the tickets have sold out of every 10 to 25.</seg>
<seg id="34">The reason is that many Airlines buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency has been given an incentive to run for the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the subject of scientists and light in the act of the tail of the dog that he and his mood is whether relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is learned from previous research that happy dogs are more Hillate on the right on his tail (from the point of view of a dog), while its tail on the left side of the main form of restless dogs are more Hillate.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now the scientists say that the companion dog can identify the subtle distinction of the tail and can express their reaction to it.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study was published in the journal current biology.</seg>
<seg id="5">University of Georgia professor from Taranto neuroscientist wellrtigra said: "This |*.xml|All in humans are well aware that excitement that the left and the right part of the brain that are involved in a different way to generate positive or negative feelings."</seg>
<seg id="6">Here we have attempted to do it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that, like humans, dogs in the right part of the brain responsible for the act of his left hand and the opposite order was, and two different roles in the golardhon feelings Abbasi|.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the dog and other dogs to learn more about this unilateral move the tail on how to respond, see the films of the other dogs tracked to animals.</seg>
<seg id="9">He Dhadkan at the heart of pet dogs to measure and analyze their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="10">We understand that their tail may take more time because one side never, ever, on the other hand shaking.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prof. Wellrtigra said: "we have introduced with films of dog breeds of dogs to deal with other issues in a realistic version or to the confusion in the shadow picture, and we could see the tail unfriendly and the tail could offer more left or right."</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animals from the point of view of a dog, a stolid dog on the right side of his tail) Hillate seen so they're completely from the rest.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when he changed the direction of the tail mainly on the left side of his heart looked like (restart from the point of view of a dog) Dhadkan respectively.During and they look puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Prof. wellrtigra dogs through the act did not think they were deliberately trying to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, they think that the dog had learned from this experience is that they do not acted on and on what should be worried.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "If you have met several times with other dogs, and if they are Hillate on one side of the tail, so it is more concerned with the Dostana behavior, and at the right part presents Dostana behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience."</seg>
<seg id="17">, the owners say that these conclusions, animal trainers and doctors can provide better information about the feelings of the animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">University of Bristol's School of vetrneri Sciences fellow the guest of dog behavior expert John Bradshaw has said that it is not the first study to investigate whether left or right for dogs is an important part or not.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year University of Lincoln's team found that when dogs are if you see an aggressive dog on the left side of his head and happy to see the dog at the right side of his head.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, said: "contrary to the Italian study - when the robot was hilly on the left side to the right of the tail of the dog, and the dog was more likely to the close instead of being puzzled."</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that this was because the difference because the dog films in various studies in animals or robot dogs do not understand the full dog.</seg>
<seg id="22">He made clear that the real dogs by the dog's reaction to the study of the ways you can help.</seg>
<seg id="23">" while different mammals are found enough evidence of the fact that the two parts of the brain is used for different purposes, to get a more detailed information is still the rest - and, in this case, dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">The reality of the present is a hard truth, for example, to return to the world of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="17">The hope is hard to remember those days seem a distant memory, they are a tragic reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">I was really change after proposing by voting for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Simple as, say, it couldn't have any idea.</seg>

<seg id="21">In addition, I believe it is unfair to protest the policy has prevented a lot of proceeding with the efforts of our country is in immigrant reform, health care, in addition to the public option, to Airport closed on Guantánamo Bay, and others are included.</seg>
<seg id="22">But Asanga times where I take the side of the Obama administration before you of your colleagues and friends - they may have the answer for me that I can give them.</seg>
<seg id="23">I reached the point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">The foreign policy of the Republican opposition leaders of intelligence is not the answer, not just north of Drona attacks on innocent children in foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">About the private lives of ordinary American citizens by the National Security Agency, it may not be the answer to store the data is not only wrong act of the government of light can give an answer to the people of prosecution.</seg>

<seg id="29">I don't know whether I was expected of it.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at the age of 18, I guess it must was that the government system, it can bring the Revocation of a political campaign.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is directly elected office a predictably, there is no way, because the opposition political parties and random events such as the nyutawn massacre, we will provide the size of the public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, I have given up as an example, they are often be chosen by the administration of itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is most worried about you.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not so that I recognise from his opponent.</seg>
<seg id="35">And one has to be a part Romney presented an option, which it did not appear to determine his policies or his office.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, who will be free from the pressure of elections in the future, they will complete the hopes about which we are hearing from a long time.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, while Obama is less than 45 percent of the Anumeadn rating this week, going through the book of the year in 2008, it has become very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">I see it disappeared into the memory of suits.</seg>

<seg id="1">By the time the first youth: Soon to be bigger</seg>
<seg id="2">Research shows that African American and hispanics Girls in comparison of white girls of her age at the age can get the youth.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical change does not mean that youth is near</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence of the fact that the hormone or any other chemical blamed can</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that obesity outbreak in the age of puberty may be one reason</seg>
<seg id="6">By the time is not as effective in the case of the first youth boys</seg>
<seg id="7">A former reporter of the C. N. N. pat Etherij expert journalist in the health of children and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whether the mother should be worried, if at the age of 7 or 8 years in her daughter started to the development of the breasts and genital hair go?</seg>
<seg id="9">This week at the annual conference of the Academy of American hair care in orlando, Florida's medical EndocraInologist caplovitz Dr. Paul has made clear that the initial physical change is common in American girls, reflecting the new practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Caplovitz says, "I'm very little time spent in the parents to believe it shows that it usually doesn't complete the rapid progress in the direction of the nation."</seg>
<seg id="11">The development will be visible symptoms such as the breasts Ankurit genital and kanak smell girls in the hair and physically see before that time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in the past four decades has been very little change in the age of rJodarshan (religion in the first month).</seg>
<seg id="13">United 12 per cent of the United States, the average age was 75 per year, 12 of the year in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When start to develop breasts are, at least in the first rJodarshan takes two to three years." caplovitz points out that "time before puberty in girls: The essential guide to deal with this common problem." is also the author</seg>
<seg id="15">The development of the nation is the most accurate test of time.</seg>
<seg id="16">What is the beginning of the youth, is a debate about this, but when it is two with the growth of breast development before the age of 8" pros, hair," says.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will be slow or stop quo|BAR hair can be examined by a physician, next to where I lived there.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the case of a more rapid progress in the investigation by AndocraInologist may need to tumors or cyst as the prospects of serious problems can be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the results from the previous month, religion and other treatments to increase are: The time before the age of the bones, which can be Nata in the form of undeveloped growth and adult height.</seg>
<seg id="20">SanStutiyan, the age of the child, for the treatment of drug or hormone depends on the growth rate, the growth rate, and the emotional vyskta.</seg>
<seg id="21">The psychological aspect is also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Caplovithj are conscious about the drug, but accept," the youth may increase vyvaharatmk pressing issue, and girls can feel different from his colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the other hand, can be considered a big problem: Email just don't want that to be the daughter of his age, the monthly religion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Caplovithj said, "they do worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain the cleanliness."</seg>
<seg id="25">A woman, whose daughter Mira of up to 10 years in Hinduism was started on a monthly basis, but they do," was the shock."</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were signs of this month - and we could also talk about religion, but he was not emotionally ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was dry from his school and worried about the party in her first menstrual cycle began.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are a lot of suprchlit theory about the causes of premature puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the fact that there is no evidence of any problems in milk and other food products could be accused hormone, chemicals in the environment or yaunonmukhi messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys as well as girls are trying to get the same time - a former youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">Caplovithj this rule is determined that it is the main cause of obesity outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the year 2001, he had helped to run from 6 to 9 years of study at the top of the girls, who at the time of the youth of body fat with associates.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other results do not support this conclusion, but there are also a number of other factors that contribute to it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African American and hispanics the tendency to get white girls before puberty in girls of their age.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are many explanations for this.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the global level, with a replica of the former youth at the same time, economic conditions are likely to be affected by the weather and jeans, all things.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another puzzle: Although boys are getting in the face and at the age of genital hair, but full of a function of puberty, girls are not as clear.</seg>
<seg id="38">A. A. P.; on the other doctors attending the conference in support of the jtiltaOen one|.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even that was common in babies and children can also be seen muHanse and genital hair.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Morristown nujrsi goryeb Childrens AndocraInologist hair, a physician at the hospital, Dr. Lawrence Silverman says, "we need to be careful about this is that we do not identify with the kind of the real start of the youth."</seg>
<seg id="41">The parents to take the opinion in this regard should not hesitate in taking guidance from their hair to how to talk to their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The caplovitz advised, "can be a means to the talks before the expected time."</seg>
<seg id="43">If you stay calm, your child will normally answered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time prior to the development of the girls in this daily to require that even before this time is happening, but it is a part of normal life.</seg>
