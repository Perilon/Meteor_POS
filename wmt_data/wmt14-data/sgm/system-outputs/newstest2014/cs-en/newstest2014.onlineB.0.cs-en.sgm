<seg id="1">The British government announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="2">HS2 company's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as in 2026 started the first phase.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "connects Great Britain combined."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on the plan "enthusiastic".</seg>
<seg id="5">The first phase will consist of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the completion of phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June, the government has revised the estimated cost to build a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion GBP.</seg>
<seg id="8">The British government, which held talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out more rail capacity and ability to improve travel times for the North of England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Great Britain and the city."</seg>
<seg id="11">We gave SH2 green, because the benefits that it brings is huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it, we are facing a crisis in capacity of our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connections - across the UK will be better connected thanks to HS2 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government Keith Brown Mr. Carmichael called to "unequivocally" supported the inclusion of Scottish HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds weight to the economic Scotland in the case of total high-speed railways across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So enthusiastically cooperate with the British government on exploring the possibility of bringing high speed rail to Scotland and so bring all the benefits and supplement Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government plans anyway.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, along with British ministers over the next year and the joint decisions on next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines is going to charge for carry-on luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans during their flights to charge an amount equal to 100 USD for storing hand luggage on board.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee up to $ 100 per hand luggage and 2 USD for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee for carry-on luggage involves baggage in the upper storage compartment, so little baggage under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier says it will charge 25 USD, if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 if passengers will be paying to wait until the coming of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">A company spokesman Frontier Kate O'Malley said that hundred-dollar fee is to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We do not want this fee chose," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines have started to charge for first and second checked baggage in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space, as much as she could, so in this area often lacked space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to teach passengers to get on board took less things.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really does not get more money.</seg>
<seg id="12">The point is that the most loyal customers of Frontier have clearly expressed that they find a place in the top storage compartment is increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who purchase flights on the company's website, do not pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that a passenger in line at the gate of the Frontier can bring baggage that does not pay for anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same bag will pay 100 USD.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said that the website and clearance procedures shall be designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">New Frontier fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force before the summer, but the date has not been determined yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often on fees for baggage and other fees complaining, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">He argues that the baggage handling cost money, and passengers who require this service, it would have had to pay.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street perceive additional fee for baggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most but fees for carry-on baggage did not reach.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines was the first monetization hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost airline Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only company that has also such fees, the Hungarian Wizz Air, says advisor in aviation Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.</seg>
<seg id="23">In its report of December 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage, Spirit will bring $ 50 million annually.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, former chief executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when traveling met with an unusual fees to Spirit for carry-on luggage.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Getting on the plane was the smoothest I have ever in my flying career saw," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting the gate to see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and the advent took place in an instant."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also modeled after the company's Spirit apply charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, you can keep the whole jar and free coffee will be replenished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Water will continue to be served free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">U.S. Airways in 2008, briefly tried to introduce charges for drinks, but after complaints from passengers that seven months later subsided and no other major airline nenapodobila it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Last Frontier move to charge for carry-on luggage if the passenger does not purchase the flight directly from the airline, its latest attempt to direct customers directly to your website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay Internet travel sellers such as Orbitz, 10 to 25 USD per each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">This gave impetus to all airlines that have led passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than do it through online travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier, in this field has gone away.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September started giving customers who purchased through an Internet travel agency, only half miles in a loyalty program.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday, crop it a reward for miles flown on 25 percent of the miles of paths.</seg>
<seg id="38">So the way with 1,000 miles long Frontier purchased through online travel agency means a reward of 250 million</seg>
<seg id="39">The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the company website Frontier.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has in his hometown of Denver loyal customer base, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the financial results mentioned in the middle of the corporate partner of Republic Airways Holdings revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter decreased by almost 13 percent</seg>
<seg id="42">The company is selling this Republic Airlines just trying to solve the financial problems of society Frontier.</seg>

<seg id="1">One-fifth of the shopping center is struggling with low attendance</seg>
<seg id="2">According to data from real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Prague Bohnice opens for the public Trade Centre Krakow, will be the 19th Prague shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are presently a total of 90 major business centers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unsatisfactory performance covers about 20 percent of medium and large centers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main problems are inappropriately large area to area and poor layouts, ie too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead space center, "said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, according to Head of Retail Agency at Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi is about a fifth of shopping centers struggling with low attendance.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main reasons include, among others, poor accessibility, low income category of local residents or saturation of the market at a given location.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but the results were mostly disappointing initially.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and reluctant to change their buying habits.</seg>
<seg id="11">New shopping centers must do more to 'lure' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, service and marketing, "said Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="12">Availability of shopping centers, according to Soták generally stable, even at some centers is rising because landlords were willing to compromise on the crisis in rent and dopronajmout some units.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is true that recently opened some projects that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average availability (eg Breda & Weinstein Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," he added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="14">Business centers opened in the past two years the market promoted by Sylvie Samadi very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">The market place for new projects but it exists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Number of sites suitable for construction of a successful project is very limited.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, in Prague, we see room for construction of the project, which would serve the residents of Prague 6</seg>
<seg id="18">The market is definitely room for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called 'convinience centers' aimed at daily shopping and service needs of the population living in the neighborhood, "said Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also by Sotak exists in the domestic market place for another shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="20">And as for the little 'handler' center and large projects in Prague, medium or large projects or expansion in regional cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Cities like Kladno, Czech Budejovice, Brno and Plzeň have room for further growth," he added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Prague, sees room for upcoming business center at Victory Square, as well as according to him, have a clear potential Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Intensively developing expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller cities for reasonable rent and operating costs, space is also still some areas for smaller local housing estate or shopping center, or their reconstruction such as the renovation of commercial buildings Prior which benefits from a good location, "said Dita Kubánková of DTZ.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of these shopping centers are located in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them in Prague, it is clear from the data Incoma GfK.</seg>
<seg id="27">The number of retail parks CR is below the EU average, compared with those of Britain and France, Czech lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="3">This revelation is the most eagerly awaited books sensation Campaign 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">Magazine Times acquired a copy incoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president held senior associates at the end of 2011, an intensive group meetings and surveys to estimate whether the deprivation Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the national-political correspondent for the Times Magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the elections should move former Secretary of State Clinton to post Vice President.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only a few of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, the former head of the Obama campaign, Jim Messina and former chief advisers in the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffeho - known to be considering this change.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the leader of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decide not to make this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate by "Obama's chances considerably increase ".</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I have intensively studied a variety of things and this was one of them," said Daley for the list.</seg>

<seg id="1">The black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">While American road planners are scrambling to find the money to repair crumbling highways, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that fits easily into the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">Devices that monitor every mile that a motorist travels, and which transmit this information to the authorities, are at the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the Office of State Planning to renovate outdated system of funding of U.S. Highways.</seg>
<seg id="4">Usually drab designing highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians met with groups and environmentalists lobbied for the government to be able to use these little boxes that record the mileage and maybe even where you go - and then would have used the information to build the tax base.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tea party is horrified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with privacy.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can not agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.</seg>
<seg id="9">Figuring out how the next decade may move to a system in which the driver pays per kilometer road, which we follow.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have black boxes, some of which are tracked by GPS, take the test.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is true for our nation need.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is not a matter where we can collect much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the State Administration in Southern California, for which the state plans to begin tracking mileage for every Californian motorists in 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">This changes the way we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Used to this technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">The incentive is the fact that road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at the pump is at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars will drive more miles per gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The actual federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for the past 20 years has not increased.</seg>
<seg id="19">Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by even a single cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The tax on gasoline is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test this system of payment per kilometer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In the long term it seems like the most logical alternative," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Experts call it a user fee by the number of kilometers traveled.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers, for example, which can help reduce congestion and generation of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="25">Californian designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the ambitious targets set out in the law on global warming.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said it also sees as most functional long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">Representatives from the organization of the free market Reason Foundation are also open to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's not a tax, which disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy in the organization Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People pay directly for what you get.</seg>
<seg id="30">The initiative is also supported by two former Secretaries of Transport, who in 2011 urged Congress to set out towards paying per mile.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate last year approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which was to include about 10,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="32">The management of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal, and did so because of concerns rural legislators representing the components of population whose daily life is often offend many miles out of town for work.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities but still moving forward on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ardent Oregon is that the largest experiment in the country included 5,000 drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon begin to pay state tax on mileage instead of gasoline taxes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has completed a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York just project explores.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois led the way to a limited extent, for freight wagons.</seg>
<seg id="39">A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with the coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how to implement this change.</seg>
<seg id="40">This concept does not just advocate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, which has recently been fitted with a device for about 50 cars, volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government is able to track their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about watching Big Brother type and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads management strategy and operations at the Nevada DOT.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As a pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on its website warned: "It would be very easy to turn this device into a fully fledged tracking device."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technology infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the records of daily departures and arrivals individuals.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an available technology that would enable the State to keep track of how many miles the car moves, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can, said Khan, the public will be quieter.</seg>
<seg id="48">Hon on such technology has led some state agencies to small businesses in California called True Mileage (actual distance traveled).</seg>
<seg id="49">The company initially into action to help the government taxing drivers not involved.</seg>
<seg id="50">She wanted to break into an emerging market with liability insurance cover, where drivers would pay based on how many will drive.</seg>
<seg id="51">But this device, which is trying to attract the attention of designers road network because not using GPS and adds only a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded through modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to go for it, if you do not watch their speed and their position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">In some of these pilot programs, there were many big mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="54">They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon designers are experimenting with the fact that they give drivers a choice.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or you may not take any device and instead opt to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of the country's population.</seg>
<seg id="58">In other places they hope that prudent public on this concept accede if the device will be able to more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York with transportation officials are trying to develop tax device that was fitted so that in addition to paying fees for parking meters to provide insurance by mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jam .</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of benefits offered to them," says design document of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners would like to know, however, whether all the talk about pay per mile is not just a giant placeholder problem.</seg>
<seg id="62">Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay Area say that Congress could issue bankrupt the Road Trust Fund very easily solved by increasing taxes on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="63">One-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid and other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery, when is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Law and Public Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">Doing so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">The billionaire who calls you next year?</seg>
<seg id="2">Kellner, owner of PPF group, wants to buy the operator O2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both companies confirmed the meeting and according to various sources from agencies and backstage is said to have a hand in his sleeve.</seg>
<seg id="4">Notification of transactions should still come in November, probably before the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, ie before 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kellner competitor Karel Komarek own conglomerate.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is brand Sazka Telecommunications began to auction frequencies for LTE networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">And to everyone's surprise, until the flavors to penetrate the telecommunications companies talked about.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Sazka now leads a highly experienced telecommunications trouper Robert Chvatal.</seg>
<seg id="9">He began as a marketing chief Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), and later became the director of Slovak T-Mobile recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Betting Play several cards at once.</seg>
<seg id="11">He joined the auction and now admitted that he wants to run Virtual Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the auction is successful, so do their networks will be able to move existing customers on its own virtual operator.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would probably normally not like Vodafone, but according to the information HN daily, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vodafone currently suffering agreement with competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will share their networks completely.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vodafone and partner needs.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that may be the bet.</seg>
<seg id="18">If that succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a novice may bid specially designed range) and Vodafone on the auction may not run at all, or he will not mind a limited spectrum auction (not enough frequencies for all).</seg>
<seg id="19">Vodafone is the bets on the network share.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vodafone releases a stake into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), allowing quick start enterprise networks.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sazka between starts to build expensive LTE network, which will also use Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="22">Can be satisfied both companies.</seg>
<seg id="23">Money saved by Vodafone could then spend a provider of solid internet or cable television.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Kellner?</seg>
<seg id="25">He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak Czech branch is the daughter) got immediately a full-fledged operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the other hand, it is a great juggernaut that will wait restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">The auction by LTE networks have gained Kellner for O2 and very probably in conjunction with T-Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both the company has already declared that the network will be shared.</seg>
<seg id="29">Auctions could then finally a success, but probably not enough high amounts, which enjoys state budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-mobile, Kellner or Komarek.</seg>

<seg id="6">Bashar Ditta (42) had after he became suspicious of cocaine underworld boss Neil Scarbrough transmitting sensitive information about the investigation into his activities related to drug trafficking.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and that criminals were hailed as the best legal representative, after police monitoring Scarborough, which in earlier proceedings relating to narcotics represented, in 2011, was arrested at his home.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers saw Sarborougha (32) as allowed in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just out to dinner with colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.</seg>

<seg id="10">During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, trying to surreptitiously obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were at the time observed in the major investigations of trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">Once during a series of raids police seized heroin and cocaine worth about £ 1.5 million, together with 200 000 GBP in cash, in prison with them resulted in a further 32 people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta (42) passing information to criminals fear that comes to his addiction to cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors based in Blackburn, has experienced before Liverpool Crown Court shameful moment when, after a three-week trial found guilty of that in the two cases impede the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="15">During an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lawyer's fall occurred after at Scarborough police investigation found that he was in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with the child.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives suspect watched, recorded his arrival in Dittova house and saw him put drugs with a purity of 60 percent of the lawyer's basket in black golf glove.</seg>

<seg id="21">Ditta was later arrested, but denied use of cocaine, and said he spoke with the suspected dealer because it was his client, and argued that their conversation falls into a "confidential communication".</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove her from several credit cards, but they were all arrested and had his hair samples.</seg>
<seg id="23">During police questioning he said that ran the office as your home address, workplace, and that it clients due to work issues attended at home.</seg>
<seg id="24">The court heard, however, that the key arrests contacted the major players in the drug supply chain, some of which had represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.</seg>

<seg id="34">After the hearing, however, the police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta of attorney in the criminal justice field itself became a criminal when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His cocaine addiction made ​​him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime, which gave him the task to collect valuable information about the police investigation.</seg>
<seg id="36">Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and to inspire confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta this trust betrayed and tried to hide behind the cloak of their profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Unit for serious and organized crime in Lancashire led the investigation against Mr. Ditto, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the hand of the law.</seg>

<seg id="39">During each of these weekends doctors provide various medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>

<seg id="42">Evening team is under local anesthesia simple operation.</seg>
<seg id="43">The surgery is usually done in the school building, the town hall or at home, and after surgery the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to make room for the next patient.</seg>
<seg id="44">Using light from a generator operating room and sanitary facilities Bwelle and its volunteers work in the early morning hours.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's exhausting, but musicians usually Anhui help the team to lose motivation.</seg>
<seg id="46">"To stay awake and continue to work, play drums all night," says Bwelle.</seg>

<seg id="54">It is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization that these campaigns could do.</seg>
<seg id="55">For students of medicine and nursing services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to the Bwelleovi joined on his mission, it is a great experience that would not get at home.</seg>

<seg id="3">Fay innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution solo Carolines Comedy, celebrates its tenth anniversary - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs or large theaters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played in the club," said Hirsch.</seg>
<seg id="6">This festival, we have created a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (stand up for heroes), the annual benefit musically comedic performance at Madison Square Garden, which will, among other Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>

<seg id="2">Maybe Pečinka commentator spoke so that it could agree with that, but the chairman Štěch fanned discord.</seg>

<seg id="7">On that basis, I see no better option than to propose for the Social Democrats Senate Vice Prime Minister Gajdůšková, the only handicap would not start and I think it did a standard of performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is such a good deal that barely anyone from management support.</seg>
<seg id="9">I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what you did, and continue without tearing the party.</seg>
<seg id="10">Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with just a blessing from the President of the Babis and without the Christian Democrats, but lidoveckým Health Minister Hovorka, which is actually a faithful social democrat.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government should minimenšinová great stability, as advocated by the proper law on referendum and so committed to promoting the Chairman of the Dawn Okamura.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chairman Babiš would eventually reconciled with the progression of taxes, because he is smart and sees that it does not go without it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Christian Democrats would have never presented problems because Hovorka is the bearer of the best of what they have, and the government would otherwise have been.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same is true of YES, there could be found a valuable minister, but he wisely do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also good.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's add the courage to Alena Gajdůšková!</seg>

<seg id="2">Below the statue of Samora Machel, the Mozambican president of the founder, in the heart of Maputo gathered thousands of people to the rare public demonstration chanted peace password.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want to back peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Out of fear for the future of their country exchanged business clothes for t-shirt decorated with the words "require safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="5">After two weeks came almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and the party RENAMO, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">RENAMO was once notorious rebel movements, originally supported by the white man's government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of that country.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the peace agreement in 1992 became the opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country again broke out into open conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and local.</seg>
<seg id="9">At stake is a rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can over the next few years bring for companies such as Rio Tinto and Brazil's Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko, investments worth more than $ 50 billion .</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling FRELIMO party, the dominant political force since 1975, and RENAMO blame each other from the resulting voltage.</seg>
<seg id="11">RENAMO party says the government provoked the latest conflict by 17th September launched an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold Pages RENAMO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Violent attacks on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the base side of RENAMO and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group's leader, told the Financial Times RENAMO spokesman Fernando Mazang.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames for the start of conflict RENAMO, because apparently attacked the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate fears of instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza for the French news agency AFP said Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remained of his forces in an attempt to prove that the government can order their own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">How FRELIMO and RENAMO claims that they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns grew when it was quoted words of Mazang that RENAMO party withdraws from the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">List FT said that he meant that FRELIMO party has not respect the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazang.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have made to alleviate the tension between the parties, fomenting a series of skirmishes this year, just a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's a dogfight between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them is not a good negotiator, and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">RENAMO party that sought to change the election, have indicated that they boycotted the municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted as an attempt to force the moribund movement to get government benefits and financial recovery.</seg>
<seg id="26">Electoral share RENAMO party since 1992 decreases, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the party RENAMO, as expected, its position in the elections will improve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pan Mazang says that Mr. Guebuza - which ends next year second term - he wants to destroy democracy in this country.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want a democratic multi-party system does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because they will not let the presidency," said Mazang.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what options RENAMO party has, but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and south.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is to say, several hundred kilometers away from the capital city of Maputo, but where is the city of Beira harbor, which rely on mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale at its coal exports.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended for about a week, rail use, when the party RENAMO threatened that this line of attack.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pan Mazang not want to rule on whether RENAMO repeated his threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">RENAMO wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," said Mazang.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instability increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company Mediacoop, and many people also worried about the corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne entirely by the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">A protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Nobody cares nor RENAMO or FRELIMO, just turn people want peace, they want to have free access to the road," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft manufacturers dispute the width of the seats at stake are large contract</seg>
<seg id="2">Among the leading aircraft manufacturer with the controversy erupted about the width of the seats in the second class for long haul flights, which this month gave rise bitter exchange of views at an air show in Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute is over the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one you would normally preceded by airlines, but for which the allocated space is the key to the demands of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main U.S. rival Boeing says about how to choose the airline.</seg>
<seg id="5">Controversy arose when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the biggest selling version of its twin-engine aircraft with a potential remote record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is how the back of the plane layout - especially if the adjacent 9 or 10 seats - is the basis of economic performance demands on proposals for new aircraft "mini-jumbo".</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says that the improved model "777x" transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spaced 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says that the competitive version of the model A350 delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic spaced seats after 9</seg>
<seg id="9">The giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, which is expected to 777x gain an advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently preliminarily showed what could be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers showed an image showing three people in a crowded restaurant with the caption "They let you enjoy it?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing promotes long-haul flights in the seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Sales Manager Airbus John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">How is the food ark shells, people are more, but seats on planes radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the beginning of the 70th years, the Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-distance air transport, the turn of the century, according to the Ministry of Health USA the average weight of Americans aged 40-49 years increased by 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to U.S. health statistics, the average American in the 21st century at the waist 100 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus claims its rival, the concept holds seats in the 50 years, the average width of the newly baptized seat aircraft was lower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has carried out research which suggests that extending the seats of 2.5 cm improve sleep quality by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing dimensions seat Airbus refuses and says he is not under the jurisdiction of aircraft manufacturers decide on how airlines exports fees and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Really it comes down to give airlines flexibility and allow them to do things that they believe that they must do to be successful," said the expert cab space Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not want to let them dictate what brings them profit.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers more space is essential for the elbow, but the vendor is a growing problem that can affect yields.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this dispute, the plant in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $ 700 billion at list prices, enough to tip the scales swung American and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As stated in July, Reuters, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="26">As Airbus and Boeing argues that achieved by its recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft by 20 percent better efficiency than the leader of the market in this segment model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.</seg>
<seg id="27">The performance requirements of Boeing depends in part on a comparison of the design model 777x with 10 seats in a row and the concept 777 with 9 seats in a row.</seg>
<seg id="28">Profit in unit costs compared 10sedadlovému concept weakened.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason why Boeing is doing is so crammed more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, leading to passenger comfort in the company of Airbus for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers is denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Forty-five centimeters wide seat passengers would be great, but the reality is that the business case for Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat model 777," said an expert on interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the portal Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing are not supplied seats, but offer airlines Catalogue of suppliers, so that they can choose.</seg>
<seg id="33">Scestovalí dealers aircraft even with me wearing a measuring tape to check the competitive arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offers aircraft with highly dense arrangement for low-cost airlines and regional travelers.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots a choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another creepy story about independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time it appears warning that a condition for membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="4">This gave rise to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The truth is that newspapers Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - it did not translate into newspaper headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one also mentioned that the EU Member States spend a lot of time by adapting their official acts unless it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given that Scotland is now in Schengen, offer continuing non-compliance would be to Brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the Scots really want.</seg>
<seg id="8">So it's a pretty weak story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so old that it had become obsolete. Canard that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet in this tale bearded hides an interesting idea.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should not be expected that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why replace the collar for the London Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a true European story: great postwar plan to unify Europe finally failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">The crisis of the euro is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across Europe gain influence party insiders resistance to the EU or cancellation of the euro as a common currency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany Eurosceptic party Alternativa for Germany - started this year - came out of nowhere and had a federal election in September seized nearly five million votes, making the Bundestag essentially "swept" Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).</seg>
<seg id="17">The home has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current economic crisis, however, has become a defining moment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The economy dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straightjacket inserted on the national economy through adherence to a common currency have led many people to think that the project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with high budget deficit - this was true only in the case of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks its members on exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and a German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency has southern Europe in the field of domestic production compared to Germany disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure - which encourages Germany.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of the languid performance.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not all frozen salaries in the world by stomping reversing the European petrochemical industry inexpensive slate Oil USA.</seg>
<seg id="28">The result is a simmering insurgency, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up in the world of the Washington level.</seg>
<seg id="30">Berlin but had Paris as the ID card does not need political legitimacy and enforced in Europe its own economic policy and worn French economy left to its fate.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Right wing Marine Le Pen, anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional options and postponed the ruling Socialists in third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The queue is now 24% of the vote the most popular party in France - an early warning to the British Labour Party that they can not conclude that splitting the right is automatically reflected positively on the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">As Le Pen handled his newfound popularity among working-class white man?</seg>
<seg id="34">European elections next year would like to use to cross the European Parliament created the anti-European bloc directed against the common currency.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are anti-European parties in these elections will lead well, which is likely, such a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament dominate.</seg>
<seg id="36">Me at that idea, that in the foreseeable future, a growing anti-European feeling and stance against the common currency euro together and destroy him.</seg>
<seg id="37">EU will not disappear, but rather to transform into something freer in the sense of "Europe (sovereign) nations" who prefer to General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro, but France and Southern Europe restores its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that the UK from this project will dissociate and latches on to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, increased interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">And where will Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be an area (in principle) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend its own economic interests - in the fall and the opportunity to make Berlin and Brussels, where we have to let go.</seg>
<seg id="44">I assume that Scotland would in a relaxed configuration of Europe did well, provided that it retains its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe of Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain their economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">SNP government in Scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe that won a large majority in 2011 because of opposition stance against cuts planned (and implemented) Labour chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">The parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate gender"</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize third gender in children born with ambiguous genital tract.</seg>
<seg id="3">Newborn children will no longer be ordered only either male or female gender.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law does not require parents to allow for such children reported any gender, and allows them to bring their birth certificates sex as "indeterminate" or "unspecified".</seg>
<seg id="5">The Act aims to stop pushing on parents to contact their child's hastily decided on surgery to determine the sex, and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexed.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person by the BBC for many years, said: "I am neither male nor female."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain a patchwork created by physicians, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is estimated that each year from 2000 children born to one that is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersexed, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Intersex can be Wallis Simpson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States says that you can not determine the sex, it's better to use the best available information and determine them, instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until it is done before operations, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in problems with the determination of sex, said the new German law "seems like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children it is not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sex determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait and see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">Knowledge of how a child develops gender, is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the question of why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a mystery why some people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">Report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but on their biological structure that is not exclusively or male or female, but typically consists of two and can not be clearly defined as either one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair growth, breast and body, in primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and genitals, or structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by transgender and intersex people in the work area and the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Boys not conforming to gender now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark the official documents of male, female or "third sex".</seg>
<seg id="24">Norrie May-Welby, 52letá Australian who in June became the world's first recognized "sexless" person when she won judicial appeal, that you can keep for life status "indeterminate" sex.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Ministry of the Interior will have German passports in addition to M (male) and F (female) and the third sign, X, and for intersex people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, according to news reports on France 24 issue of gender is still controversial.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strongly Catholic country signed a petition demanding that the school textbooks were removed "theory of gender".</seg>
<seg id="28">American Catholic website online is against German law also define and wrote: "With the way the world is dragged to a new situation, where sex is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, they turn upside down the other two pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One mother of a newborn Maryland also told the Baby zone that would rather see that children assigned sex at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful itself, without other limitations, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," expressed for websites related to parental care.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.</seg>
<seg id="33">A dozen years earlier, the medical community believed that sex is something like a board that can erase and redraw again.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many question the ethical basis of operations that sexual identity is a complex matter and doctors sometimes choose incorrectly, because they do not know how to respect their sex, children will feel when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century it was called the psychiatric emergency room, "said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these children were born, did you call a psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">Persisting theories about how to deal with children with ambiguous sex, was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">Created a new concept of 'sexual competence "and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment - how parents raise their child - were the children's genes and hormones and shape the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one case from 1966, known as "John / Joan", his theory became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision recommended that your child is left completely neutered, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The media presented this case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was 15 years old, got přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 38 years, committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that some doctors "this model using" today.</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 90th years, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "unhappy with the results."</seg>
<seg id="46">It was the case with Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous genital tract.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors were not sure whether a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that such a man could never live a "life satisfaction".</seg>
<seg id="48">And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed by external bodies and testes and was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">In 12 years, got female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18 he was sent on a plastic sheath.</seg>
<seg id="53">But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What they found was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">After the birth I was sterilized and nobody ever said anything.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a disorder of sex development (DSD), which prevent the body to produce enough testosterone to make the right to develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After he learned the truth, turned back to the man, took doses of testosterone and had to remove the bust,</seg>
<seg id="58">The operation caused the infertility.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today represents another in an organization called Project Interface and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexed.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice (supporters informed choice) based in California, is worried that the German Act "calls for calibration and stigmatům".</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are concerned that German law ensures that encourages parents to do a quick decision and choice for baby, vague, '" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid that it prompts for intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We believe that it is better to assign male or female, and then wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we do not know how the law eventually confesses so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattisová said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included into the third sex".</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make a legally valid decision of their own sex," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is going to assign it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is a battle we would at this point not to seduce a young child.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, they may by your own body to make its own decisions.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratzová, radioložka chest of Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law, "grant powers" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratzové daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because the androgen receptors are defective, we developed Katie feminine features.</seg>
<seg id="73">My vagina, but not the uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now the 29 year old Katie married in studies at the University of Pennsylvania, working as an intern at a children's psychiatric ward.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although barren, hopes to become parents through adoption or surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents a space to make its decision in no hurry," said Baratzová.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them time to make some tests and change your mind and gives them time to write "male" or "female".</seg>
<seg id="78">In this respect, everything is fine - you raise your child and you love it.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful child and rejoice in it.</seg>
<seg id="80">You do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the opportunity to participate in decision-making and child and takes away the anxiety that binds parents, because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Finally, the child decide with which sex is more endorses - and this is a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It gives children the power to make their own decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Karel Drabek: Uhlířský Hill - one of the youngest volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="2">Uhlířský Hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntálu.</seg>
<seg id="3">Along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in the low Jeseníku at a time (in geological terms) recently.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last eruption here was still at the beginning of the Quaternary.</seg>
<seg id="5">When viewed from a distance is at the top of the hill Uhlířského striking whitewashed Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Succour, built between 1755 -, 1765.</seg>
<seg id="6">It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inn, which stood next to the church is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the completion of the church was planted avenue of four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long.</seg>
<seg id="9">Way of the Cross on the hill Uhlířský is the third version of the original stood here after 1916, the second from 2001 lasted only until 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fifteen stops are wooden sculptures, made by local woodcarver František Nedomlel.</seg>
<seg id="11">He used different kinds of trees from an area of ​​low Jeseníku.</seg>
<seg id="12">Similarly, the base of the rocks from the local areas are interesting geological exposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">At each stop is given the name of the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="14">Uhlířský top of the rest of the young volcano.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the data from radiometric age measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus Volcano (age 0.8 million years).</seg>
<seg id="17">The volcano was born explosion.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it vomited large amounts of volcanic ash along with rock debris on the ground that burning a red-brown color.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of this phase spilled on the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second eruption ejected red, reddish brown and sometimes almost black tuffs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their coat is mighty to 50 meters and the area is accessible in the wall of the quarry.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the tuffs are striking volcanic bombs as large as 1 meter. I second eruption ended with an outpouring of lava.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the conclusion of the activity of the volcano spilled lava, which now accounts for up to 50 m thick layer of slag basalt.</seg>
<seg id="24">Volcanoes, which alternates with volcanic ash spew lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because they are actually composed of layers was named stratovolcano.</seg>
<seg id="26">Original volcanic cone subject to gradual erosion.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the danger to the mining of rocks in a quarry on the south side.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.</seg>
<seg id="29">Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and have better thermal insulation properties.</seg>
<seg id="30">The mining is managed under the pressure of professionals and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problem, however, is the lack of consistency and porosity of rocks that quickly erode, disintegrate and sesouvají down the slope.</seg>
<seg id="32">Lom and relatively fast disappearing.</seg>
<seg id="33">To make matters even more complicated is warm, south-facing slopes ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.</seg>
<seg id="34">The correction is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a distinctive geological profile.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.</seg>
<seg id="36">On top Uhlířský you get the green trail from Bruntálu, or from the Silesian Kočová.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis 22nd February first appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cardinals are in the clergy of the Catholic Church's highest position next to the pope and those who elect the Pope, so František appoints its first group of men who ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once the Cardinal reached the age of 80 years, who can not participate in the election of the Pope - the group is reduced to 120 and opting for the Cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, Vatican spokesman, said that before the promotion ceremony of the new cardinals will be held assemblies current cardinals known as konzistorium.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene February konzistorium advance to facilitate planning other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world," said Lombardi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices sheet said that the number of voters Cardinals to February is likely to fall.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the Pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary, to the number of electors rose again to 120, and many cardinals over age 80 years, how much he wants.</seg>
<seg id="10">Konzistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was in March this year elected, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this moment shows a certain focus on Europe, Europe and especially Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new cardinals Pope nominates the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will also be the first choice of the Cardinals since Francis appointed as the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who had the task of finding ways to reform the Church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that the cardinals Pope asks for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this situation, but we were not before - it is absolutely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that the popes traditionally lifted up to the position of cardinal bishops of the big points, but Frank is "full of surprises - so we do not know who to designate."</seg>

<seg id="5">Israelis showed exactly how to look bombing Syria.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without undue hype, threats and millions statement sent planes, you hit the target and returned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without leaving lulled official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="8">The whole event will refuse to acknowledge it and to not express it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact opposite is confused and grandiloquent, actions unsupported Obama's Syria policy.</seg>
<seg id="10">A most satisfactory throughout the attack was what the Israelis bombed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Do not be fooled by the media claims that the bombing "Syrian base" or "supplies to Hezbollah."</seg>
<seg id="12">Recently, I wrote here that while U.S. aid to the secular insurgents remain in the country only on the rhetorical level, so merrily on Russia supplies arms to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">A very fresh supply Russian rockets landed in the port Latákija become the target of the Israeli raid.</seg>
<seg id="14">Clear message.</seg>
<seg id="15">A Notice of Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it's popular Internet theory should be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. government has distinguished two members spaciálních units, probably Delta Force.</seg>
<seg id="17">He did not know until now that distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is known heroic death of two former members of the SEALs, who defended the CIA campus in the city, I think they were members of a secret CIA squads, which is made up of former soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has long been speculated they did SEALs from the consulate or even residence located elsewhere in the CIA.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now it's clearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected machine-gun nests (just one that both members of the SEALs killed after being hit mortar) is quite surprising.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were part of the U.S. commandos in Tripoli, and soon received word of the attack in Benghazi volunteered to intervention and, together with five private contractors a way into the CIA campus in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obama administration disgrace the fact that during that attack, it was not officially squad deployed a whole, and that is simply reluctant to do.</seg>
<seg id="25">Commander Commando and apparently without orders release these volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Anyway, that operates in a country not once, but constantly American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.</seg>
<seg id="27">And due to the fact that until recently no such thing officially denied it even now talks about some sort of counseling NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is good that the USA even if half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although the national situation to resolve it wanted to help much more.</seg>
<seg id="30">The last secret place a permanent conflict, which today I want to write the coast of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not so long ago, the media almost spoke of the Iranian Air Force for prosecution of U.S. drones.</seg>
<seg id="32">Little is known, however, how the Americans effectively protect their drones.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course, if you happen to manage to discover its drone airspace, not to do anything with it.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, if the Iranians discovered drone in the international area, the situation is quite different.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so it was that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom chased American drone in international space above the sea, which was perhaps the first deployment of American super sharp fighter F-22 Raptor in history.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Phantom podletěl to visually verify the equipment without being registered on the radar Phantom or you just noticed and then he suddenly appeared to him and urged Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without a murmur.</seg>
<seg id="37">No wonder, when the airplane Phantom of American manufacturing, but remember the war in Vietnam.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tipsport How (not) deleted personal information.</seg>
<seg id="2">Over a year ago, I registered the site Tipsport.cz.</seg>
<seg id="3">Then I followed but did not finish because it was sitting on a branch someone from the internet registration could not be completed.</seg>
<seg id="4">And because I did not want to go to another branch registration failed, then I moved and because I changed address and identity card number.</seg>
<seg id="5">When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is impossible because I have another OP number, address, and it just is not complete and that I should ask for the deletion of data and re-registration.</seg>
<seg id="6">So I did, and October 24, 2013, I wrote to tech support to ask for the deletion of their personal data from the database according to the law on protection of personal data.</seg>
<seg id="7">On that day she wrote me a rainbow technical support that I have to complete the registration at any branch.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus began a marathon e-mail technical support, where finally the fourth urganci 25.10. wrote that personal information deleted at my request.</seg>
<seg id="9">One could therefore say that could make one new registration and here again the problems began soon I wrote that my username is already taken (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal information, but in the end i knocked this).</seg>
<seg id="10">So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal information already stored, to finish the registration at the branch (as may have saved something claiming to erase?), So I contacted tech support again.</seg>
<seg id="11">My question is how can I write back to that personal data is actually deleted 25.10. and I sent an e-mail with that error.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what I did (yesterday around the 15th hour) and write back to me today that I have registered the same day (31 October 2013) at 13.22, and that therefore it is impossible because I used the same name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="13">What does it matter that I contact technical support for a week already and I deal with them, it still does not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">And what about the fact that if it were true assertions (As is) could not register one with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just by the way, those 13.22 I actually registered to the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and telephone number and lo and behold, there was my page that my e-mail was sent a link to complete registration.</seg>
<seg id="16">But how is this possible when you can not register the same name and date of birth?</seg>
<seg id="17">Probably because Tipsport binds to the registration e-mail and phone number and data simply has not surrendered as he claims.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I again told the technical support that simply lying (either intentionally or not know what to write), because what they write is not true.</seg>
<seg id="19">Substantiate some screenshots I think the problem with the registration had been before 31.10. so "fake" registration for this is simply not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="20">On it I wrote Tipsport curt sentence - I'm sorry, but that you've re-registered, we can investigate your claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">A communication ended.</seg>
<seg id="22">Or repeats the same phrase over and over, that binds to the registration name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="23">They can not accept the fact that registration has not been completed, click on that link in the e-mail and so not really taken place.</seg>
<seg id="24">To sum up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but even lying when he says the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="25">O's worse is that it can easily prove to lie and try to make it appear that the error is on the client side.</seg>
<seg id="26">Anyway, after putting the issue on my personal blog to give things a bit in motion and technical support e-mail came that the matter be transmitted to verification and will be informed (after a week of haggling and reminders and warnings to make the same mistake).</seg>

<seg id="2">British businessman made ​​the first ice cream that glows in the dark - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of marine animal and developed a fluorescent treat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea came when he read scientific essay on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produced a protein that causes fluorescence.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes the radiation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says that ice is lit when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more the league, the more of September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious" (lick me, taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so for 200 GBP will get about 2 g of the substance. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein, which we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So how hot your mouth protein, increases the pH level and the ice begins to shine.</seg>
<seg id="10">We tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for a Halloween celebration, because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made​​, because jellyfish fluorescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So me each scoop is about 140 GBP.</seg>

<seg id="16">He says: "I really wanted to make an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">In essence, it is impossible due to refraction of light caused by ice crystals that form ice, but I reckon with the fact that for some way to do it, find it.</seg>

<seg id="2">October elections rather than winner brought a bunch of losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's not just the parties engaged in the Chamber of Deputies or not received (eg SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the Social Democrats because of their internal schism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Politicians us instead of beef served a festive weekend election stew.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jumper of elections became the movement Andrej Babis, who promised voters to change the existing political style of governance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fragmentation of the election results, and the split in the winning side of the political records (z) the will of President Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters which party they Zeman president publicly supported or not chosen in the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the president has lost because of unpleasant events strategic edge over other policies, but left him a few more ways to get it back - for example, selecting a future prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the Social Democrats, the chances of getting the prime minister in my eyes recede, entrepreneur Andrej Babis closer to the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Post-election developments, although still far removed from the smooth and speedy formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario leftist Social Democrats supported the Communist government is the development of business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy was better news.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to vocal opposition YES to get together with ODS and TOP 09 is still the most likely alternative coalition Social Democrats, YES and KDU-CSL (a total of 111 deputies).</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the split in the Social Democrats, who thus became unreadable and weak parterre at negotiations may be the result of coalition negotiations daunting enough for the party.</seg>
<seg id="12">The minority government consisting of the Social Democrats' nezemanovců "at the Castle probably will not pass.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, any government, to which the CSSD will participate, will be compromised unmet ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">I ask myself, "Nespějeme gravity to other early elections?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Another option would have been rather a referendum on the strength of voter mandate YES movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">CSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a stronger increase in income taxes or state bank building fell under the table hopefully.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pages CSSD, yes, KDU-CSL and the dawn on the other hand the same example to support entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP) to promote employment for disadvantaged people, reduce the lower rate of VAT on selected goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friction surfaces are most frequently found in the perspective of social policy and the size of the state.</seg>
<seg id="19">YES has the upper hand now, but so far the most likely coalition program YES, CSSD, KDU-CSL would be leaning more to the right.</seg>
<seg id="20">Which in my view is ultimately better than left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists more light on how the tail movements related to the dog's mood</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wagging tail to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while nervous dogs tail waving mostly to the left.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail to record a response.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "With men it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different binding to the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">The same thing we tried to be observed in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that, as is the case in humans and dogs the right side of the brain responsible for the left-hand movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to get more information about how dogs respond to asymmetrical tail wagging of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals watched movies about other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes goes their tail to one side, and sometimes on the other.</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said, "we projected dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of silhouettes - to get rid of any confounding stimuli, and we are also able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw otherwise lackluster dog move his tail to the right (from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail) remained completely calm.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when he saw the shooting tail largely left (again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), their heart rate increased and the animals she was unsure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Vallortigara said he does not think that dogs through these movements consciously communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rather, it believes that the dogs have learned from experience, that the movement must and you need not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you meet several dogs and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior, you respond to this experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers say the findings may dog owners, veterinarians and cvičitelům help better understand the emotions of their animals.</seg>
<seg id="17">An expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, a high school teacher veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side for dogs is important.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned away his head to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and right when looking at the cheerful dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">A specialist in another paper by the University of Victoria in Canada said: "The dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when the tail wagging the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite compared to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">The difference may be due to him that the dogs in the different studies animals in movies or dog robots landings quite like dogs.</seg>
<seg id="21">He explained that it could help the study of how dogs react to real dogs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Although in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">But given how easy it is to record their behavior, probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes their tail goes one way and sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="10">"But the desire to show everyone he's still in me," reports the determination.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maybe we will see, it is supposedly the New York Rangers, who failed to enter into the season and they have injured two pillars - the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.</seg>
<seg id="12">How did you came to the Rangers look like?</seg>
<seg id="13">It's just speculation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until I have something on paper, so it is not worth to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know that there was an article in the New York Post, that I should sign, but that's all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was never delivered, that this really happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, myself, would like to announce that I have a contract, but it just is not so.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not you heard nothing from the club?</seg>
<seg id="19">Such communication takes place every day in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="20">There goes about getting into a situation where the contract really matter.</seg>
<seg id="21">When a player to be injured or to someone not a mančaft struggling.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are many different factors that must meet together to get the contract.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in New York, just like circumstances occur, right?</seg>
<seg id="24">Injury is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team came out entry into the season, so there is some chance, do not you think?</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, the chance is always.</seg>
<seg id="26">The second thing is that we always need two sides.</seg>
<seg id="27">I would today take a lot of offers, but so far I did not get one.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is unfortunately the reality in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Friday I'm off to America, you're in the expectation that something can all work out after all?</seg>

<seg id="47">I had a job that was the most beautiful thing to me except my family could meet.</seg>
<seg id="48">You had plenty of offers from Europe: you have it, you want to play NHL just because it's NHL or is it because of the family you want to be in America?</seg>
<seg id="49">Since I'm a hockey player, so the first place - in addition to the family - includes sporting success.</seg>
<seg id="50">NHL is the best competition in the world.</seg>
<seg id="51">And since it also affects family life.</seg>
<seg id="52">My children, then pardon our children - mine and my wife's - grew up in the States, there began to go to school and so on.</seg>
<seg id="53">And we would be very happy if in this trend continued.</seg>
<seg id="54">Because what do we delude ourselves in America are opportunities somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="55">Such a chance would they have to offer.</seg>
<seg id="56">So you are planning to stay in America permanently?</seg>

<seg id="62">You could say that I went in front of him, it took a lot of strength and sacrifice and took me a lot of things that I missed.</seg>

<seg id="67">Yeah, that's a question you can not answer.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, I still got inside, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, I'm still better than anyone else.</seg>

<seg id="11">I'm getting over it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sometimes I feel like my life on this planet is burning brain.</seg>
<seg id="13">I prefer to go for a walk and then a night lamp for reading books.</seg>
<seg id="14">You talk about frustration, hatred.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was somewhere in the past a turning point that influenced you, or maybe just getting old, as we all?</seg>
<seg id="16">The turning point came a long time ago, in about ten years.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that time it did not name.</seg>
<seg id="18">Well, after that I lived.</seg>
<seg id="19">Somewhere inside is surprised but still quiet boy.</seg>
<seg id="20">I see another lone cvikýře, each in its tornado anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="21">It saved me writing books.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am participating in this gigantic, thousands of years of the movement of life on this planet - the birth of the future elusive.</seg>
<seg id="23">That vast, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of the present.</seg>
<seg id="24">We're players sad and beautiful games ever through trial-and-error arises more and more generations of beings that trillions of interactions per second creates a superhuman artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="25">Twelve years is a relatively long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="27">Monologue, or rather a dialogue that leads right and left half of the brain, sometimes putting to the surface and forms in the book.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the era of peace interwoven quietly sleeping metastases wars that might wake up one day - so the book has twelve years of silence dressed in words.</seg>
<seg id="29">I felt my silent avalanche life growing in the brain, and if you do nothing, so one day I quietly caving.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's a set of questions formulated by the brain and is considered layers that are deposited in the Dark "below the surface of consciousness."</seg>
<seg id="31">The neocortex, gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary units, it is an ancient grain in the brain tree.</seg>
<seg id="32">He speaks to srstnatým beasts, snakes asks, looking for the answer in the flight of birds, raised his eyes to the clouds in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yes, the moral law within me, the starry sky above me.</seg>
<seg id="34">Finally, the brain asks world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Relatively often express it metaphorically to the ego - could you define it biologically?</seg>
<seg id="36">The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has lived.</seg>
<seg id="37">This forest logically and emotionally exposed to a branching tree of information registers memory used by the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to ever-changing presence in the continuous effort in trying to identify and understand their surroundings and decode important messages.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes faults occur from overload.</seg>
<seg id="39">Analogy - as if they "fell" PC, from the vocal emulator and interpreter of foreign languages ​​would you initially entangled in the operating environment such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts finished with dark green flickering screen bios, the base system, which controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard between the CPU and RAM, etc.</seg>
<seg id="40">For those who still did not understand what they are talking - talking about spiritual crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">You refer to it often - why does not this type of regression regularly cares?</seg>
<seg id="42">Because it is a pit.</seg>
<seg id="43">In hitherto functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - appears gap.</seg>
<seg id="44">Here is a good quote from Nietzsche: "As long staring into the abyss, the abyss looked up to him."</seg>
<seg id="45">Pure feeling - that man is lost when all hope disappears, mentally "dies" and started a new quality.</seg>
<seg id="46">And why do I care personally?</seg>
<seg id="47">Answer with a parable.</seg>
<seg id="48">Once one fell into a pool and drowning, running days, months and years, he still drowning while reading, and the books had taught him to swim - that is to live.</seg>
<seg id="49">He became a "diver".</seg>
<seg id="50">Perhaps someone will help me a written sentence, as once helped me Hrabal's texts.</seg>
<seg id="51">To what extent do you think the reader to a specific person who will read your text?</seg>
<seg id="52">One of which is not to say anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I believe it best to characterize Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:</seg>
<seg id="53">"I is someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."</seg>
<seg id="54">From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in a submarine of Captain Nemo, Stínadlech running around in dark alleys.</seg>
<seg id="55">Just then, behind this branching authors and their message is: "The sun clear of other worlds Karel Hynek Macha."</seg>
<seg id="56">And when the book is out there?</seg>
<seg id="57">It depends on the reader's opinion?</seg>
<seg id="58">The repercussions that to you through the people who read the book, get it?</seg>
<seg id="59">Of course I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns, and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.</seg>
<seg id="60">And then me, even after years on the street randomly contacted and thank me that I had his book helped them in some difficult life decisions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Books are actually "lives" or rather "worlds".</seg>
<seg id="62">They are encoded in the character letters carry the experience, the history of the region that language.</seg>
<seg id="63">Whenever we wake up to a life sentence if we let them flow to the brain.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - waking up more and more stories of life, the universe and temporary small planet.</seg>
<seg id="65">It's a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to the old books démonologických to commit witchcraft.</seg>
<seg id="66">After the publication of the book you - as usual - waiting chain readings.</seg>
<seg id="67">I remember reading once that you like.</seg>
<seg id="68">Vrhneš into it again with joy, or do you feel after years otherwise?</seg>

<seg id="71">Wherever they live good intelligent people.</seg>
<seg id="72">Their basic character - are stealthy, too does not purport to themselves, have a friendly Radiation, do not feel lonely with them.</seg>
<seg id="73">I'll give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived was (and I hope he's still alive) one curly bookseller (called aptly Robin), a cheerful companion and good girls bull.</seg>

<seg id="75">I looked them in the eye and then I was shown the ragged, octene copy of my book.</seg>
<seg id="76">Embarrassed, I just put the reading position sausage and shortly masculine wept.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ostrava Mayor Kajnar Cancer in the CSSD is not me</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the election was fully ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava CSSD.</seg>
<seg id="3">All this culminated when the mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar go to court because of the undemocratic assembly candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Actors cases to it still did not want to speak too, that the parties before the elections even more damage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now they are the voices of voters numbered.</seg>
<seg id="6">Keeping in Ostrava and the Social Democrats on Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava to secede from the side, and will probably push on it to come on their function.</seg>
<seg id="7">Petr Kajnar but wants to keep fighting.</seg>
<seg id="8">What goes in disputes and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview with the Journal.</seg>
<seg id="9">How do you feel about the outcome of elections?</seg>
<seg id="10">CSSD certainly allowed for a much better result.</seg>
<seg id="11">Harm her with us to the address before the elections in the media disputes within the party?</seg>
<seg id="12">I imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a party which has its own internal problems, is intrinsically ill and people perceive that it is not all right.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the elections to make it clear.</seg>
<seg id="16">What are the internal medicine CSSD?</seg>
<seg id="17">Decline for some time passes me by ODS and things like that now, unfortunately taking place in social democracy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Is it that lobbyists influential people who previously had expected that their benefices find at ODS, moved to the people in the CSSD and have an impact.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is related to the fact that the offices of the Municipality of Ostrava police come and collect your computer.</seg>
<seg id="20">It shows that the CSSD is not made up only of people who would like the benefit of others, but many of them are thinking of the good of his own.</seg>
<seg id="21">CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps and Prague, as seen in the current power struggle between Haskovec and Sobotkovci.</seg>
<seg id="22">I have to be prepared but long.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's what happened before the elections in Ostrava, was a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hašek wing gradually occupied a position to then after the election could cause a situation that weakens Sobotka wing.</seg>
<seg id="25">People in politics in a situation where sometimes have to compromise.</seg>
<seg id="26">Everyone has an inner boundary but when it compromises you do not go, and that's my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Originally I did not want to stand in the House, but when I perceived the whole thing within the party, so I made ​​a deal with Lubos Zaorálek I'll try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen as mayor of Ostrava Sobotka right wing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Hašek wing but it could stop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hasek?</seg>
<seg id="30">Mussels Sobotka to me is a man who always speaks primarily about the CSSD and to some extent for the vision for the party and for the country.</seg>
<seg id="31">I admit that the other side heard anything like that.</seg>
<seg id="32">Michal Hašek just fighting for power.</seg>
<seg id="33">I do not understand how the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the executive committee, just start undoing the party chairman.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a struggle for power no matter what, and against the statutes party.</seg>
<seg id="35">I think what we now Michal Hašek performed in Prague, he ended his political career.</seg>
<seg id="36">How did you perceive that you Ostrava CSSD leadership to the candidate did not approve.</seg>
<seg id="37">Political parties are based on the competition, who are both members of their places.</seg>
<seg id="38">The competition should be largely based on program vision and the ability of the people to fulfill the vision.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, however, this Voice of the people who power or ability to have a vision, but the party is for them a lift to the money you would get elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="40">The problem is when these people start to the fore because unscrupulous infringers violate the statutes of the party.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their practices make the political parties and the Mafia by me and also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Alert on this issue is more important to me than to take account of whether a Kajnar has a political future.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important that the parties began to respect the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Therefore, you are then brought before the election proposal to the court for an injunction against the form of the ballot CSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?</seg>
<seg id="45">The current county executive committee CSSD in Ostrava consolidate his power by organizations that do not fit, he can cancel the new purpose-based organization, gradually throws party members uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="46">Example of this is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik of the club representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then resolution to exclude rather canceled.</seg>
<seg id="47">This shows that claim adherence to the parties before the court, although the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD stopped working, it's the only option.</seg>
<seg id="48">The management of the Ostrava Social Democrats, headed by deputy Adam Rykala is revoked you from the position of Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is an open secret that this post has a crush mayor Poruby Lumír Palyza.</seg>
<seg id="50">That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza trying to do everything so that I could appeal.</seg>
<seg id="51">They promise to rank people, get votes and then the voices strengthen their power in the party.</seg>
<seg id="52">When you return to the past and everything that happened to be around the football club Banik Ostrava stadium and purchase Bazaly was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was artificially staged to me could be described as a person who gives money where it does not belong.</seg>
<seg id="54">In doing so, the city bought the property to him strategically a great value.</seg>
<seg id="55">How do you see it move on with their remaining as mayor?</seg>
<seg id="56">The district committee had me and another on Monday urged people to consider whether to remain in the CSSD.</seg>
<seg id="57">But I think that it's as if the thief shouting: To Catch a Thief!</seg>
<seg id="58">Looking at the results of my work for the last eleven years, so I do not see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and enforced, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developing things like industrial zones or expansion of scientific-technological park.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite all this I become uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="60">I do not read it differently than that You interfere with others, came to the place they desire.</seg>
<seg id="61">We will therefore these efforts still somehow fight?</seg>
<seg id="62">Since when has this republic to function well, it must work well on political parties.</seg>
<seg id="63">I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state, he can not drive or herself.</seg>
<seg id="64">I do not speculate, therefore, that I now retired from the Social Democrats, because I think that whoever causes cancer this side, not me, but these people who are trying to vyštvat me.</seg>

<seg id="1">Defend academic freedom, this is true for Zemana and ODS.</seg>
<seg id="2">I have repeatedly in recent months called an open letter to students, educators, and management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend the academic freedom of the electoral campaign, conducted by the school president Miloš Zeman.</seg>
<seg id="3">I met with more or less success.</seg>

<seg id="7">The newly elected MP for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic positions and, moreover, he seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sir, this really is not the same as if you stayed example, the mayor of a small city.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to be the captains of the Social Democrats, who vykovávají capacity as a deputy governor and as they degrade both professions?</seg>
<seg id="10">This is telling people that they can handle both of these features challenging left back.</seg>
<seg id="11">I know we have an example of Michal Hašek, who even manages dozens of features at once.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this probably is not the example of a person that you should follow.</seg>
<seg id="13">We find the opposite and positive example MD. Štěpánky Frank, who prefer to leave the deputy's post to be able to fully concentrate on the management of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="14">The main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of Dean, however, is that the dual functions violate apolitical campuses of the University of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leadership in Pardubice ODS sees your current action at both positions as a benefit for the University.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Their" school, however, you will be able to help without even staying dean.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think a similar view as mine and rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Commission heard that before lawsuits against Jonathan Lord two employees were accused young men Christian Association (YMCA)</seg>
<seg id="2">Royal Commission on the sexual abuse of children learned that before the accusations against the child educators Jonathan Lord from the city Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Young Men Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.</seg>
<seg id="3">But before the commission was said that in his opening statement to the association stated that your organization has ever resolved the case of sexual abuse of a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case when one of the employees of the YMCA accused of offenses relating to child pornography, and on the other, the gym teacher at the YMCA Caringbah in 1991 was convicted of sexual abuse of children which he had in his care .</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, advisor committee that he knew about the first case, but the second is not.</seg>
<seg id="6">He admitted that the opening statement, the YMCA was also inaccurate when announcing that the YMCA is conducted external audits, which valued the organization as a leading advocate of children's rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the Commission talks about the YMCA was advised that the audit of the Ministry of Education and the Office of August this year, received the second lowest of four possible ratings.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Hare, who began working with the Association of YMCA when he was 21, he admitted that the leadership itself from him down failed when Mr. Lord has taken, without making sure that your staff is aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year, the Lord convicted for sexual harassment 12 boys committed during the two years when he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Hare but rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff to report security breaches children, Mr. Lord.</seg>
<seg id="12">Members of staff gave evidence that they were witnessing such breach, including that the Lord was with the children alone, privately guarded them, let them sit with me on his lap, he said to them that he loves them, and let them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwellová, which was subordinate to the lord and asked for training children's safety because she worried about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barn, head of services to children in the YMCA in Caringbah, which was Lordovým supervisor was "very intimidating and often was difficult to talk to him about something. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Director General said that the evidence does not accept the staff that make you feel uncomfortable if they had contacted his superiors and deeds report.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, and therefore did not report the problem.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the Board of the YMCA in New South Wales said its view that the lessons of the "case of Jonathan Lord" for the organization lies in the fact that the staff "did not have a message," a council with him as agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after an allegation made ​​general manager for services to children in the YMCA Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said that the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence, but was "overly zealous" and poorly made.</seg>
<seg id="19">An expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not in the years 2009-2011 the organization that would be safe for children.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said that there will be serious problems in recruiting, screening, implementation, training and management of personnel.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use in aircraft technology gains (but not make calls from their mobile phones)</seg>
<seg id="2">The passengers of the airlines will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - except calls from their mobile phone - reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules on Thursday issued a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA ).</seg>
<seg id="3">Passengers but do not expect changes occur immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly will the change will be introduced by different airlines, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will be required to manage FAA to demonstrate how their aircraft comply with the new rules and updated training manuals for cabin crew and guidelines for storage facilities in order to comply with the new rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">FAA stated that since some airlines received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Among the companies that have sent the plans are Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of such a plan can improve widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, the passenger is required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">They can not be turned on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 km and the captain issued the permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane drops to land, and do not turn them until the aircraft is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new rules, the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference, allowing its passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, said FAA.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers could use the Wifi at higher altitudes, it is expected that meets these criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Gladingová, president of the Association of Professional stewards, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new rules introduced safely - and we stand with transport companies we work closely - it will be a success," she said in a statement Gladingová.</seg>
<seg id="16">Have us frankly tired look as "watchdogs".</seg>
<seg id="17">However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will remain below 3 km altitude prohibited, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be advised that their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched to air mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So still no Words with friends, online scrabble type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off your device when the aircraft was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">A heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that could hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Calls from mobile phones will remain on board prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify FAA, but the U.S. Federal Bureau of Telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may in some electronic devices during takeoff and landing lift the ban.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month Mark Rosenker of the National Committee for Transportation Safety, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because it can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but data from the FCC, we also know that the air can cause interference to broadcast towers," said Rosenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">A business advisory committee created by the administration of FAA therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">The FAA has in recent years been pressured to ease the restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics like Senator Claire McCaskillová, Democrat of Missouri, said that there is no valid security reason for this ban.</seg>
<seg id="29">Restrictions have also become more difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers may forget to turn off their devices duty or ignores it.</seg>
<seg id="31">FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of the navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry a FM radio, a technical achievement at that time.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems of aircraft than previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic jamming.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines for several years, offering passengers using Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="34">Plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airlines would be under the new rules should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices, said Huerta.</seg>
<seg id="36">Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting, than it was for previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">For example, the electronic reader issue when turning pages only minimal transmission.</seg>
<seg id="38">But broadcasting is stronger when the machine download or upload data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pushing for it to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, representatives of the company loaded airliner with its Kindle electronic reader and perform a test flight, but no problem reappeared.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the Advisory Committee FAA expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose a risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of airline passengers said he is confident that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of these reports is very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots ordered the passengers off the device during instrument flying in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Group tourism industry has welcomed these changes and goes by her sensible approach to the traveling public that the technology used in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="3">The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama responsible for that, with regard to the incendiary revelations about the NSA spying, which emerged from the informant Edward Snowden, acted as the "autopilot".</seg>
<seg id="4">The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Kerry via video-link on open government conference in London said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government we actually learned about some of the things that the inertia guns, because there was the possibility, with reference the Second World war, the difficult period of the Cold War and of course the 11th of September.

<seg id="15">The chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreign countries relating to alleged U.S. spying and convince Europeans that they should continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut said this week he spoke with members of the European Parliament and of the others and that he worried about the threat to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they are disillusioned by monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).</seg>
<seg id="17">For national security interests of the USA is really important to us that Europe remains the same boat, with regard to the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and President of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs .</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe, I made ​​it clear that we need to continue cooperation in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, even though the agency head said this week that were inaccurate and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and shared with the United States,</seg>
<seg id="20">Further disclosure documents cited betrayed Snowden, the NSA monitored the mobile phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders to 34.</seg>
<seg id="21">Director of National Intelligence James Clapper espionage allies defended as necessary and said that it is on both sides of ordinary matter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the turmoil Murphy said his office plans to parliamentary journey that should take place this year, and hopes that the delegation will be members of both parties and chambers.</seg>

<seg id="24">He said that the program is still running.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to help correct relations, adding that they are ready and "well-intentioned educational measures."</seg>
<seg id="26">He said that European leaders need to be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that benefit themselves over the years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we adjust their monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize the fact that we're not the only one who's spying," said Murphy.</seg>

<seg id="6">Package of $ 325 million includes $ 31 million for operations at the request of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another 2,600 operations including orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery will help eliminate debt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Money is also open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="9">Mother and daughter had moved from stodvacetimetrového apartment into a smaller flat 62 m2, and almost all the facilities were handed out.</seg>
<seg id="10">Action was not easy, things were stored at a friend gradual arranging lasted almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new apartment was in pretty good condition, but had done the necessary adjustments, such as painting a door or window replacement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous owner crashed kernel, but owner mattered most impractical solutions and unnecessarily large hall, small bathroom, and vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="31">We managed to uniquely separate sleeping and living areas.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was enough to turn itself back two sofas and between them build a custom-made box on duvets.</seg>
<seg id="33">Dining area defined by shades of flooring and painting.</seg>

<seg id="7">Then, when the show Helena and her boys embroider chain stitch festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.</seg>
<seg id="8">And only then after several warnings finally wash the dishes, vacuum, winter nanosit wood to tile stoves and tasks to do after dark under a lamp (or rely on a classmate tasks instead of writing love poems addressed to school sweethearts).</seg>
<seg id="9">Morning breakfast homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the sort of jams that are sold now, in addition to the content of strawberries or not lying) and drink a tea made from dried herbs that we so love my mom picked.</seg>
<seg id="10">I also recall those magical evenings when it was a deathly silence in the closet when we are sister taped songs off the radio on cassettes, which revolved loudly in the old tape recorder for my mom.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then we had to stick the tape rewinding and spending the same one over and over song, our favorite plus a toasted trap.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied together with string - and while you're at it calls us to be better heard, it was necessary to thoroughly clean the ears, then uchošťour the width + cotton.</seg>
<seg id="13">The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it so that we lack nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">We did not need you any iPhone, iPad or even mobile phones and laptops or designer clothes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Clothing was handed down from generation to generation and the best "increment" in the closet was home-made tie-dyed T-shirt using SAVA.</seg>
<seg id="16">The electronics we managed to the satisfaction of the said mom's cassette player and make the most Walkman, which we have shared with my sister and we just casually used the same train on a school trip.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seemed to us interesting to play with my aunt Kloboučku Hop or Ludo or, as I have said to go "just" out.</seg>
<seg id="18">When I was a little older we got for Christmas video player, sure to conserve his parents for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up with us for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">My younger sister to him narwhal strudel, apparently so beautifully papal those tapes and tried if SPAP and strudel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately spapal, but it was his last bite.</seg>
<seg id="21">Well, this story still has, poor thing, on a plate from my dad all the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">She says that when she was little Lenka, narwhal strudel into the video and thought that it plays a recipe not to play, so it still can not bake.</seg>
<seg id="23">I remember how we were all able to communicate, communicate without a phone, computer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Together with her sister we were on vacation at his grandmother's granddaughter talked with a neighbor when we meet again next summer for grandmas - and so it was, that's true.</seg>
<seg id="25">We met.</seg>
<seg id="26">Promise you now with someone that you will see in a year?!</seg>
<seg id="27">I also remember the winter when we ran out of the entire village, built snowmen, rode on a snowy hill at the church on bags stuffed with hay.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then we together with the whole family had dinner and talked about the day.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course my sister and I used to hear every night before the notorious phrase, "Go wash your hands!"</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, it is true today, but definitely not in the bathroom to tap Bound soap in a net of lemons.</seg>
<seg id="31">After dinner, when dad in the garage "worked" in beer with Jarda from the village, we lie down with my mom on the floor, resting his feet on the stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listen to the crackling that poured through the stove.</seg>
<seg id="32">We were close - really - we did not count how many we have friends on the social network, we knew how much we have friends, real ones!</seg>
<seg id="33">We talked - we talked - we did not write daily messages through various chats, SMS.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nothing of the sort, and yet we knew about each other a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so I could continue for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking through the album there, where are neatly glued black corners due to black and white photos.</seg>
<seg id="37">And if I happen to know how old I was then, back photos is always written in the year the picture was taken.</seg>
<seg id="38">Watch that although we haircuts by not suit pots too, and we should pant after cousin of two larger numbers, no one before us laugh, it was so normal (not IN).</seg>
<seg id="39">And I prefer to turn back on that step forward - into reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2013, I'll wait and see what the modern age must invent one for my kids.</seg>
<seg id="41">What I do know is that these are now my memories for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the times" and I think a lot come to this "předopičí" for not experience too.</seg>
<seg id="42">I would like to wish them!</seg>

<seg id="7">Because of maneuvering politicians lived long in the business sector uncertain about whether the revolutionary changes ultimately will or not.</seg>

<seg id="9">Of the 61 percent of companies heavily engaged in new Labour 26 percent said that their companies had taken all the necessary steps to be ready in time.</seg>

<seg id="2">One peaceful day to the end of August the German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of roofs American outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media claims that the Office BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and this action launched in Berlin exchange between the American and the German foreign minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, in September again insisted that the United States used its foreign intelligence capabilities, "to steal trade secrets for the benefit of foreign companies and U.S. companies to strengthen their international competitiveness and increase their profits."</seg>
<seg id="6">But since then, the Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and business leaders already know, if they believe the words of the director.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied in the Brazilian oil company, gained access to data under the control of U.S. Cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo reached a general paranoia about the state tracking new dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came with the revelation that the phone Chancellor Angela Merkel was maybe ten years old bugged.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certainly potential targets and business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden made ​​translucent intense collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would say that it is possible that the data is used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of bits, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a survey published in July advisory service EY German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now represents as great a risk as China.</seg>

<seg id="23">The scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies discovered Snowden is for some companies who still believed that the greatest threat is the monitoring of China, yet shocking.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now is a great turnover in cloud computing, where European leaders in a broad range realized that the data stored in the U.S. fall under local jurisdiction, and are therefore potentially open to challenge.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the business community Cloud Security Alliance about 10 percent of non-US members after unveiling the USA Prism data mining abandoned plans to use cloud provider based in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, said: "We have a new question for customers who have not been here before - where my data is stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction remain physically?"</seg>
<seg id="27">Many high-ranking German officials argue that the latest messages are just confirming what we already knew: that powerful nations want to steal their most precious secret, and this data must be protected at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is carried out economic espionage is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It always happened.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is a vital topic for many years and will not change significantly even during the current debate," said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Agrochemical company.</seg>
<seg id="31">Americans we conducted espionage on commercial and industrial level, as we carry out spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Enterprise leaders generally do not want to brag too countermeasures that have made that possibly not provided by the attacker advantage.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of large companies have a long history recalls that marry the fair free USB memory drive or leave unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board carmaker Audi said that for many years it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the Board of cell phones, they can not be used as a listening device.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German office BfV managers like to consider whether not to use when traveling abroad easy prepaid cell phones because of the risk that smart phones can embezzle.</seg>
<seg id="36">Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to hacking and tracking vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," he warns in his report BfV.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasures of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect life mouse to dependence on nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before testing on humans is necessary to perform additional tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical Faculty in New York, says that early indications are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have exhausted all methods available in the market today, but found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that the current approaches overcome all," said professor Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information to create antinikotinových antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to create a steady stream of these antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Antibodies persecute any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get to the brain, thereby preventing the smoker get the nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests vaccinated mice were subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the mice that were not vaccinated, "calm", said the researchers, which is a sign that they had received nicotine to the brain.</seg>
<seg id="11">Experimenty jsou popsány v časopise Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccine have failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The injections have to be administered as frequently to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, however proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because the liver cells to convert factories antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Crystal said that if future vaccine for humans will be completely safe, could be given to children before they have the taste of a cigarette a try, and would avoid the addiction to nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="16">More likely, it would not have used smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine that will have no benefit, and it will help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.</seg>

<seg id="16">Jump to the present is harsh awakening like to discuss with a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to commemorate those optimistic days - they seem distant memories, sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years after I threw my first ballot, really has changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was certainly nothing of what I had imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I recognize that Obama achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law of care available through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the policy of "Do not ask questions, to say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstruction reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: the other is that immigration reform, public option to choose health care and the closure of Guantánamo.</seg>
<seg id="22">But in many situations where I had colleagues and friends defended the Obama administration, I respect the explanations that can provide, reached the absolute limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">I found myself in the place of political hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obstruction of the Republicans can not explain the agreement with intercepting foreign leaders or the drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Unable to explain to them that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that persecutes those who expose government misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="26">They can not be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakího, an American citizen, without trial or for limiting public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="27">They can not justify the report's findings, saying that White House efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">A recently nor excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the Act of care available to a simple website.</seg>
<seg id="29">I do not know whether something like this could be expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I had 18 years to suspect that the power of government may be in conflict with political campaigns that preceded it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Elected office obviously has a predictable course and our public conversations will shape the opposition political party and random events, such as the massacre in Newton.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, all of the examples I mentioned above, to a large extent seem to be the result of his own administration's decision.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be unable to consolidate its policy or position.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, which we had heard.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, it is a return to 2008 - with how support for Obama this week fell below 45% - through this book becomes increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me remember the series of promises that are lost.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read a chapter in a book about how Obama during the primaries in Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="40">The additional meeting during the campaign he told his staff that he had to get back up to speed and stay true to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want to back our magic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must not forget who we are.</seg>
<seg id="43">Five years later, Mr. President, and totally agree with you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Mature earlier</seg>
<seg id="2">Research has shown that Afro American and Latina reach puberty earlier than their White peers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes do not mean that approaching puberty</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence that for these hormones or other chemicals</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts say that one of the starters earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys.</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should the mother horrified when her daughter begin to grow breasts and pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual meeting of the American Academy of paediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida explains pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes among American girls are quite common and represent a new standard.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A lot of time was spent by my parents assured that this is not usually the sign of a rapid evolution towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz</seg>
<seg id="11">Visible signs of development, such as breast development, pubic and underarm and body odor, the girls appear earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over the last forty years, however, was only a small shift in the age when menstruation occurs first.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States there are now an average age of 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years of age in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you start to develop breasts, pass a minimum of two to three years, pending the first period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Early puberty in girls : Essential guide for the management of this frequent problem)</seg>
<seg id="15">The most reliable test of how puberty will continue, it's time.</seg>
<seg id="16">Discussion about what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if it is accompanied by the growth of breast growth spurt before 8 years of age, a girl is considered "precocious".</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process slows down or stops - which can paediatricians carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="18">Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist performed tests to exclude serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments that delay the early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to cessation of growth stunting in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations on medications and hormonal therapy are dependent on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosociologické are also important aspects.</seg>
<seg id="22">When it comes to medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems girl and her feelings of being different from their peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">Of course is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters had menstruation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I'm worried that it may become pregnant, or how it will cope with hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started having menstrual periods at age 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were signs of menstruation and we talked, was not ready emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school frightened and upset, that is the first of her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even though there is no coherent body of evidence that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - reaching puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2001 helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which connects the body fat with the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support that conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country the Afro American and Latina tend to reach puberty earlier than their White counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">The explanations range.</seg>
<seg id="36">From a global point of view, it seems that patterns of early puberty are affected by everything from economic conditions through climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next puzzle: Although boys are already at an early age appears hair on the face and pubic area, the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other physicians participating in the conference of the American Association of paediatricians (AAP) have added to the complexity of this topic further.</seg>
<seg id="39">Acne and pubic hair is common even among infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We have to be careful as to how to identify the true onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist from Goryebské Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get from your child's doctor instructions on how to talk with your child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may involve the need to talk with your child earlier than expected," he Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you are calm, your child will probably respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who develop earlier, they need assurance that even if this is done too early, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nonsense in the movie Gravity are, but it's a beautiful sight, experts say</seg>
<seg id="2">Fantastic film of gravity of the universe some time after sold-out premiere in Czech cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="3">October saw him by the Union of Film Distributors nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of the reviews assesses positively the image.</seg>
<seg id="5">Others, however, there are some inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="6">Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and if you noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.</seg>
<seg id="7">George Dusek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I love sci-fi movies that I think are modern, dreamy fairy tale.</seg>
<seg id="8">Film Gravity is included, while acting as a "physically real" performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">No, but that does not mean it was bad.</seg>
<seg id="10">I enjoyed it very much.</seg>
<seg id="11">Note the hair you need to Sandra Bullock, who somehow raises in a state of weightlessness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hubbův Space Telescope and the International Space Station after moving significantly different orbits, so they can not be seen in one shot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some viewers of the film accuse unrealistically acting effect and the whole fire behavior in weightlessness.</seg>
<seg id="14">The suits would have also withstood such wounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">The heroes in the movie Gravity often come into conflict with various objects and clothing without too much trouble all last.</seg>
<seg id="16">Critics were not spared either storyline.</seg>
<seg id="17">So vast tragedy in Earth orbit, according to some panelists unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, they wonder why the doctor was sent into space to repairing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">People on the forums arguing about "unreal" behavior lan.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is said to act like it was designed for bungee jumping.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium. Prague): I saw him not only to the wide screen, but I can definitely say I was enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm glad it was not a documentary film, but science-fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">And with such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to hold consistently reality.</seg>
<seg id="24">"More than you mentioned discrepancies me touching it, as is shown three times the space station with the degrading level of technology (Last Chinese)."</seg>
<seg id="25">"China will indeed until the end of the decade and will probably look better than the movie."</seg>
<seg id="26">Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences): The computer-generated scenes, the authors successfully trying not to violate the laws of physics, so Sciences, facing the viewer will appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and crashes quite rightly maintains momentum, speaking dictionary physics, also view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including thin-skinned atmosphere and aurora flickering on the polar regions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Irregularities are considered in detail surely find it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Additionally, for example, when I read comments found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appear to reverse than it should in fact be (from west to east).</seg>
<seg id="29">George Stephen (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things filmmakers adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and egregious offense against logic or the laws of nature, I noticed in the film and in comparison with other films with similar aims is to see that the creators made a point of credibility to the events displayed.</seg>
<seg id="30">The moments that do not make sense worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits the otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result is significantly different relative speed and rescue operation would, therefore, could not in fact take place, as was shown in the film.</seg>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, at the moment of separation Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I noticed that the whole ISS rotated, so it is not clear the origin of the forces acting on Kowalski, who makes both actors to undertake at the moment, when it is not moving against each other.</seg>

<seg id="17">Each manufacturer is different plans.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided to attend the first flight and then focus on the update and we did.</seg>
<seg id="19">This will happen during the entire flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Bombardier, the second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer to start to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier claims that evaluate your plan putting the aircraft into service in the coming months and will provide updated information.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with internal company plan Bombardier - probably reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.</seg>

<seg id="30">Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division accounted for 30 September 32.9 billion, which is unchanged at 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Results in aviation were in line with our views, but low intake of orders and the overall state of the market has let us down," said Beaudoin.</seg>
<seg id="32">Revenue in the aerospace industry declined by 13 percent to $ 2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, said that revenue in this division grew by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion USD.</seg>
<seg id="34">Unfulfilled contracts in transport accounted for 30 September 32.6 billion, which is compared to 31 December marginal growth.</seg>
