<seg id="2">The Business for Britain campaign (trade for Britain) was started in April with a promise to businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU, they want to see the British entrepreneurs and companies that create jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">For this purpose we entered the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we are leading British businessmen asked about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on the country to modernize and grow, while EU countries stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see how the government gives priority to new business ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, than to mired in a long and arduous process of reforming European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When we asked for their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly laws and regulations on products - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs, they said, that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trading area - the agreement expressed even 40 percent of large companies, is traditionally the most pro-European of the company.</seg>
<seg id="10">And, in the end, our survey of businesses showed that most impressive knowledge, and that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change of the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">The findings, with whom to identify companies of various sizes and major business groups, shows that the business sector are pushing for "meaningful change," which brings back influence in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">A lot is at stake - the amendments to the contract and a better deal for Britain may mean profit up 16% of the vote in a referendum on remaining in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should not hesitate: This survey shows that British business supports his plan revised the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that the business sector expects that the amendment would mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back toward Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for Britain is possible, given how the eurozone issues on the way for closer economic and fiscal union, and increasingly necessary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority has to be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of the survey show, for a business that is the focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="6">After the completion of Phase Two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June, the government revised the estimated cost to build a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The British government, which led the talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, the company HS2 to find additional rail capacity, and the possibility of improving travel times for the north of England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">That includes the possibility of some travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London meeting three hours or less.</seg>

<seg id="15">For the Scottish Government Keith Brown Mr Carmichael said to "strongly" supported the inclusion of Scotland to the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "high-speed line has the potential to produce Scotland immense economic benefits, but also adds to the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case high-speed railway across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">With enthusiasm, therefore, we are working with the British government to investigate the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland and so bring benefits to all, and to add to the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government as planned.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to the review of the report on the study along with British ministers during the next year and a common decisions on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines is planning to charge hand luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 during his years as the imposition of carry-on luggage on board.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines is planning to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all the can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee for carry-on luggage is concerned at the top of the storage space, so a small bag under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company says it will charge $25 Frontier, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 if passengers will wait until the arrival of payment to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokesman for the company's Frontier Kate O' Malleyová stated that stodolarový fee is to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"do we pick the charge," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The airlines have begun to charge brought the first and second bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees and poured into carry-on bags hidden in the storage space, as best they could, so often lacking in this space instead.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fees are one way to learn, to take on board took less things.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 'Malleyová said that the purpose of this new fee is not actually get more money.</seg>
<seg id="12">The point is that the company's most loyal customers Frontier is clearly expressed that to find a place in the top of the storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who bought tickets purchased on the company's website, they will not pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is, that one passenger in line at the gate of the company Frontier may bring baggage, for which does not pay anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same baggage will pay $100.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 'Malleyová said that Web pages and handling procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">New Frontier's fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer, but the date has not been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline's love.</seg>
<seg id="18">Claims that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service, they should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street see other baggage fee as a sign that the airlines are trying to collect enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">But most of the fees for carry-on luggage did.</seg>
<seg id="21">The company Spirit Airlines as the first zpoplatnila hand luggage before three years ago and other low-cost Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only company, which also has such charges, is Hungary's Wizz Air, said aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">In its report in December 2011 estimated that a fee for carry-on luggage Spirit will bring the company $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, the former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit of companies and marveled at what he saw at the gate, when he met with an unusual fee of Spirit's carry-on luggage.</seg>
<seg id="25">"boarding the smoothest, it was what I had ever seen in his aviation career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I waited at the gate, I see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and the onset passed in an instant."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also makes the charges after the model of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda and juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said that passengers who will get a soda or juice, coffee may retain the can and will be free of charge full.</seg>
<seg id="30">The water will continue to be given free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to introduce fees for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later retreated and no other significant airline nenapodobila her.</seg>
<seg id="32">The last move of Frontier charge of carry-on luggage, if a passenger nezakoupí years directly from the airline, is the latest attempt to steer customers directly to their Web sites.</seg>
<seg id="33">The airlines are paying Internet travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could all airlines initiative, to lead passengers to buy directly from them, the place to do it through online travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="35">The company Frontier, however, went furthest in this area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September she started to give customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half miles in the frequent flyer programme.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the center of the ořízla remuneration for nalétané miles to 25 percent of miles out of the way.</seg>
<seg id="38">So does the remuneration of the Frontier long journey of 1,000 miles purchased over the Internet travel agency 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">Customers also allows the company to choose their seat in advance only in the event that the purchase will be carried out directly through the company's Web site Frontier.</seg>
<seg id="40">The company Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and is losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the financial results referred to in the middle of a corporate partner of the Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity has shrunk by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="42">The Republic is trying to resolve the sale of the airline's financial problems of the company Frontier.</seg>

<seg id="3">In November of last year the analysis took over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 200 of them was published in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) ads on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Internet is thus becomes the most important medium for the publication of job offers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet in 2005, when the survey conducted for the first time, made his share of 26 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) steadied at about 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advertising job opportunities in her analysis by largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="8">An example of this may be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, in 2007, nearly 25 900 ads was published in the same period in 2012 was less than half that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The posts on the Internet is oriented to closer, in particular, more qualified group of professions.</seg>
<seg id="11">By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those working-class, Pavlína Šťastnová introduced the author of the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12">The level of representation of the selected professional groups is different in the two media.</seg>
<seg id="13">The front of the advertisements on the Internet in search of managers and executives, the trade representative, programmers and financial experts.</seg>
<seg id="14">The position of hackers or small business leaders acted only on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="15">The daily newspaper is significantly lower the proportion of these specialist professions, on the other hand, a large representation include in particular service and blue-collar professions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Education, of course, are among the most commonly reported requirements that employers are expressed through advertising offer.</seg>
<seg id="17">To further the areas of knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.</seg>
<seg id="18">The daily newspaper on knowledge of a foreign language requirement has been placed in three percent of advertisements on the Internet at 37 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only two percent of advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">'computer literacy' claims appeared in 40 percent of the ads in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="22">The requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals to practice.</seg>
<seg id="23">The head of the production and other executives.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the working-class professions is mainly about the mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or the repair of electrical equipment, said study author George Tillner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employers also in the middle of their ads state requirements on the qualities and skills of potential bidders.</seg>

<seg id="1">A fifth of shopping centres is struggling with low our attendance</seg>
<seg id="2">According to data from estate consultancy company Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Prague Bohnicích Krakow Shopping Center opens to the public, will be 19 Prague shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The disappointing performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main problems are inappropriately large centre on the site and bad layouty, so too much floors or complicated and chaotic organisation passages, or dead space center," said Michael Sotak of company Cushman & Wakefield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also according to the head of the department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samadi is dealing with our attendance low about a fifth of the trade center.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among the main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of the local population or an overcapacity in the market in a given place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were particularly disappointing at first.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today the customers are somewhat conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new trade center must work harder to 'lure' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, service and marketing events," Samadi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The shopping center occupancy in Sotáka is generally stable, even in some of the centres to increase, because landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of rent and dopronajmout some units.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the truth is that recently opened some of the projects, which are not fully occupied and reduce the average occupancy so (Breda & Weinstein, for example in Opava Šantovka in Olomouc)," Sotak said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trade center opened in the past two years to promote the market by Sylvia Samadi very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">But there is room in the market for new projects.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, in Prague, we see scope for the construction of the project, which would serve the people of Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="18">Certainly there is room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called "convinience centres," aimed at daily purchases and services necessary for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is also under Sotáka on the domestic market place for other shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="20">And as for the little 'service' center, so for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects or expand in regional cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"city as Kladno, Czech Republic, Brno or Plzeň Sotak have room for further growth," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Prague he sees room for the upcoming trade centre in Champion Square, according to him have a clear potential Na Prikope street and Wenceslas Square.</seg>
<seg id="23">"intensively expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover is developing and expanding into smaller and smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or shopping centers, and the reconstruction of such as reconstruction of the sietch commercial home Prior, which benefit from good locations," she added Dita Kubánková of company DTZ.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross pronajímatelných areas.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of all these shopping center is located in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, stems from the company INCOMA GfK data.</seg>
<seg id="27">The number of shopping parks in the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with those of Britain and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic about 50 square meters per thousand people.</seg>

<seg id="6">The potential change was a closely-guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only a few of the president's closest advisers - including Daleyho, former head of the Obama campaign Jim Messina and former main advisers in the White House of David Axelroda and David Plouffeho - knew that he is considering this change.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book "double down" claims that Daley was a leader of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that in the meantime, before he finally decided to perform this move as data showed that adding Clinton on a ticket," Obama's chances would be substantially increased."</seg>

<seg id="2">While American road planners struggling to find the money to repair crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, which is easily fits into the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The device, which monitor every mile, who travelled a motorist, and transmit that information to the authorities, are at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and offices for the state planning to renovate the outdated system of financing America's main roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">Generally dull design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of a variety of associations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for it, so that the government could use these small boxes, which would record the distance travelled and perhaps even that, where you're going - and then use this information to build a tax notice.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is terrified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states to expect nothing.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the next decade, they may move to a system in which a driver pays for half a mile of the road, after which he was going.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists had already black boxes, some of which are using GPS tracking, take to the test.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a real need for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not an issue, when we have the power to choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration for this state in southern California, which plans to launch the monitoring of vehicle kilometres in each of California motorists in 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">Changes to the way we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Use this technology to do so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The incentive is the fact that Road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars travel more miles per gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians have also been reluctant to raise the tax on only a single cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars, to test the system of paying per kilometre driven.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It appears to be in the long term as the most logical alternative," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The experts call it a user fee by mileage.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the urban liberals like this idea, because the tax can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers, which, for example, can help to reduce traffic congestion and the creation of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="25">California's designers look to this system in planning strategies, which are to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious laws on global warming.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Bill Shuster, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also sees this as a long-term alternative nejfunkčnější.</seg>
<seg id="27">The leaders of the free market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined towards the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not a tax, which would disappear into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organisation of Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People pay directly for what they receive.</seg>
<seg id="30">The initiative also support the two former American transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to set off in the direction of paying for half a mile.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate last year approved a pilot project for $90 million, which should include about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and have done so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the components of the population whose daily life often means travel many miles to work outside the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities, however, is moving forward on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">Most ardent in Oregon, which is the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon start to pay a tax to the state for the distance travelled, instead of the tax on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York's project examines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying to do this in a limited fashion in trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 of the ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies, how can implement this change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not just a champion.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where the device was recently about 50 cars equipped with volunteers, drivers were concerned by the fact that the government is able to follow their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"concerns regarding the monitoring of the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads management strategy and operations on officials of the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something that people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the project went on, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on their website warned: "It would be very easy to turn the device on a full tracking device."</seg>
<seg id="45">It is not necessary to build a ponderous technological infrastructure, which will inevitably spread to the registration of day trips and the arrival of individuals.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology, which would allow the state to keep track of how many miles the car hit, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do it, said Khan, the public will be calmer.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to small companies in California named True Mileage (real the distance travelled).</seg>
<seg id="49">The company originally into action to help the government was not involved in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">She wanted to break through in the emerging market with third-party liability insurance, where drivers would be paid on the basis of how much travel.</seg>
<seg id="51">But this is testing the device, which attracts the attention of the planners of the road network, because only a limited amount of information that does not use GPS and supplies are regularly recorded using a modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to go, if nesledujete their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">A number of major errors appeared in some of these pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon designers experimented with it, that they give drivers a choice.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose the GPS device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or you do not need to take any of the equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the people of the state.</seg>
<seg id="58">In other places they hope to alert the public to the concept initiated, if the device will be able to more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the city of New York, transport officials trying to develop the device tax, which would be equipped to pay fees for parking hours, so that it was possible to provide insurance to kilometres travelled and that collected data on the rate of other drivers, so motorists can avoid a traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="60">"motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," states the document projection of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some traffic engineers would, however, like to know whether any discussion of the payment per kilometre are not just a placeholder problem.</seg>
<seg id="62">Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could solve the problem with zbankrotovaným road Trust Fund very simply by an increase in the gasoline tax.</seg>
<seg id="63">Single or annual tax could be levied on the driver's hybrid or other cars, which many nespotřebují fuel, so they will pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"no radical surgery is needed, when is enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about privacy and a lot of other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">With a billionaire will next year on the phone?</seg>
<seg id="2">Kellner, owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the mobile operator O2.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two companies confirmed the talks, according to various sources of agencies, from behind the scenes, says he had a hand in the hole.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the transaction should come back in November, probably before the start of the auction spectrum for LTE network, that is, before 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Karel Komarek Kellnerův competitor KKCG own group.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is the mark of Sazka Telecommunications dropped to auction spectrum for LTE network.</seg>
<seg id="7">To everyone's surprise, and that in the meantime the taste of firms to penetrate into telecommunications was not mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunications veteran Robert Chvatal.</seg>
<seg id="9">He started as a marketing chief of RadioMobil (today T-Mobile), eventually became the director of the Slovak T-Mobilu and last in charge of the Austrian branch of the same operator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sazka plays a few cards at once.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bid in the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for Vodafone virtuála.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="13">If he succeeds in an auction, so the network will be able to move into their existing customers from its virtual operator.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would be like under normal circumstances like Vodafone, but according to information of Hospodářské noviny that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vodafone currently suffer by competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who are completely to share their networks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vodafone so he needs a partner.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that may be just Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="18">If that succeeds in the tender for the LTE network (as a rookie can spectrum auction specially designed), as Vodafone's auction may not go at all, or he won't mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (frequency is not enough for all).</seg>
<seg id="19">Vodafone, namely the Sazkou can share the network.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vodafone drops Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network to 900 MHz frequency), thus enabling the company a quick start of the network.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sazka in between starts to build costly LTE network, which will be able to use and Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="22">The two companies may be happy with.</seg>
<seg id="23">The money saved would then Vodafone could spend some solid Internet providers or cable television.</seg>
<seg id="24">And Kellner?</seg>
<seg id="25">That would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately won a full operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the other hand, it's a big juggernaut, which will wait for the restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an auction would receive the LTE network Kellner even in the O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobilem.</seg>
<seg id="28">The two companies already had declared that the network will share.</seg>
<seg id="29">The auction might finally be a success, but probably not enough with huge sums of money to enjoy the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between the call with Vodafone T-Mobilem Kellnerem or Komárkem.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or the two titans of the Czech business against global giants.</seg>

<seg id="4">Liverpoolský crown court sentenced him to three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="5">A top lawyer, who informed the drugs Mafia on a large scale of the police investigation, because he feared that his drug addiction comes out, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta (42) had after he was suspected of cocaine use, the underworld boss Neil Scarbroughovi transmit sensitive information about the investigation into his activities related to drug trafficking.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) criminals and which has been hailed as the best legal representative, after police monitoring Scarborougha, which in earlier proceedings involving narcotics represent, arrested at his home in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">Police officers saw Sarborougha (32), as he left in a house in Lancashire Blackburnu právníkově, who was having dinner with colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the basis of the tests, in which they found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, trying to get information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborougha archly and his companion.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being monitored at the time as part of an investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Cumbria, Lancashire, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">After police arrested during a series of hauls of heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million in cash, along with £200,000 in prison together with them over the next 32 people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta (42) passing on information to the criminals out of fear that they would come to his addiction to cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, Forbes Solicitors Ditta, who works for a company based in Blackburnu experienced before the crown court liverpoolským shameful moment, when he was found guilty of that, after a three-week trial that defense of the administration of justice in two cases.</seg>
<seg id="15">During an earlier hearing he admitted to possession of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's fall came after Scarborougha police investigation found that he was in February 2011 in regular phone contact with Dittou.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives suspect tracked, recorded his arrival to Dittova house and saw him placed the drugs about 60 percent below the lawyer's pure trash in the black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was subsequently Scarborough Dittou, who was at the dinner at the football stadium with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, in a telephone interview.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there have been nine of talks between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="20">In court, said that he found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards and that Ditta was "a regular user of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said that he spoke with the suspected dealer, therefore, that was his client, and argued that their conversation is in "confidential communications."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to get a few of her credit cards, but all were detained and were his hair samples.</seg>
<seg id="23">During police questioning, he said that his office at his home address in the workplace, and that clients because of labor affairs visited him at home as well.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard that after the key arrests contacted a significant player in the drug supply chain, some of which had been represented, to tell them what they know of them detectives.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more than aware that must not violate the law, the legal representative in the area of criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and that he was in close contact with a client too.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship, that we're talking about here is not just about a drug pusher, but into a drug dealer who supplied his own lawyer drugs.</seg>

<seg id="33">Ditta refused the wrongdoing and said: "I was corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I would like to give Mr Scarboroughovi information, I didn't expect 15 hours, but I'd do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">After the hearing, however, the police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta from a lawyer in the criminal field alone has become a criminal when he began to obtain drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leaders of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.</seg>
<seg id="36">Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and to inspire confidence in public, and feel that they can count on them.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the guise of their profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">The unit for serious and organised crime in Lancashire ran against Mr Dittovi investigations, on the basis of which was also sentenced to three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals before the court.</seg>

<seg id="40">We will find you and put before our courts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama is backing away from health care</seg>
<seg id="2">After a wave of criticism of President Obama yesterday backed away from his often repeated and ambitious promise, that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With reference to the hundreds of thousands of notification of testimonies from providers Republicans in recent days accused the president of misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama flinched from its original promise.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, you can keep it," he said in his speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">With regard to what he called the "rumors in the media," the testimonies, Obama called on Americans who received the notification to the search for new policies on the market.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of the people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even less than expected.</seg>
<seg id="8">You'll get a better offer," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population, which buy insurance for itself, may be forced to change the program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on the care available.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I say that these Americans on the plane: You deserve something better," Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Law on the care available, she said, that the launch of the online market was "miserable" from October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.</seg>

<seg id="14">Irritated Sebelius this sentence, which caught on microphone, said yesterday in the direction of advisors seated behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which was held after a stormy exchange of views with Republikánem Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, which was the subject of whether she herself has involved in the Obama care program.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours during a hearing on Sebeliusovou repeatedly pressed the question, why the "architect" of the care available voluntarily gave up on a government sponsored insurance, and nezakoupil program through HealthCare.gov, which now is forcing millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to the villages in Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team treated almost every weekend hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">In the countries of West Africa is not too many doctors; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vote here or via their mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major candidates on the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the competition for the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013, you can vote for him or for any of the 10 major candidates.</seg>
<seg id="8">The winner will receive $250,000, so that he could continue his extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father has deteriorated again and again into unconsciousness and go to hospitals, which were not equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash near the capital city of Yaounde, Cameroon, in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="11">First he treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that has spread to the brain, and there a hematoma, which caused him problems throughout his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Cameroon were no neurosurgeons," says Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">We had to take him out of Cameroon, if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years by his father ferried into the crowded clinics and hospitals, where he had received such treatment, which was just available.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can get out of the house at five in the morning rush to the hospital, you were there first, but not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people die just because you have to wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since 2002, when Bwelleho father died, the situation hasn't changed much.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the World Health Organisation in Cameroon is only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just for comparison, the ratio is one doctor at 413 people in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if the doctor could visit the Cameroonians, many could not afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem is poverty, which they have," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because of poverty, she cannot take her life.</seg>
<seg id="26">When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted last year for free 700 operations.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he founded the non-profit organisation ASCOVIME, whose members at the weekend visit rural areas, where they provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people napěchuje supply to be attached to the roof of medical supplies and travel rough terrain to the villages, which are in need of help.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is not always accompanied by luck.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once, the vehicle must push through the water and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they will welcome as the real heroes: The feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, which a community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the villages of free medical care is really the reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - are very willing to engage local merriment.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next day the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"on every trip we have 500 patients," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">During each of these weekends doctors provide different medical assistance.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, and diseases parazitními sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others may get the crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free - the document, which calls for the school, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening the team is under local anaesthetics a simple operation.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operation is usually do in the school building in the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes into zotavovacího points, to relax for the next patient.</seg>
<seg id="44">By means of light from a generator, the operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work in the early morning hours.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's exhausting, but village musicians usually the team's help, to maintain his motivation.</seg>
<seg id="46">"us to stay up all night and continued their work, play the drums," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of his work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group - consisting of Cameroon's doctors and foreign medical students - 700 operations carried out last year, free of charge, and he is aware that their aid may mean a lot for the local people.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man said that after a hernia operation will be able to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"It will change the future of our family," said the man.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to organizing the following weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works in the night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">He says that this second work finances about 60% of its unprofitable activities; the rest cover private contributions.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former editor of the News of the World newspaper (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used methods" to hack into the phone, monitoring and confrontation," he said fraudulent tip on a love relationship in which should be involved then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew EDIS said that the News of the World newspaper picked up at the Old Bailey court in May 2005 false reports that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlbyovou.</seg>
<seg id="4">Newspapers have attributed the private investigator Glenn Mulcairea to hack into the voicemail Pawlbyové and penetrated her privacy, but the court said that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.</seg>
<seg id="5">State prosecutor suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW is not a man who stands in front of the house, and he hopes that people will catch on the outside, but a man who loved the people want stories, to see what they say," Mr EDIS said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The newspaper said that the examination of the stories used three ways: Nabourávání NotW is on the phone, tracking and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the other, monitoring, must know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">And what about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">He knows about nabourávání is on the phone?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says no, we say: "Oh, yes, he knows that."</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumors of a love affair, in which Clarke is involved, they were first captured the NotW newspapers, as the source for the story, which was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlbyovou, was told: "You're wasting your time, that is with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">Counting the record with vocal messages from her phone on at least three occasions, was acquired in Mulcairově house in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlbyová and her sister were referred to as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period when it was investigating Mrs. Pawlbyová, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls, in which they were asked for information about Pawlbyové, Mr EDIS said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watchdog to monitor the movement of Mrs Pawlbyové.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coulson her 18 June 2005 left a voice message, in which he told her: "I've got a story that we are going to go tomorrow and on which I would very much like to talk with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr EDIS says Coulsona involvement in the story was the same model as for other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David BLUNKETT.</seg>
<seg id="19">In court on Thursday said that Coulson confronted Mr Blunketta for romance with a married woman, while he himself saw the spoluobžalovanou Rebecca Brooksovou, which at the time was married.</seg>
<seg id="20">Brooks and Coulson deny conspiracy with other persons to hack into the phones in the period between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.</seg>

<seg id="2">Under a statue of Samory Machely, founder, with thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, Mozambique President to a rare public demonstration cheered peace slogans.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Out of fear for the future of their country changed corporate dress over a T-shirt adorned with the words "demand safety" in Portuguese and joined in on Thursday to the crowd at Independence Square in the capital city.</seg>
<seg id="5">After two weeks ago came almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo party on one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once notorious rebel movements, originally supported under white rule in Rhodesia and then the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise independent of the government of this country.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the peace agreement in 1992 to become an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely to open conflict broke out in the country again, but recent events startled foreign investors and local.</seg>
<seg id="9">At stake is a rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of large offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years may bring on the part of companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Italy's Eni and Anadarko, US investment in the value of more than $50 billion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of generated tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">The party Renamo claims that the government forced the last conflict by 17 September launched an attack on their members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Party of Renamo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Violent assaults on the former rebels subsequently peaked, when government forces attacked the base of the party Renamo and attempted to kill AFONSA Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times the Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames for triggering the conflict Renamo, because, he said, swatting at the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to assuage fears of instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza for the French press office told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as "a loser," that he would use "whatever is left of his forces to try to prove that the government can make their own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo claims that they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have increased, as have been cited the words of Mr Mazangy that Renamo party withdraws from the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">The FT said, that meant that the party, Frelimo already agreement preserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between these parties have done to alleviate the tension between these parties, caused by a series of skirmishes in this year, only a few.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's a skirmish between two large personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the Lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo party, to seek election changes, has already expressed that would have boycotted municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="24">The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to get the dying movement from the government benefits and financial returns.</seg>
<seg id="26">The share of the election of the party Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (investments), which was based on a former member of the Renamo, expected to improve their position in the election.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - which a second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"more than one party does not want a democratic system, does not want to be transparent elections, doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred miles away from the capital Maputo, but where is the city Beira port, which rely on mining companies, including companies Rio Tinto and Vale, in its coal exports.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June the company Rio has suspended the use of the railways for about a week, when the party Renamo threatened that on this line of attack.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo repeats his threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people also has concerns about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is to be borne exclusively by the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says, that people just want stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Nobody cares Renamo, Frelimo, or people just want peace, they want to have free access to the side of the road," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft makers argue about the width of the seats at stake are large contracts</seg>
<seg id="2">Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was unveiled a dispute about the width of the seats in the second grade for flights over long distances, which this month gave the cause of the bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="3">The subject of the dispute is granted the width of seats on long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one would usually preceded the airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to claims on efficiency at the last aircraft offered by Boeing and Airbus SAS.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main American rival Boeing says airlines should decide about it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of its two-engined long-range aircraft with the potential of a record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.</seg>
<seg id="6">So, how is the rear part of the plane disintegrated - especially if it is next to each other - 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic performance of "mini-jumbo" proposals for new aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company Boeing 777X says that the improved model," "delivers 406 people in economic a breadth of more than 43 cm spread after 10 seats in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company Airbus says competing versions of the A350 model delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread after 9.</seg>
<seg id="9">The giant aircraft are often attack each other in the technical issues through ads in the professional media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently provisionally showed what may be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers showed a picture showing three people in the restaurant with the headline "They would you like it?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in the seats closer than they are in regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the amended návky, people are eating more, but the seats on planes have radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 years, the US has increased by 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century over 100 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus contends that his rival is holding the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of new pokřtěného aircraft was lower.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company Airbus claims that carried out the research, which suggests that the extension of the seat of 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing rejects the dimensions of the seats of the Airbus company and says that it is not in the powers of the aircraft manufacturers to decide on how airlines exports fees and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also says research shows that experience in the cabin depend on more than just the width of the seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"really going for it, to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to carry out the things they are convinced that they have to do to be successful," said an expert on the cab area of Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want to dictate to them what brings them a profit.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">More space for passengers is essential for his elbows, but for the vendor is a growing problem, which can affect yields.</seg>
<seg id="24">For this dispute is the race with an estimated trade in the coming decades in aircraft orders worth at least $700 billion at catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of the American and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters reported in July, the distribution of seats is what drives the battle between the last aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claims that are in their most recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft about 20 percent better performance than the market leader in this segment, a model of the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.</seg>
<seg id="27">The performance claims Boeing 777X model design depends in part on a comparison with 10 seats in the series and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row.</seg>
<seg id="28">Profit in the unit costs compared with 10sedadlovému concept is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="29">"why that Boeing is doing, is home to more seats, and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus chief for the convenience of passengers in the company for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say, that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in accordance with the fact that many of the passengers is for thicker layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Forty five inches wide seat for passengers would have been great, but the reality is that, from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model," said Mary Kirby, an expert on the interior of the cabin, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network portal.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seat, but the airlines are offering a catalog of suppliers, to be able to choose.</seg>
<seg id="33">Scestovalí aircraft sellers even carry measurement of the zone to check the competitive arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="34">While wearing comfort, all producers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus is offering the A350 model with 10 seats in the series, but says it still sold.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently offered for some of its aircraft, Airbus emphasized the need for greater regulation of the cabin that wider seats in the aisles.</seg>
<seg id="37">Experts say that without the support of only one other producer of large modern aircraft call for new industry standards they will remain, but may deter them from the waves of the sale of the 777X.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots on the selection</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another ghost story on independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time appears warning that an independent Scotland is a condition for membership in the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="4">It gave the cause to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire fence along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as might be expected, it did not translate into newspaper headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also mentioned that the EU Member States spends much time by adapting their own laws, if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the continued non-compliance would be cheap for Brussels concession in return for anything from Scots really want.</seg>
<seg id="8">So it's pretty weak story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, in addition, so old that it has become a fossil. The canard that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet the bearded in this story is an interesting idea.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why shouldn't be expected, that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why change London's yoke for the Brussels, particularly now?</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a real European story: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="14">The influence of the crisis of the euro is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across Europe, the influence of the party of opposition to the EU or the euro as a common currency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - based in this year - came out of nowhere and they capture nearly five million votes in September's federal election, which essentially "sweep" the Free Democrats in the Bundestag (equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).</seg>
<seg id="17">On home soil was always the opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current economic crisis, however, has become a decisive moment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the jacket navléknutou on the national economy by adhering to the common currency project have led many people to think that Europe had gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks their members to exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency's southern Europe in domestic production of a disadvantage compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only by cutting public spending and revenue -- to which encourages Germany.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the current problems with the budget and currency is deeper cause European languid performance.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry is twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is paralyzing the disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not all the freezing salaries in the world would have forced the European petrochemical industry zadupání cheap oil slate from the US.</seg>
<seg id="28">The result is a smoldering rebellion, particularly in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that Germany will be held in check and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">Berlin and Paris as the card doesn't need political legitimacy and pushed for its own economic policy in Europe and worn the French economy to fend for itself.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: The National Front of Marine Le Pen, anti-European right wing, had just won an additional choice and subjugated the ruling Socialists in third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The line is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to the British Labor, that they cannot conclude that the split of the right to automatically positive effect on the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">As Le Pen disposes of its newfound popularity among the white working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">The European elections next year would like to use it to create the anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If they will do well in the elections of the anti-European party, which is likely, he can dominate a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">I can think of that in the foreseeable future is growing anti-European feeling and attitude would kill to unite against the common currency, the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not disappear, but rather transformed into something less rigorous (sovereign) within the meaning of the "Europe of Nations," already favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Several of Germany and its satellite economies may have left the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that the United Kingdom is from this project will go the distance and come to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="40">But increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to atlantickému cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">And where will Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be areas (basically) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend their own economic interests - in that era and the possibility to Berlin and Brussels, where we have to be.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suppose that Scotland would have fared well in the loose arrangement of Europe provided that would preserve its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in nefederální Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should take an example from Norway and to maintain their economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland - oddly - is the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition stance against planned cuts to (and implement) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence because only now, to adopt austerity measures laid down by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">The parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate gender."</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third gender in children born with ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
<seg id="3">The newborn children will no longer be ranked only either a male or female gender.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law from parents is not required to provide for such children either sex, and allows them to their birth gender sheets of paper as "vague" or "unspecified."</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law is to stop pushing for parents that their child rashly decided for the operation in order to determine the sex, and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersexuální.</seg>
<seg id="6">One person intersexuální, according to the BBC, after many years said: "I am not a man or a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I'll stay slátaninou created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is estimated that each year from 2000 children born one, which is not a boy or girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">Intersexuální, are part of a group of about 60 of the facts, which are covered by the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Intersexuální could be Wallis Simpson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States said it could not be determined if sex, it is better to use the best available information and identify them, instead of waiting and watching until the child's psychological and physical development operations are carried out, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in the problems with the designation of the sex, he said, that the new German law "looks like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersexuální children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people are in life-threatening condition, which requires an operation, but for most children, that is not the case," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sex determination can be made without the operation and then they can wait, how identity is evolving.</seg>
<seg id="16">The knowledge of how to work out for the child's gender is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one can answer the question, why is this happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a mystery why some people are homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="19">The report described the European Committee passed in 2011 intersexuální people as different from transgenderových or transgender people, because of their status is not bound to sex, but on their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and it cannot be clearly defined as not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, the hairline, breasts and figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and the genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also provides an overview of discrimination, which is experiencing intersexuální and transsexual people working in the field, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="22">The boys no gender nonconforming now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australia and Nepal mark in official documents already allow adult male, female or "third gender."</seg>
<seg id="24">Norrie May-Welby 52letá Australian, became the first recognised worldwide in June "sexless" party, won a court appeal, so that he could keep the status of "vague" by the end of the life of sex.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Ministry of the Interior will have the German passports but M (man) and F (woman) and a third title, X, for intersexuální persons.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France France 24, according to news reports on the issue of sex is still controversial.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dozens of French legislators in 2011 from this strongly Catholic countries have signed a petition to the "gender theory" was removed from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">America's website and online is against German law also define and wrote: "with the way the world is scraped to a new state, where sex is not a matter of choice, but sexual activity, převracíme inside out two other pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One mother of an infant from Maryland for Baby zone, also said that he would prefer to see that children have allocated gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"parenting itself is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of their child," said the Web pages on parental care.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, the children with both male and female sex called hermafrodité, according to the handsome River, who had dual gender.</seg>
<seg id="33">About ten years ago, the medical community and thought that sex is something like a table, which can erase and redraw again.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many are questioning the ethical basis operation with it, may decide that gender is a complex issue and doctors incorrectly, because they don't know how, because of their gender, children will feel when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in the middle of the 20th century was called the psychiatric emergency room," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">When the children were born, you call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory about how to deal with children with ambiguous gender, was presented to Dr. John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins, who took the view that sex is soft.</seg>
<seg id="38">It has created a new concept of "sex" and arguing that the social causes and environmental influences - both parents raised their child - acted on a child's genes and hormones and shaped regardless of whether the child was identified as a man or a woman.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan" with his theory has become controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of poorly made obřízce, recommended that their child had been left completely castrated, removed his testicles and it was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was 15 years old, left the přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said, that some doctors use this model" to this day.</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations have discovered "unhappy with the result."</seg>
<seg id="46">This was the case with Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but the ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
<seg id="47">The doctors were not sure whether it has a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that a man could never live "satisfactory life."</seg>
<seg id="48">And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed the bodies and balls and was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the 12 years he got the female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I was not a girl," said for ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask that question.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18 he was sent to the plastic sheath.</seg>
<seg id="53">But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found was frightening.</seg>
<seg id="55">After the birth I was sterilised and no one I never said anything.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with the disorder of the development of gender (DSD), who defended the body to produce sufficient quantities of testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After he had learned the truth, turned back to the man, taking the dose of testosterone and let you remove the breasts,</seg>
<seg id="58">The operation caused his infertility.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today is represented by others in the organization known as Interface Project and the perception of those who are trying to normalize intersexuální.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (supporters of an informed choice) is based in California, is concerned that the German law "calls for branding and stigmas."</seg>
<seg id="61">Many activists fear that German law reaches that will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose "vague" for a child," said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We're afraid it bids for intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We believe that it is better to allocate male or female gender and then wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we don't know how the law eventually lead, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattisová said that her organization supports Australian law, because "it allows adults choose to be included in the third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"adult should be able to make their own decisions about sex legally valid," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is going to assign him at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is a battle that, at this point, shouldn't seduce a small child.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about her own body.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratzová radioložka chest from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "shall be granted powers" of both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratzové daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD called syndrome numbness on androgen.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are defective, developed by Katie feminine features.</seg>
<seg id="73">He has a vagina, but does not have the womb and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now Katie 29letá is married and works as an intern in the studies at the University of Pennsylvania in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although it is barren, hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over the verdict handed down by the masterminding the Bali bombing</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded angrily to the judgment handed over the last of osnovatelů, who were brought to justice, and said that Umar Patek should be executed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for having assembled the explosive device, which was used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">For 15 years he could be paroled.</seg>
<seg id="5">This 45letý man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many of the wounded.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty on several counts related to terrorism, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecution has demanded a life sentence, although it could insist that the man with the nickname "Demolition Man" (bourač) thanks to her professional reputation for the production of explosives was given the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="8">This decision revived painful memories of June Corteenové, the mother of Perth, which in a devastating attack run Patekem and other osnovateli almost a decade ago lost their 39letá twins Jane and Jenny.</seg>
<seg id="9">With tears in her eyes, she said, that Patek should be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the agency AAP Ms Corteenová said: "should be tried before a firing squad."</seg>
<seg id="12">Every day I have to live with the fact that I see other grandchildren and their daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was razed to the ground, when she was 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hour fired a powerful bomb placed in a van parked outside.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in the bar Paddy, where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result of the explosion on the month he fell into a coma, and while he was kept alive on life support, "died" three times to doctors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the massacre - Amroziho Muchlase and Imam Samudru - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">This guy should get the death penalty as one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it just isn't.</seg>
<seg id="19">Get 20 years for this, that killed 202 people and wounded hundreds of others, is not all that much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek stood before the court as the last of the Bali bombers.</seg>
<seg id="21">The arrest avoided almost ten years, but in the end he was captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed a former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports have revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden and al-Qaeda in an attempt to re-establish the link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"voluntarily gave up," said Mrs Corteenová.</seg>
<seg id="24">To this day he felt regret for it, how much grief caused the other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will later this year and to which they belong to the ceremony in Bali and in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This year we'll see a lot of tears," said Mrs. Corteenová.</seg>

<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the court order requiring changes in the program to stop and search people at the police department in New York and the judge removed from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on an appeal lodged by the city.</seg>

<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday requested a postponement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge must be withdrawn from the case, because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, and that a judge acted in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public comments, which openly responded to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics as part of its programme of stop and search people.</seg>
<seg id="9">Set up an independent supervision, to oversee the changes, including reforms in the procedures, training and supervision, and ordered to run a pilot program to test the cameras worn on the body in some areas where there are the most common stopping people.</seg>

<seg id="11">The appeal of the city are scheduled for oral arguments sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tactic of stopping and frisking people criticized a number of civil rights activists</seg>
<seg id="13">There is a certain form of stopping and frisking people for about a decade, but the recorded tour under the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's independent dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases it was about blacks and Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2004, wrote the four men, all of whom are among the minorities, an action that has become a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of the changes the stopping and searching people conducted by the police department in New York, argues that the changes will put an end to the unfair practices, will increase the credibility and the effectiveness of the police force and may affect the way these procedures used by other police departments.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but no crime, and that is all the more wasted money, but will not solve the larger problem, which is a police force under pressure after his numbers have decreased in the last decade of several thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted that ended the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reform the way examinations of the police department in New York introduced.</seg>

<seg id="11">To my question how is it possible for me to be written, that personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send e-mail with the mistake.</seg>
<seg id="12">I did this (around 15 hours) yesterday and today, I replied that I was registered on the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.22 and that is why I can't do that, because I used the same name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="13">What about that contact technical support for a week and then with them that it still can't.</seg>
<seg id="14">And what about that if it was true what (is not like) says no one would be able to register with the same name and the same birth date if this is already registered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just by the way I was actually registered in the 13.22, on the same name and date of birth, but I used fictitious e-mail and telephone number and wonders, appeared to me for the moment that they sent me to e-mail a link to complete the registration.</seg>
<seg id="16">How is it possible, as they could not be registered in the same name and date of birth?</seg>
<seg id="17">Probably because the Tipsport tied the registration to e-mail and phone number and date simply has not surrendered as saying.</seg>
<seg id="18">So again I told this to technical support that simply lie (either intentionally or they don't know what they write), because that's what writing is not true.</seg>
<seg id="19">I added a few screens that the problem with the registration was "false" 31.10. so registering at this simply does not have the effect.</seg>
<seg id="20">To me it Tipsport wrote the stark sentence - I'm sorry, but that you have already registered again, we cannot check your claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">And communication ended.</seg>
<seg id="22">And repeated over and over the same sentence, that is tied to the name and date of birth registration.</seg>
<seg id="23">They can't even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and that, in fact, neither has taken place.</seg>
<seg id="24">If it gets sorted out, not only that the Tipsport not data as they claim, but still is lying when he claims to the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The worse is that it can be easily, as they lie, and trying to make it appear that the fault is on the side of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the way, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, set in motion a little things and e-mail came from the Technical aid that the matter be forwarded for review and will be informed (urgencí and after a week of wrangling and warnings on the same mistake).</seg>

<seg id="1">Fantastic ice cream, which glows in the dark?</seg>
<seg id="2">The British entrepreneur built the first ice cream, which glows in the dark - for the use of jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of a marine animal and developed the treat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea came when he read the scientific treatise on a jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China, to chemically produced a protein that causes phosphorescence.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ice cream eater responds with language - increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes her radiation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says that the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more lick, brighter September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, the company's founder zmrzlinářské "Chick me I'm comfortable" (olízni me, taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so you get for £200 about 2 g of this substance."</seg>
<seg id="8">We use a protein, which in ice cream, reacts with your language at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So how your mouth protein heat, increases the pH levels and ice cream begins to glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We tested it in the last couple of months and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of Halloween, because it causes this fantastic brilliant effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because luminescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that cost me about £140 each mound.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it tastes good.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for his unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and leaves of gold.</seg>
<seg id="15">His other product but is to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says: "I really wanted to make an ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">In essence it is impossible because of the quarry of light caused by ice crystals that form an ice cream, but I figure with it, that we can find a way to do it,.</seg>

<seg id="2">The October elections rather than the winners have brought a bunch of losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is not only the parties, which are in or out of the Chamber of Deputies (SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually ČSSD due to an internal split.</seg>
<seg id="4">Politicians get us instead of the tenderloin holiday weekend post-election stew.</seg>
<seg id="5">Springer elections happened Andrei Babiše movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and dissension in the winning side recording political (from) will Mr President Milos Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters who supported President Zeman's party publicly, nor did to the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="7">The president had lost because of unpleasant events strategic policy ahead of the others, but it still has several ways to get it back - for example, the choice of a future prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">While ČSSD the chance for a prime seat in my eyes away, traders Andreju Babišovi closing.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far though the post-election developments is miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of ČSSD left-wing government supported by the Communists, this development is the better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Given the loud opposition YES get together with the ODS and TOP 09, is still the most likely coalition scenario ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the split in ČSSD, which thus became illegible and weak parterem in negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be daunting enough for ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="12">The minority government ČSSD lodged with "nezemanovců" at the Castle probably won't pass.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, any government, to which the ČSSD will participate, will be jeopardised unmet ambition of many of the Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further split in the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm asking myself: 'Nespějeme unassisted to another early elections?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Another option would have been more of a referendum on the strength of the voters' mandate of the YES movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">ČSSD plans for the introduction of the tax sector, the marked increase in income taxes or the building of the State Bank fell hopefully under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ČSSD, YES, 19 and Dawn, on the contrary, agree to support business, for example, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, the lower tax rates for the selected goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friction is most prevalent in the view on social policy and the size of the state.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yes, but now has the upper hand, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, 19, leaning more to the right.</seg>
<seg id="20">From my point of view is that, in the end, a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything else in the economy moving.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scientists more illuminated the movements of the tail is connected with the mood of the dog</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier studies have shown that the radiant dog wags his tail more Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog), while nervous dogs waving tail mainly to the left.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, however, scientists say, that the other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail and respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a from the University of Trento said: "with the people it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain are of different link to the incentives, which are positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">The same thing we tried to discern in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that, just as it is in humans, dogs, too, is the right side of the brain responsible for the main movements, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an effort to gain more information about how the dogs respond to uneven wiggling tail of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals, which followed the films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Measured the heart rate of these animals and analyze their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will not be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on the one hand, and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "project we dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confounding incentives, and we also have been able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrated it more to the right or the left."</seg>
<seg id="11">When she saw the animals otherwise lackluster move the dog's tail Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), remained quite calm.</seg>
<seg id="12">When but recorded video tail mainly Justify|Left (again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), their heart rate has increased and the animals seemed uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Vallortigara said he does not think that the dogs through such movements of each other would knowingly communicating.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rather, he believes that the dogs learned from experience, to which the movements he must and does not need to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "if you several times with the dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is frequently associated with more friendly manner and move to the right breed less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of this experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings may help the owners of dogs, vets and cvičitelům better understand the emotions of their animals.</seg>
<seg id="17">The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university teacher veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study, which examined whether left and right side is important for dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turning his head to the left, while watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, when looking at a gay dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another of the paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: "the dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when wagging his tail to the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite from the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">The difference may be given to him by the dogs in these various studies of animals in the movies or dog robots nevykládali quite like dogs.</seg>
<seg id="21">He explained, that could help the study of how the dogs respond to real dogs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">But given how easy it is to record their behavior, probably won't be long before we understand why it is their tail sometimes, on the one hand, and on the other.</seg>

<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they will cooperate with the competent authorities on investigations of the world's largest financial market, where the owner of 5.3 trillion changes every day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would have been the first RBS staff suspended as part of the investigation, which is a response to a scandal with the manipulation of the Libor rate (London interbank interest rate).</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank declined to comment on suspension, but confirmed that this month has received a request for information from the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our continuing the search continues in this matter and we have fully cooperated with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, the people who are close to this event, said that RBS had forwarded the British authority of the Financial Conduct records of e-mails and instant messages sent from the accounts and the accounts of the former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">The businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and it is assumed that he had been released from his current position of president of the foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.</seg>

<seg id="13">At least six offices around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss anti-trust office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the US and the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong - is looking into a claim that these bankers partnered to moving with a currency market.</seg>
<seg id="14">People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also triggered an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bank's sweeping years old with quick messages and e-mails to find cases of offences.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report on the investigations startled traders in the area, which has been one of the biggest engines for profit in the investment bank accounts in recent years, but that was disrupted by a currency volatility limited opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers were trying to reduce the severity of the situation, he said that with the vast and highly liquid market with a foreign currency, it is virtually impossible to eradicate, but senior traders say that it may not necessarily be true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite considerable volume of trading in the foreign currency liquidity dismemberment between different trading platforms and banks increasing use their own internal platforms means that "you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The report came on the same day, when the company Credit Suisse announced that this week's release of his department for trading in shares of the trader, which caused the loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.</seg>

<seg id="11">Maybe he will reportedly cost about him, the New York Rangers, who have gone astray entry into the season and, in addition, have wounded two mainstays - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.</seg>
<seg id="12">How's your arrival into the Rangers look like?</seg>
<seg id="13">It's just speculation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until I have something on paper, so it does not address the price.</seg>

<seg id="23">But in New York just similar circumstances arise, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24">The injured man is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team had entering the season, so there is a chance, don't you think?</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, the chance is always.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the second thing is that you always need two parties.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ostravský Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the election, the full ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings of the battle for influence in Ostrava ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="3">It all culminated in that, when the mayor of the city of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned on the court because of undemocratic establishment candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4">The players didn't want the cause is yet to comment too much more damage to the party before the elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the votes of the electorate are numbered.</seg>
<seg id="6">The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD so right on Monday night called the mayor of the city of Ostrava, that emerged from the party, and will probably push to come to his office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Petr Kajnar but wants to fight on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Disputes in terms of what and who is on whose side, described the exclusive interview to the Daily News.</seg>
<seg id="9">How you perceive the outcome of the election?</seg>
<seg id="10">ČSSD must be counted with a much better result.</seg>
<seg id="11">It damaged her with us, that will address the media before the election disputes within the Party?</seg>
<seg id="12">I can imagine that the outcome of the election could have better social democracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on the other hand, it is a condition in which ČSSD now is.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is that the party, which has its own internal problems, is mentally ill and people see it, that all is not well in it.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the election that gave clear.</seg>
<seg id="16">What are you ČSSD internal disease?</seg>
<seg id="17">The decline for some time, to me, is going through the ODS and things like that, unfortunately, now taking place in social democracy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Isn't it, that the lobbyists, influential people, who had previously expected, they find that their prebendy in the ODS, moved to people in ČSSD and have an impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="19">It comes after the Oslo airport offices, then it has to do with the police and collects computers.</seg>
<seg id="20">It shows that the ČSSD is composed of people who would like to think of the good of all the others, but many of them, in particular, for the good of their own.</seg>
<seg id="21">ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps and in Prague, as can be seen even in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is preparing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="23">So, what took place before the elections in Ostrava, was just a precursor of what is happening now in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="24">Haškovo wing gradually obsazovalo position, so that they could make the situation after the elections, which will weaken Sobotkovo wing.</seg>
<seg id="25">A man is in politics in a situation where sometimes must compromise.</seg>
<seg id="26">Each has some internal border, but when you don't compromise, and it is also my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initially, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, so I made a deal with Lubošem Zaorálkem, that will try to get to a regional candidate, has strengthened as the mayor of the city of Ostrava Sobotkovo right wing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Haškovo wing but could stop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why are on the side of the Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michael Haška?</seg>
<seg id="30">Mussels Sobotka to me is a man who always talking mainly about ČSSD and, to some extent, the visions for the party and for the country.</seg>
<seg id="31">I confess that I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="32">Michael Hašek just fighting for power.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don't understand, how can the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the Executive Committee to begin just refer to the President of the party.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the statute of the party.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to me what now Michal Hašek demonstrated in Prague, ended his political career.</seg>
<seg id="36">As you are aware that you Ostrava leadership candidate ČSSD approve.</seg>
<seg id="37">Political parties are based on competition, who are both members of their places.</seg>
<seg id="38">The competition should be, for the most part, based on the programming visions and the ability of the people you meet the vision.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, however, by the competition report as well as people who don't have much ability and vision, but a political party is an elevator to the money for them, which they didn't get elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="40">The problem is, when these people start getting to the forefront because unscrupulous violate the rules violate the statutes of the party.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are doing their practices of the Mafia and the political parties to me that violate the laws of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="42">To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than me to take into account that, if a Kajnar has a political future.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important for the parties to respect the charter.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's why you have passed a motion to the court before the elections for an interim measure against candidates ČSSD form in the Moravian-Silesian region?</seg>
<seg id="45">The current district Executive Committee ČSSD in Ostrava he consolidates his power by the organization, which he does not approve of, can repeal of the new organization is based, gradually firing uncomfortable members of the party.</seg>
<seg id="46">An example of this, however, is that they want to exclude Richard Bednaříka of representatives from the club, but he filed suit against it and then they cancelled the resolution on the exclusion of better.</seg>
<seg id="47">It shows that the parties through the courts to enforce the observance of the constitution is the last option, but at the time when the other ways and control authorities in ČSSD stopped working, it is the only option.</seg>
<seg id="48">The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD effort in the head with a member of Parliament Adam Rykalou's appeal to the position of mayor.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post Poruby Lumír Palyza.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is so, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza is trying to do everything they could appeal to me.</seg>
<seg id="51">They promise to the people of the position, gaining votes and then for the voices of consolidating his power in the party.</seg>
<seg id="52">When I go back to the past, so everything has to be passed around the football club Baník Ostrava and purchase the stadium Bazala, was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was artificially staged, so that I could be described as a man who gives money there, it doesn't belong.</seg>
<seg id="54">The city bought the property, which is strategically valuable to him.</seg>
<seg id="55">How do you see it on with his remaining in office Mayor?</seg>
<seg id="56">The district committee had invited me and some other people on Monday to consider their continued presence in ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="57">I think that is so, as when a thief crying: Catch a thief!</seg>
<seg id="58">When we look at the results of my work over the past 11 years, so I don't see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and pushed forward, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, such as industrial zones or extensions are the park.</seg>
<seg id="59">Yet all I become uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="60">Don't read it in a different way than that in the way the others piled on the place, after which he covets.</seg>
<seg id="61">You will fight against these efforts have somehow?</seg>
<seg id="62">Because if this one is the Republic work well, as political parties must also work well.</seg>
<seg id="63">I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state, when he can't drive or herself.</seg>
<seg id="64">Acknowledge, therefore, that I have now left the ČSSD, because I think this side, I'm not the one who causes cancer, but these people who are trying to drive me.</seg>

<seg id="21">Calls from mobile phones will be on board to continue to be banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify the FAA, but the American Federal Committee for telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="23">The FAA may in some electronic devices during take-off and landing to repeal the ban.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mark Rosenker last month from the National Safety Committee in transport, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Mobile phones are really the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with the navigational instruments, but we also know that in the air may cause interference from the FCC data transmission towers," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Trade advisory committee created by the FAA, therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the government would allow wider use of electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">The FAA has in recent years come under pressure to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskillová, a Democrat from Missouri, argues that there is no legitimate security reasons for the ban.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce, because of the use of such devices is ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies suggest that up to a third passenger forgets to turn off their devices or ignores her.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio, technical achievement of the times.</seg>
<seg id="32">The new airlines are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but the aircraft are also designed and approved by the FAA, that was resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">The airline has already offered to passengers after several years of use of Wi-Fi in travel altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="34">The plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to jamming.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of the airlines should adapt to the new rules for the greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová.</seg>
<seg id="36">The current electronic devices generally emit radio broadcasts, much less intense than it was in the previous generation facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">The electronic reader, for example, issued only a minimum broadcasting in turning the page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But the broadcast is stronger when they withdrew the device or transmitting data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those who are pushing for it to relax restrictions on the use of such devices by passengers, is.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011 the company representatives loaded airliner its Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.</seg>
<seg id="41">The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real, and that, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots, to support the fact that such devices can cause interference of air systems, and most of these reports is very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allowed pilots ordered passengers off the device during instrument flying at low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, according to her on a sensible approach for the travelling public, that the technology used in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that it is not a pleasant travel experience in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, the Executive Director of the American travel associations.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ivan grew up and spent much of his life in the apartment house with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague vilových Ořechovce neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="3">The original owners of the house but it gained back in restitution and tenants had to move on with a small severance.</seg>

<seg id="5">From known got a tip on a flat 3+kk in older panelovém house on the other side of the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"At first it was a shock, but the sight of the fourth floor of the massive dam and a forest park thrills me on the other side," says Ivan on first impression.</seg>
<seg id="7">At first I thought it would be a stopgap that for three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today we live here more than 13 years, and not only because of the gradual reconstruction would remain unchanged," adds the owner.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mother and daughter had migrated from stodvacetimetrového apartment into smaller with an area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment only.</seg>
<seg id="10">The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual arranging took almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">A new apartment was in pretty good shape, but had to take place the necessary adjustments, such as painting doors or windows exchange.</seg>
<seg id="12">The previous owner he resented the core, but the most inconvenient or and unnecessarily large hall, and, on the contrary, a small bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">The merger of the two rooms of a multifunctional living space.</seg>
<seg id="14">The architects used for the demarcation of the zones and the layout of the room drywall, allowing the new lights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first shot, to which, after a few years, she was the removal of the bars in the living room.</seg>
<seg id="16">The apartment 2+kk disposition may have changed, but the room has received the airiness and opened with a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.</seg>
<seg id="17">The next step was to a partial improvement of the standard compensation for PVC laminate flooring.</seg>

<seg id="28">In the context of the show how to build a dream was quick, but the fundamental change in the living room, which also owns the architect Martin Čeněk.</seg>
<seg id="29">The area, which was created by a combination of the two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without the help of the classical principles of optical division, for example polopříčkami or Japanese walls.</seg>
<seg id="30">"That in turn would violate the openness and the unity of the space," explains architect.</seg>

<seg id="32">That was enough to bring back two sofas and build on the peace between them produced box on the covers.</seg>

<seg id="43">Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.</seg>
<seg id="44">In contrast new interior předělaném works well with older, for example, with dozens of years old crystal chandelier and Ivan with high-quality works of art, which collects all his life.</seg>
<seg id="45">The last of the series came in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cabinet and the owner have previously been deployed on both sides have felt a little bit like in the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="47">Architect target their number and přeskládala deployment.</seg>
<seg id="48">The furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface but slightly pearly surface.</seg>

<seg id="2">One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over US consular office in Frankfurt, the main town of the German economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to get a photo of the roof of the American outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German media claims that the BFV had hoped that this action will be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and launched the Berlin exchange of views between American and German Foreign Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, in September again insisted that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities," that stole trade secrets of foreign companies in favour of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, who became an informer of a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of the secret monitoring of the United States, European governments and business leaders do not know if they believe the words of the director.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the news that the U.S. National Security Agency conducted espionage in the Brazilian oil company and has access to the data, with whom they have American cloudoví providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about government monitoring of new dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last straw came with the revelation that maybe ten years, Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was tapped.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the target may be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly a potential target, as well as business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden zprůhlednil intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would say that it is possible that the data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün BITMi, president of the society, which represents small and medium-sized companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a survey issued in July advisory service EY are convinced that the German company in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now represents as great a risk as China.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents disclosed by Mr Snowdenem, however, so far there is no evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU is missing some skills in the field of IT and the Internet, and argued that they should seek to reduce their dependence on the US:</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are skeptical of it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The voices of the German Parliament, that we should make the German Google.</seg>

<seg id="23">The scope and the technical maturity of US intelligence agencies detected Snowdenem is for some companies, who are now believed that the biggest threat from China is monitoring, still shocking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big turnover in cloudové computing, where European leaders in a wider scope to recognize that the data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction, and therefore are potentially irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the survey carried out by the business community cloud security alliance neamerických about 10 percent of the members of the revelation of the US Prism programme on data mining cancelled plans to use cloudového provider based in the US.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, SAP one of CEOs, says: "We have a new question for customers, that wasn't there a year ago - where are my data stored in this jurisdiction, and you can guarantee they stay physically?"</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of the senior German officials argue that recent reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: That powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic espionage is carried out, it is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is always happening.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's a major issue for many years and has significantly changed that even during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the agrochemical company BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level, just as we are conducting spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">The company is generally do not want to boast protiopatřeními, which made, so that, if necessary, did not provide an advantage to the attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of large companies have long been recalls that take on the trade fair, free of charge, a USB memory drive or left unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automakers Audi, says that it is common practice for many years gathering before the meeting of the Board of Directors of mobile phones, so that they could not be used as a listening device.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German office BFV directors direct, to consider whether the use of foreign guests simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk that smart phones can compromise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could for life to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the tests on people's need to carry out further tests, which take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York, says that the first indications are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"firmly hope that this kind of vaccine strategy may finally help to millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that, all the current approaches to overcome," said Professor Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was set up so that carried the genetic information for the creation of a antinikotinových antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to create a continuous stream of these antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt all nicotine molecules in the blood stream and neutralise them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing a smoker of nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests of the vaccinated mice, which was subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the mice that were not vaccinated," the calm," said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine they got into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">The previous tobacco vaccine failed because it contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The injections would be administered so often, in order to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so have proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because of liver cells to convert the factory to the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Crystal said that if the vaccine for the people of the future will be completely safe, they could be given to children before they will be tempted to try a cigarette, and to prevent that nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine will have no benefit from it, and it will help them get rid of the bad habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.</seg>

<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris the second year studying medicine at Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="7">In those days I read a book so sad.</seg>
<seg id="8">I thought about this book, that inspires me during the grim days of my second year in medical school and restore a modicum of hope in me.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win" (waltzing to victory) and memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the evening finish reports of patients and I'm going to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches will take your breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">The elections are over overwhelming and television news forced us to consider the historical value of this moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates wept with joy and my parents have kept the paper, which got.</seg>
<seg id="13">The young team headed to the White House visionaries and the nation was ready for a change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the office in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">And here the book closing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Go to the present there is harsh awakening, as talk of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is hard to remember these optimistic days - seem distant memories, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years after I threw my first election ticket, really has to change.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was certainly nothing from what I imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I acknowledge that Obama has reached a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law on the care available through the evacuation of our troops out of Iraq and end the policy of "don't ask, to say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, I believe, partisan obstruction reverse so many efforts to move our nation forward: Among other is that immigration reform, the public option to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu.</seg>
<seg id="22">But in many situations, when I was in front of colleagues and friends said the Obama administration, I, as regards the explanation, which can provide, came to the absolute limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">I found myself in the place of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obstruction for Republican Spain cannot explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders with drones raids that kill innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot be explained by them, that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that haunts those who reveal improper conduct of the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot be held responsible for the execution of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlakího without proper court even for reducing public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="27">The findings of the report, which cannot be justified by them, he says, that the White House efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And most recently cannot excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the available care simple Web pages.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know whether to expect something like that.</seg>
<seg id="30">If I had known in 18 years, that the government's power may be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.</seg>
<seg id="31">An elected office apparently does not have a predictable pattern and the opposition political party will shape our public talks and random events, such as the massacre in Newton.</seg>
<seg id="32">But all the examples that I mentioned above, is to a large extent appear to be the result of the administration's decision.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that worries me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">Obama voted again in 2012, but not because I was excited for his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney represented zmatečnou and nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be able to consolidate its policy or position.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, of which we have heard once.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yet it is a return to 2008 - with it, how to support Obama this week dropped by 45% - through this book increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me remember that a number of promises, which had vanished.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat in the primaries in Pennsylvania, with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the meeting, his staff said during the campaign that he needs to get back into a rhythm and remain faithful to their mission.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want to get back our magic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must not lose sight of who we are.</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is running one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Today we are witnessing landmark: Construction began on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline project, the largest and most important in Europe," Gazprom president Alexei Miller said in its statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the Russian export routes across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Once the project begins its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline for a reduced rate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Advanced earlier</seg>
<seg id="2">The research showed that Afroameričanky and Hispánky are reaching puberty earlier than their Caucasian contours.</seg>
<seg id="3">The physical changes do not mean that the approaching adolescence</seg>
<seg id="4">It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts say one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend is not so evident earlier puberty for boys.</seg>
<seg id="7">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should the mother zděsit, when her daughter will start to grow breasts and pubic hair at the groin at 7 or 8 years?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American College of Surgeons explained this week in Orlando, Florida pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spent a lot of time, that I am assured parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid development in the direction of a teenager," Kaplowitz said</seg>
<seg id="11">Visible signs of development, such as the growth of their breasts, hair at the groin and armpits and body odor, the girls have previously.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last forty years he was, however, just a small shift in the age of the first period.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to age 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you start to develop breasts, expire at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Early puberty in girls: Essential guide to tackle this growing problem)</seg>
<seg id="15">The most reliable test of how puberty will continue, it's time.</seg>
<seg id="16">The debate about what makes a real start puberty, but if the breast growth is accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 year old girl is considered "prematurely mature."</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases the process slows or stops - which may paediatric doctors closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="18">Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to run tests to exclude the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: Premature ageing bones, which can ultimately lead to a halt of growth and dwarfism in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recommendations are dependent on drugs and hormone treatment at the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosociologické aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">As regards the deployment of medicines, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty may alleviate the problems with the conduct of the girl and her feelings, that is different from their peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to have their very young daughters periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I do worry that they may become pregnant, or how it will handle the hygiene," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," says one woman, whose daughter began to have menstrual periods in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, was not prepared emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school frightened and angry, that is the first of his friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are a number of well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Still, however, there is a file of evidence, that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">The boys as girls are reaching puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the reason for this is the most serious epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2001 helped with the study is carried out on girls aged from 6 to 9 years, which connects with the timing of puberty of body fat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country and Hispánky Afroameričanky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">The explanations are various.</seg>
<seg id="36">From a global perspective, it seems that the designs of the early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions over the climate after the genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another puzzle: Although for boys are already at a young age appears hair on the face and in the groin, a trend toward full bloom early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors participating in a conference of the American Association of pediatric doctors (AAP) added more complexity to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Acne and hair groin is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We have to be careful, as to how to identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey Goryebské.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get from your doctor's instructions on how to talk with your child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean that we need to talk with the child sooner than you expected," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you stay calm, your child is likely to be responding well.</seg>
<seg id="44">The girls, who are evolving, they need the assurance that, even if it is premature, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in Australia for the time being in force</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smart phones during the launching and landing without regard to changes in the US for a relaxation of the rules in relation to these devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave space for American companies to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games on its facilities during critical phases of flight, when the device will remain in the "air" scheme.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers already can do this during most of the flight, but many people poisoned, that they cannot have access to electronic books during takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Australian carrier from American carriers are exploring this decision, which requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change its practice soon.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also examined the announcement, he said, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Casa currently has no specific rules regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The question is covered by the regulations, which require aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with security guidelines, which will receive from the crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company Virgin, which already with CASA talked about expanding the use of its in-flight entertainment system wi-fi, was in favour of change, but announced that it will be subjected to the decision of the regulatory authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We welcome, if the CASA conducted an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would be now, when we have (wireless in-flight entertainment), improved customer experiences," the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas announced that, for the time being, I will stick to the current regulations.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention to change in the near future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">But we are interested in the developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and be sure to thoroughly study the FAA decision and the reasons are behind him.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the case of air carriers from the US company with the impact of the rules will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, and also to review the manuals, training materials, programs for carry-on baggage and passenger information.</seg>
<seg id="17">"as soon as the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, passengers can afford to use electronic devices, such as tablets, light and portable electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude," the FAA said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A fantastic movie from the universe of gravity vyprodával some time after the premiere of the movie in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">In October saw him under the Union's film distributors almost 150,000 spectators and earned over 26 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of the reviews of the slide in a positive light.</seg>
<seg id="5">Other things in it, however, is located some inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists on it, how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense, which appeared in the film.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jiří Dušek (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Brno): I like science-fiction movies, which I consider to be modern, dreamlike fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="8">The film gravity included, even though he faces as "physically real" show.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not, but that does not mean that he was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="10">I've enjoyed it very much.</seg>
<seg id="11">See you can be Sandra Bullock's hair, which is sort of raises in microgravity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hubbův space telescope and the International Space Station move after significantly different orbits, therefore, cannot be seen in one frame.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some viewers of the film about unrealistically active effect and all of the behavior of fire in weightlessness.</seg>
<seg id="14">The suits would also hold such wounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">The heroes in the film gravity is often come into conflict with various objects and suits without much trouble all last.</seg>
<seg id="16">The criticism has not been spared either the plotline.</seg>
<seg id="17">So much tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is unrealistic, according to some people.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair technique.</seg>
<seg id="19">The people on the forums arguing about the "unrealistic" behaviour ropes.</seg>
<seg id="20">She said work, as if it was intended for bungee jumping.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marcel Grün (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Prague): I saw him just yet on a broad canvas, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm glad it wasn't a film documentary, but science- fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">And in this story the author has the right (almost an obligation) made the consistently reality.</seg>
<seg id="24">"More than you mention irregularities, it struck me, as it is displayed three times the space station to downgrade the level of technology (last Chinese)."</seg>
<seg id="25">"China will be until the end of the decade and probably will look better than it is in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="26">Vladimir Karas (Astronomického, director of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer generated scenes are very successfully trying to leave the authors of the laws of physics, and so přírodovědně oriented audience appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and precipitation quite rightly observes the angular momentum, said the dictionary physics, also look at Earth from space is very realistic including thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering on the polar regions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The discrepancies will surely find the details.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, for example, in reading the comments I found that the preferred direction circulation of space debris in orbit seems to be turned in some scenes, than it should in fact be (from west to east).</seg>
<seg id="29">Jiří Štěpán (Astronomického employee of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things you makers have adapted to their needs, but no major and blatant transgression against logic or the laws of nature in the film, I notice and in comparison with other films like the focus is to see, given that the makers depend on the credibility of the event.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of those moments that don't make sense is worth it to the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than ISS.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result is considerably different mutual speed and a rescue operation would therefore, in fact, could not take place as shown in the film.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then at the moment of separation of Stone and Kowalski (Clooney) (Bullock) I noticed that all the ISS was rotating, therefore it is not even clear the origin of the force to try, which makes both players to let go of the moment is already against each other at a standstill.</seg>

<seg id="3">Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any data on air test for its new CSeries aircraft, even offering up-to-date information, as to whether the plane would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.</seg>

<seg id="12">The number of binding orders the CSeries aircraft, however, is modest 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claim on the consumption and low savings on the cost of transport aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected when the first plane into commercial use will reach their goal by Bombardier 300 binding orders.</seg>
<seg id="15">The executives also on Thursday assured analysts and the media, that the program is proceeding according to plan.</seg>

<seg id="17">Each manufacturer is planned to be otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the update and we did that.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will happen during the entire flight programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Bombardier, the second of five test planes should fly in the coming weeks and the other not long after.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are still skeptical of it, that would be the first customer could begin to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier claims to evaluate his plan of the aircraft in service and in the coming months will provide updated information.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with the internal plan Bombardier - probably will reinforce our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of the year 2015," Doerksen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year's net profit fell in the third quarter ending September 30 Bombardier to $147 million, or 8 cents per share.</seg>

<seg id="29">Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.</seg>
<seg id="30">Outstanding contracts in aviation division accounted for 30 September 32.9 billion, which is not even on 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="31">The results were in line with our forecasts, but the low income in aviation orders and the overall state of the market failed us," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">The yield fell by 13 percent to $2 billion in the aviation industry.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, said that revenue in the division rose almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
