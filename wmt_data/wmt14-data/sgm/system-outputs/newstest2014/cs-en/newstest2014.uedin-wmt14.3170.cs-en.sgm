<seg id="1">Egypt in the office of the first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Muhammad Mursí folded the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day hard to close the political unrest in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Islamista Muhammad Mursí promised a "new Egypt," when he was formally sworn into office as the first freely elected president of the country after Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed by 16 months earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took an oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes in the mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Usilujeme a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," he said in a solemn ceremony Mursí fhat live on national television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been for most of the 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization, the target of fierce attacks by individual governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Mursí shortly after 11 p.m. local time arrived in a small convoy of cars, guarded the building hundreds of soldiers and police officers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's office was only briefly stopped traffic to pass the column usually a busy road linking the city centre to the suburbs to the south.</seg>
<seg id="10">Personal prestige Mursího, derisively known as necharismatická "spare tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has risen sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which was designed to present him as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who want to lead to the end of the revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursí, dressed in a blue jacket with a red tie judges in the wood-paneled chamber, where he took the oath.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mursí later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to deliver the inaugural speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">While he stood at attention, received an official welcome from the military band, which played the national anthem.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was a military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was accompanied by with chants of "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main auditorium of the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">The university in Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s, has become a bastion of the Islamic student movement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mursí took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed that he grabs the presidential powers taken from his office, the military council that took over from the misery of the leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the approval of the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he acceded to the will of the army, which suggests that the power struggle will continue.</seg>

<seg id="3">To this end, we have entered the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we were the leading British businessmen asked about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing the British businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU states have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see how the government prefers the new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil to mired in a long and laborious process of reforming the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When we asked for their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations after the laws on products - the majority of entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Panovala general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area - even 40 percent expressed approval of large enterprises, which is traditionally the most pro-European companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, our survey of leading companies revealed that the most impressive knowledge that a clear majority wants Britain sought to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">The findings, which assume ownership of companies of various sizes and major business groups, shows that the business sector is pushing for "meaningful change," which will take effect back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high-achieving changes to the treaty and a better deal for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% of the vote in a referendum to stay in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should not hesitate: This survey shows that the British trade supports his plan for reform of the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that the business sector expects that this reform will mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back toward Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for Britain is possible, given the way the eurozone is on the way for closer economic and fiscal union, and increasingly necessary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority has to be jobs and growth in Britain and, as shown by the results of our survey, for a business that is re-focusing on trade and fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">The British government announced a study, which aims to increase the benefits of the rail project, HS2 for Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work of HS2 suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will start as soon as the first stage in the year 2026 starts.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will join the United Kingdom together."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said that he was working with the British government on this plan, "enthusiastic."</seg>
<seg id="5">The first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of the Phase Two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from 32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The British government, which has led talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, the company has commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This includes the possibility of any travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better linking Britain and its cities."</seg>
<seg id="11">We gave SH2 green, because the benefits it will bring, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it is also the link - across Great Britain will be better connected to HS2 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish Government Keith Brown, Mr Carmichael said to "strongly" supported the Scottish integration into the network of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">With enthusiasm, we are working with the British government to explore options to bring high speed rail to Scotland and to bring all the benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, along with British ministers during the next year and a joint decision-making on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines is preparing to charge for carry-on luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge during his years in the amount of up to $100 for a carry-on baggage on board.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines is planning to introduce a fee of up to $100 for a carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all the can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee for carry-on luggage on the luggage in the upper storage space, so a small bag under the seat will remain free.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee has been paid in advance and $100 if they are paying passengers to wait until the arrival of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spokesman of the Frontier Kate O'Malley, listen stated that stodolarový fee is to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We neradi chose this charge," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The airlines have begun to charge the first and second brought luggage in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers tried to avoid the charges and poured into the cabin luggage hidden in the storage space, as close as they could, so often lacking in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one of the ways of the passengers to learn to take fewer things on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley, listen said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.</seg>
<seg id="12">The point is that the most loyal customers of the Frontier is clearly expressed that to find a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who bought tickets on the website of the company, will not pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that one passenger in line at the gate of the Frontier can bring baggage, which does not pay anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same baggage will pay $100.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley, listen said that the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before their arrival at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new fee of Frontier for carry-on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer, but the date has not been set yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often on the fees for baggage and other fees are complaining, but the airline is love.</seg>
<seg id="18">He argues that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who are demanding this service, would have to pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street see a further charge for baggage as a sign that the airline is trying to collect enough money to cover the cost of air operations after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">But most of the fees for carry-on luggage did not rise.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Company Spirit Airlines as the first zpoplatnila hand luggage three years ago and other low cost airline Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only company that has such charges, is Hungary's Wizz Air, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.</seg>
<seg id="23">In its report in December 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage company Spirit will bring $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and perplexed by what he saw at the gate, when he met with an unusual charge of Spirit's carry-on luggage.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Nastupování into the aircraft was the smoothest I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see at the gate gnashing of teeth and quarrels.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and the onset of in an instant."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also along the lines of the company Spirit exercises fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, may retain all the cans and coffee will be free upgrades.</seg>
<seg id="30">The water will continue to be free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">Us Airways, the company in 2008 briefly tried to introduce fees for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later, and no other major airline nenapodobila it.</seg>
<seg id="32">The last move of the Frontier charge for carry-on luggage, if the consumer does not purchase years directly from the airline, is her last attempt to go directly to customers on its website.</seg>
<seg id="33">The airlines are online travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">This gave rise to all airlines to keep passengers to buy directly from them rather than do it through online travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="35">The company Frontier, however, went furthest in this area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September, she began to give customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half miles in the frequent flyer program.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday, ořízla reward for flier miles to 25 percent of the miles of the road.</seg>
<seg id="38">So the way companies Frontier long 1000 miles purchased over the Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">Zákazníkům also allows the company to choose their seat in advance only in the event that the purchase will be made directly through the company's website, Frontier.</seg>
<seg id="40">The company Frontier has in his home town of Denver loyal base of customers, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the financial results given in the center of the corporate partner of the Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter has shrunk by almost 13 percent</seg>
<seg id="42">The Republic, the sale of the airline is trying to solve the financial problems of the company Frontier.</seg>

<seg id="3">In November last year, the analysis caught over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 200 were published in the daily newspaper and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for publishing offers of employment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even in 2005, when the survey was carried out for the first time, his share of 26 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) has stabilised at around 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advertising job opportunities, according to the analysis largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="8">An example would be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and at a time of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, in 2007, was in the same reference period published nearly 25 900 advertisements in 2012, it was less than half.</seg>
<seg id="10">The offer jobs on the Internet is geared towards closer, especially more qualified group of professions.</seg>
<seg id="11">By contrast, the job offers in the daily newspaper covers a wider range of professions, including those working-class, the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.</seg>
<seg id="12">The level of representation of professional groups in both the media is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the Internet have taken the place of advertisements seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.</seg>
<seg id="14">The position of programmers or leading small businesses acted only on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the daily newspaper's share of these skilled significantly lower, on the other hand, a large representation include, in particular, the service and blue-collar professions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among the most commonly reported requirements that employers expressed through advertising offers, including, of course, education.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other areas belonged to the knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the daily newspaper was a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language included in three percent of advertisements on the Internet at 37 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only two percent of the ads employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Claims on the 'computer literacy "appeared in 40 percent of the ads in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads.</seg>
<seg id="22">Requirements for the practice are generally associated with qualified professionals.</seg>
<seg id="23">In particular, the head of production and other executives.</seg>
<seg id="24">In particular, the blue-collar mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or a repairman electrical appliances, said study author George Tillner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employers also in the middle of their ads show the requirements for the qualities and skills of potential bidders.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is clear from the data, real estate consultancy company Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Prague's Bohnice opens to the public Shopping Centre Krakow, will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neuspokojivý performance concerns about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main problems are inappropriately large centre on the site, and bad layouty, too much floors or complicated and obscure arrangement passages, or dead space center, "said Michael Sotak from the company Cushman & Wakefield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, according to the head of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samadi, about one-fifth of the trade center struggling with low attendance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among the main reasons include, among other things, bad traffic accessibility, low income categories of local residents, or an overcapacity in the market place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nowadays, the customers are somewhat conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new business centres must try harder 'lure' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, service and marketing events, "Samadi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The shopping malls, according to Sotáka generally stable, even in some centres is rising, because landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some units.</seg>
<seg id="13">"But it is true that recently opened some projects that are not fully occupied, and thus reduce the average occupancy rate (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava Šantovka in Olomouc)," Sotak said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shopping malls open in the past two years to promote the market, according to Sylvia Samadi, very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Place in the market for new projects, but it exists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of jobs suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, in Prague, we see scope for the construction of the project, which would serve the people of Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="18">Certainly there is room for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called "convinience centres', focusing on everyday purchases and services for people living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, according to Sotáka exists in the domestic market place for other shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="20">And for a small 'service' centers, as well as for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Sotak said.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Prague, he sees room for the upcoming Trade Center to Champion Square, also have the potential to clear the street Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Intenzivně develops expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller and smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or a neighborhood shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of commercial houses Prior benefiting from good locations," said Dita Kubánková from the company DTZ.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers, with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross pronajímatelných surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of all these shopping centres is located in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, stems from the data the company INCOMA GfK.</seg>
<seg id="27">In a number of shopping parks is the Czech Republic below the EU average, compared with those of Britain and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic of about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="6">The potential change was a closely-guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only a few of the president's closest advisers - including Daleyho, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former main advisers in the White House, David Axelroda and David Plouffeho - known to be considering the change.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book "Double down," says Daley was a leader of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until he finally decided not to implement this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket, "Obama's chances did not increase significantly."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I intenzivně examined a wide range of things, and this was one of them," said a letter to Daley.</seg>
<seg id="11">You must remember that at the time he was president of the grim prospects, so we thought: 'Christ, what are we supposed to do? "</seg>

<seg id="17">Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not respond to the question of whether the political probe got up to Obama on the table.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he really thought that Obama did not know about the research on Biden's removal from the list.</seg>

<seg id="15">Podnětem is the fact that the Road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at the gas stations, is at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars travel much more miles per gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of the current high price of gasoline, the politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by only one cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test the system of paying for the kilometre travelled.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In the long term, it seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Experts call it a user fee, according to the mileage.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals, because taxes can be used to alter the pattern of behaviour of drivers, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and the creation of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="25">Kalifornští designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious laws on global warming.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Republican Representative Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said that it also sees as workable as possible long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The leaders of the free market, from the Reason Foundation are also keen on the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not a tax that will disappear into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organisation of Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paid directly for what they are.</seg>
<seg id="30">The initiative also is supported by two former American transport ministers, who urged Congress in 2011, to go towards paying for half a mile.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate last year approved a pilot project for $90 million, which should include about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and has done so for fear of rural legislators representing the components of the population whose day-to-day life often means to offend many miles to work outside the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities, however, is moving forward on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nejhorlivější is Oregon, which included the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon begin to the state to pay the tax for the distance travelled, instead of taxes on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York is examining the project.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is attempting to a limited extent in the trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 of the ministries of transport, together with the eastern coastal states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.</seg>
<seg id="40">This concept, however, is not only a champion.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where the device was recently fitted with about 50 cars volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government is able to follow their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about the monitoring of the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the management strategy and operations at the Ministry of Transport officials.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something that people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As a pilot project, he continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn the device into a full-fledged tracking device."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build a huge unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably spread to the daily trips and the arrival of individuals.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among the few countries that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many miles of driving the car, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do it, "said Khan, the public will be calmer.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has brought some state agencies to small companies in California called True Mileage (the actual distance travelled).</seg>
<seg id="49">The company originally into action to help the government in the taxation of drivers were not involved.</seg>
<seg id="50">She wanted to break into the emerging market for civil liability, where drivers would be paid on the basis of how many drives.</seg>
<seg id="51">But this device is tested, attracts the attention of the developers of the road network, because it does not use GPS and adds only a limited amount of information that are regularly recorded using a modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to go, if you haven't been following their speed and their position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">In some of these pilot programs, a series of major errors.</seg>
<seg id="54">They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon designers has experimented with the fact that they give drivers a choice.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose the GPS device with or without a GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or does not need to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee, based on the average mileage of all the people of the state.</seg>
<seg id="58">In other places in the hope that the public continues on this concept will proceed if the device will be able to more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the city of New York, transportation officials are trying to develop the device, which would be equipped to be able to pay extra fees for parking hours to provide insurance, according to the vehicle kilometres and gathering data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid the traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the design document city.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, however, would like to know whether any discussion about paying for a kilometre is not just a giant with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="62">Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area, say that Congress might have a problem with the bankrupt silničním Trust Fund very easily solved by increasing the tax on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Single or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars, they do not consume a lot of fuel, so that they will have to pay a fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for any radical surgery, it's enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a lot of other things.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the operator O2.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two companies confirmed the talks, according to various sources of agencies and from behind the scenes is said to have a hand in the sleeve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the transaction should come back in November, probably before the start of the auction frequencies for LTE network, before 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kellnerův competitor Karel Komarek KKCG own group.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is under the brand Sazka Telecommunications embarked on auction frequencies for LTE network.</seg>
<seg id="7">And to everyone's surprise, in the meantime, the taste of the telecommunications firms to penetrate.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunications man Robert Chvatal.</seg>
<seg id="9">He started as a marketing chief of RadioMobil (now T-Mobile), eventually becoming director of the Slovak T-Mobile and the last time was in charge of the Austrian branch of the same operator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sazka plays just a few cards at once.</seg>
<seg id="11">Přihlásila the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for Vodafone virtuála.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it succeeds in the auction, so he will be able to move into its network of existing customers from its virtual operator.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would normally like Vodafone, but according to the information, the newspaper that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between the competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will be fully share their networks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vodafone it needs a partner.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it may be just Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="18">If it succeeds in the tender for LTE Network (as a freshman, specially designed to auction spectrum) and Vodafone, the auction may not go at all, and he won't mind auctioning only limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).</seg>
<seg id="19">Vodafone, the Sazkou can share the network.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vodafone drops Sazka into its 2G / 3G Network (or newly built LTE network on the frequency of 900 MHz), which will allow the company to kick-start the network.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sazka between starts to build costly LTE network, which will be able to use and Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="22">Spokojeny may be both companies.</seg>
<seg id="23">Vodafone uspořené money would then be able to spend on a fixed Internet providers or cable TV.</seg>
<seg id="24">And Kellner?</seg>
<seg id="25">That would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovakian branch is the daughter of a Czech) immediately gained a full operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the other hand, it is a big juggernaut, which will wait for the restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the auction would gain Kellner's LTE network for the O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="28">The two companies already had declared that the network will be shared.</seg>
<seg id="29">The auction could finally be a success, but probably not enough with high amounts of the national budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic can choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellnerem or Komárkem.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama is backing away from the health care</seg>
<seg id="2">After a wave of criticism of President Obama yesterday stepped away from his often repeated and an ambitious promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With reference to the hundreds of thousands of testimonies from the providers of the Republicans in recent days, accused the president of misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama from his original promise flinched.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">With regard to what he called "rumors" in the media about the testimonies, Obama called on Americans who have received the notification, to search for new safeguards on the market.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even more cheaply than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You'll get a better offer," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">His administration has argued that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population, which buy insurance for itself, it may be forced to change the program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Law on the affordable care.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I say that these Americans on the plane: You deserve something better," Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the affordable care, said that the launch of the online market since October was "miserable."</seg>

<seg id="13">I'll try to get back your confidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Annoyed Sebelius this sentence, which caught the mike, said yesterday in the direction of the advisors seated behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which was held after a heated quarrel as taking a Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, which involved whether she must also engage in Obama's healthcare program.</seg>
<seg id="15">For more than three hours during a hearing at Sebeliusovou repeatedly asked the question of why the "architect" of the affordable care voluntarily gave up a government-sponsored insurance, and nezakoupil a program through the HealthCare.gov, which is now forcing millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to the villages in Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team treated almost every weekend, hundreds of patients,</seg>
<seg id="4">In the West African countries, is not too many doctors; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vote here, or through their mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 major candidates for the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the competition for the price of CNN Heroes of 2013, you can vote for him, or for any of the 10 leading candidates.</seg>
<seg id="8">Výherce receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father again and again lapsing into unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was in 1981, near the capital city of Yaounde Cameroon injured in a car crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first he was cured only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that has spread to the brain, and there has created a hematoma, which caused him problems all his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"In Cameroon were no neurosurgeons," says Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">We'd have to take him out of Cameroon, if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years by his father was carrying to the crowded clinics and hospitals, where he received a treatment that was available.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave the house at five in the morning, to rush to the hospital to get there first, but you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people are dying because they must wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since 2002, when Bwelleho father died, the situation has not changed too much.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the World Health Organization in Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor at 413 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if the doctor could visit the Cameroonians, many would couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care in this country are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem that they have is poverty," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">With due to poverty, we cannot take his life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bwelle when he saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers had done last year, free 700 operations.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="29">And ASCOVIME founded a non-profit organization whose members on the weekend visit rural areas, where they provide medical care for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people napěchuje to supply, attached to the roof of medical supplies and travel rough terrain to the villages that need help.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is not always accompanied by luck.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once, the vehicle must push through the river and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as the real heroes: Feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willingly engaged in a local amusement.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next day, the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We have 500 patients on each trip," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">They come to the village from a range of 60 kilometers, and on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">During each of these weekends doctors provide different medical aid.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parazitními diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others may get the crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free - a document that calls for the school, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening, the team is doing under the local anaesthetics simple operation.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operation is usually do in the school at the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to zotavovacího places to make room for the next patient.</seg>
<seg id="44">For using the light from a generator, an operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers are working into the early morning hours.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually team will help to keep his motivation.</seg>
<seg id="46">"To stay awake and continued to work, play the drums all night," Bwelle says.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of his work.</seg>
<seg id="48">This group - consisting of Cameroon's foreign doctors and medical students - carried out last year, 700 free operations and is aware that their aid can mean a lot for local residents.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man said that after a hernia operation will be able to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"It will change the future of our family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to organizing the following weekend clinics and work as a surgeon in the hospital at night Bwelle also works for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">He says that this second work financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure exactly when sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, listen to the second year studying medicine at the University of Drexelově in Philadelphia and worked as a volunteer for the Bwelleovu group.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is always either in the hospital or trying to get money for the organization that these campaigns could do.</seg>
<seg id="55">For students of medicine and nursing services, such as O'Malley, listen, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelleovi on his mission, it's a great experience, which would gain at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Dr. Bwellemu we they washed his hands thoroughly and remove stains, or we kept his tools," says O'Malley, listen.</seg>
<seg id="57">This as a medical student in the second year in America never experience.</seg>

<seg id="1">With the growing poverty middle class are experiencing a pawnshop in Singapore to flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">In a pawn shop in a shopping centre in Singapore stops Bendemeer Janani Amirthalingaová gold bracelet, ring and earrings to her daughter to pay tuition.</seg>
<seg id="3">"With my husband, we just bought a house, and I put all my money on it," says Ms Amirthalingaová.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although each month as CEO gets 2400 dollars (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, he says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Demand across the areas in Southeast Asia - where the increased household debt - is indeed that the company of ValueMax, where a woman carries out its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop on the stock market in Singapore on the ladder.</seg>
<seg id="6">Stopping jewellery is not just a quick way to borrow the cash - 1300 SGD, in the case of Mrs Amirthalingaové - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Zastavárny in Singapore normally applied the annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15,4procentní rate offered by the Bank, United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zastavárny, however, have the advantage that do not require verification of the person (the history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than the banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so, as families are feeling the pressure because of the increasing cost of living and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low-and middle-income families are turning to the pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly because of the increasing nájmům as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of the Asian banks.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are due to the gross domestic product, the highest household debt in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia is at the head of the rankings, with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just received this week from a technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, the data showed continuing weak exports and a decline in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bottom line is that the rising cost of people from high to low-income scale [] will try to supplement their income, wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically, the high price of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people quickly stop their personal property and use the opportunity to exchange for cash their family jewels.</seg>
<seg id="18">About 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 urban zastavárnách consists of gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People say: The price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and we'll get him back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">The largest operator of pawn shops in Thailand, EasyMoney, noted in recent months to 20procentní an increase in the number of customers using its pawn shop.</seg>
<seg id="21">Growth in the sector zastavárenském is so large that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, is planning to expand, not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says executive director ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will finance the use of 60 percent of the 66 million SGD, which gained this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some of the discount creditors came under fire of criticism because of the high interest, Mrs. Yeah says that the pledge offers not only a lower rate than other creditors, but it also directly does not increase the debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers stop objects, which already owns, and the realisation of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the company's pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure the short-term, secure financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among those who use the pawnshop, moreover, are not the only people in financial distress.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bohatí people from Singapore also use the branch of ValueMax, when calling gold bars or a Rolex watch, and so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">Our customers are from all sorts of circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="29">"These include wealthy individuals who are in need of a short-term loan for his courageous shops or investments, or small businesses that need help in solving the problems in their cash flow," says Ms Yeahová.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former editor of the News of the World (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used the method "hack into the phone, monitoring and confrontation" to confirm the fraudulent tip on the romance, which should be involved, the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew EDIS at the Old Bailey court said that the newspaper News of the World, picked up in May 2005, the false reports that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlbyovou.</seg>
<seg id="4">Newspapers have attributed the private investigator Glenn Mulcairea to hacked into the voicemail Pawlbyové and penetrated her privacy, but the court said that Coulson called her and left her voicemail message.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecutor suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is not a man who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people out, but the man who likes to people the connotation of stories to see what they have to say," said Mr EDIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that the newspaper NotW used three ways of exploring stories: Nabourávání into the phone, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Editor is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
<seg id="8">Evidentně knows about the other, monitoring, must know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">And what about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">He knows about nabourávání on the phone?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says no, we say: "Oh, he knows."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fámy of romance in which Clarke is involved, were first captured the NotW story in the newspaper, when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs Pawlbyovou, was told: "You're wasting your time, it is with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">The record with vocal messages that were taken from her phone on at least three occasions, was obtained in Mulcairově house in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs Pawlbyová and her sister were referred to as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During a time when Mrs Pawlbyová investigated, her grandparents received an anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about Pawlbyové, said Mr EDIS.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup saw to monitor the movement of Mrs Pawlbyové.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coulson 18 June 2005, she left a voice message, in which he told her: "I've got a story that we are going to go tomorrow and I'd like to talk with Charles power."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr EDIS says Coulsona involvement in the story was the same model as for other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David BLUNKETT.</seg>
<seg id="19">In court on Thursday, said that Mr Coulson confronted Blunketta because of a romance with a married woman while he himself had seen the spoluobžalovanou Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks have denied conspiracy with others to hack into the phones in the period from 3 October 2000 until 9 August 2006.</seg>

<seg id="3">Fayova innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, on that point, the founder of the institution's solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than 60 houses in small clubs and large theaters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these titles appeared at Carolines and became a successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">This festival, we have created as a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances Wanda Sykesové, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (stand up for heroes), the annual musical comedy performance, in Madison Square Garden, which among other musicians Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as the spread of this festival, extended the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as the show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll climbed to his sitkomem (lightly spicy "League" on fantasticko-football topic on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central Station.</seg>

<seg id="12">As Kroll and Slateová, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (surreálně pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, scathing, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Concerns about the safety of Mozambique are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities</seg>
<seg id="2">Under the statue of Samory Machely, Mosambického president of the founder, is at the center of Maputo, thousands of people gathered for a rare public demonstration chanting peace slogans.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want to back the peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Out of fear for the future of their country's corporate dress in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "we want safe" in Portuguese and joined Thursday to the crowd at Independence Square in the capital city.</seg>
<seg id="5">After two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement in front of more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once notorious rebel movements, originally supported by white rule in Rhodesia and then the Government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise the independent of the government of this country.</seg>
<seg id="7">The peace agreement in 1992, has become an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe that it is unlikely to re-open conflict broke out in the country, but recent events got frightened foreign investors and local.</seg>
<seg id="9">At stake is a rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of large offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years may bring from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Italy's Eni and Anadarko American, investments worth more than 50 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling party Frelimo outside the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo party claims that the government has raised the last conflict by 17 September has launched an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.</seg>
<seg id="12">Violent assaults on the former rebels subsequently peaked when government forces attacked the base of the Renamo and tried to kill AFONSA Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times the Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames for the launch of the Renamo conflicts, because he had attacked the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to ease the fears of instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza for the French news agency AFP on Wednesday said that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever is left of his forces to try to prove that the government can make their own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Frelimo outside that Renamo claims that they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have risen when the word was quoted by Mr Mazangy that Renamo party withdraws from the 1992 peace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="18">Listu FT said that he meant that the party Frelimo outside the agreement does not respect.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with the seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done to alleviate the tension between the parties, fomented by a series of skirmishes in this year, few.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a skirmish between the two big personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the Lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not one of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo party, which has sought to electoral changes, has already expressed that boycotted the municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators interpreted the use of force as a dying movement's efforts to obtain the benefits from the government and financial proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="26">The election of the Renamo is decreasing since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo, expected to improve its position in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - he wants to destroy democracy in this country.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He doesn't want multi-party democratic system, does not want a transparent elections, does not want peace, because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what Renamo party has options, but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles away from the capital city of Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, a port, which rely on mining companies, including companies, Rio Tinto and Vale, with its exports of coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, the company Rio has suspended the use of the railways for about a week, when party Renamo threatened to attack on this line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo repeated his threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne entirely by the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find solutions to the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Nobody cares neither Renamo, Frelimo outside again, people just want peace, they want to have free access to the road," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of seats at stake are large contracts</seg>
<seg id="2">Among the leading aircraft manufacturers has emerged in the width of seats in the second grade in the long-distance flights, which this month the bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="3">The issue is the width of seats on long-haul flights for Economy Class - not just the one that usually preceded the airlines, but whose allotted space is the key to the demands of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main American rival Boeing says airlines are to decide on it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of its two long-range aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's how it is the rear part of the plane disintegrated - especially if it is around 9 or 10 seats - is the basis of economic performance of the proposals for new aircraft "mini-jumbo."</seg>
<seg id="7">The company Boeing says that the improved model of "777X" delivers 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread across 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company, Airbus says the A350 will carry a competing version of its model of 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out at 9.</seg>
<seg id="9">The giant aircraft are often attack each other in the technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that the 777X will gain the upper hand, with more than 100 orders, calls directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, provisionally showed what could be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers showed a picture depicting three people crowded together in a restaurant with the headline "leave you like it?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in the seats closer than they are in the regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is changing eating návky, people are bigger, but the seats on planes are radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-distance air transport to the turn of the century, according to data from the US Department of Health, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century over 100 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says that his rival is the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats newly pokřtěného aircraft were lower.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company, Airbus says it has carried out research that suggests that the extension of the seat of 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing Airbus rejects the dimensions of the seats and says that it is not within the competence of the aircraft manufacturers to decide on how airlines compensate for fees and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I really want to give the airlines flexibility and enable them to do things that are convinced that they must do to be successful," said an expert in the area of Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want to dictate to them what brings them a profit.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is vital for passengers more room for his elbows, but for the supplier is a growing problem that can affect yields.</seg>
<seg id="24">To this dispute is a race in aircraft orders, with an estimated trade in the next few decades, with a value of at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As stated in July, the agency Reuters, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claims that are in its recent proposals of the twin-engine long-haul aircraft efficiency by 20 percent better than the market leader in this segment, a model of the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.</seg>
<seg id="27">The performance claims Boeing depends partly on the design of the 777X model, compared with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.</seg>
<seg id="28">Profit in the unit cost is compared to 10sedadlovému concept weakened.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason that Boeing does is home to more seats, and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, head for the convenience of passengers on the Airbus for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many of the passengers is for denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Forty-five inches wide-seat passenger would be great, but the reality is that from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model," said an expert on the interior of the cabin, Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the portal Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing are not supplying seats, but the airlines offer a catalogue of suppliers to choose.</seg>
<seg id="33">Scestovalí sellers of aircraft even carries measuring the zone to check the competitive arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="34">While the comfort, all manufacturers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus is offering the A350 model, with 10 seats in a row, but says it still hasn't sold.</seg>
<seg id="36">Donedávna Airbus stressed the need for greater regulation of the cabin that offered for some of its aircraft wider seats in the aisles.</seg>
<seg id="37">Experts say that without the support of the manufacturer's only other major modern aircraft call for new industry standards they will remain, but may deter them from the waves of the sale of the 777X.</seg>

<seg id="1">Companies, Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group, which owns thousands of defunct Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a patent infringement action against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, a company that přelicitovala at auction in the bankruptcy of the company Nortel.</seg>
<seg id="3">Konzorcium Rockstar, which has purchased Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, zažalovalo at the US District Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company Rockstar is in the common ownership of companies Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of breach of the seven patents.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another ghost story of independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, warning that a condition for an independent Scotland's membership in the EU would be its entry into the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="4">It gave the cause for stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire fence along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - that did not translate into the headlines of newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one mentioned that the EU Member States spends a lot of time to adapt their official laws when it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given that Scotland is now in the Schengen, offer continued non-compliance would be for Brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the Scots really want.</seg>
<seg id="8">So it is quite weak story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it was so old that it has become a relic. The canard that "independence means passport control," I heard from at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in this bearded story is an interesting idea.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why would he ever have expected that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why replace London's yoke for the Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a real European story: A post-war plan to unite Europe finally failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across Europe, the influence of the party dedicated to opposition to the EU or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany-based this year - came out of nowhere and in September's federal elections had taken nearly five million votes, making the Bundestag essentially "wipe out" the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).</seg>
<seg id="17">At home has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current economic crisis, however, has become a decisive moment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Úspornost dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjackets navléknutou on the national economy through adherence to the common currency have led many to believe that the project has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, it is a system of the euro, which is blocking its members to exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and that German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, the southern Europe in the area of domestic production, compared to Germany disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only help is to cut revenues and public spending - which encourages Germany.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under the current problems with the budget and currency is the deeper cause of Europe's languid performance.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not all the freezing salaries in the world would not reverse zadupání European petrochemical industry a slate of cheap oil from the US.</seg>
<seg id="28">The result is a simmering rebellion, particularly in France, once the enthusiastic supporters of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will rein in Germany and will allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">Berlin and Paris have as a badge of political legitimacy does not need to enforce its own economic policy in Europe and the battered French economy to fend for itself.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: The right-wing Marine Le Pen, an anti-European National Front, just won a major additional options and will postpone the ruling Socialists in third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The queue is now the most popular party, with 24% of the votes in France - an early warning for the UK Labour that they cannot conclude that splitting the Right is automatically a positive effect on the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">As Le Pen disposes of their newfound popularity among the white working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">The European elections next year would like to use to across the European Parliament has created anti-European bloc acting against the common currency.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the anti-Europe party will lead in these elections, which is likely, can a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament to dominate.</seg>
<seg id="36">In doing so, I think in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency together and will destroy the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not disappear, but rather, transformed into something freer within the meaning of "Europe (sovereign) nations" already favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that the United Kingdom will distance themselves from this project and come back to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left atlantickému cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">And where will be Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be areas (in principle) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend its own economic interests - it is also an opportunity to Berlin and Brussels, where they have to let us go.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suppose that Scotland would have done well in the loose arrangement of Europe, provided that it has retained its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should take a cue from Norway and to maintain their economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The government of the SNP in Scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition's stance against the cuts, which had planned (and) implement Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents intersex children can choose "vague sex."</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Novorozené children will no longer be ranked only the male or female sex.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law from parents does not require for such children have any sex, and allows them to their native sheets to sex as "vague" or "unspecified."</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents to look at their child hastily opted for surgery in order to determine the sex, and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexuální.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersexuální person, according to the BBC, after many years, she said: "I am not a man or a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I'll stay slátaninou created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is estimated that each year from 2000 babies are born, one that is neither a boy or a girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersexuální, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Could be Intersexuální Wallis Simpson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States, says that if he could not determine the sex, it is better to use the best available information and to identify them, instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problems with the identification of sex, said that the new German law "looks like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersexuální children are the ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children, it is not so," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Identifying the gender can be carried out without the operation and then we can wait as the identity of evolving.</seg>
<seg id="16">The knowledge of how to develop the child's gender, is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one can answer the question of why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is like a mystery why some people are homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="19">The report sent by the European Committee in 2011 intersexuální described the person as different from transgenderových or transgender people, because their status is not linked to sex, but in their biological structure that is not exclusively neither male nor female, but typically consists of two and it cannot be clearly defined as either one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features may occur in the secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hairline, breasts and a figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexuální and transgender people in the area, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="22">The boys inadequate any sex now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australia and Nepal have already allow adults described in official documents, male, female, or "third sex."</seg>
<seg id="24">Norrie May-Welby, 52letá Australian, in June became the first globally recognised "sexless" person, when she won a court appeal to the rest of his life to retain the status of a "vague" sex.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Ministry of the Interior will have German passports, in addition to the M (male), F (female) as well as a third marking X for intersexuální person.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, according to news reports on the France 24 issue of sex is still controversial.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers in this heavily Catholic countries signed a petition calling for it to be removed from school textbooks "theories about sex."</seg>
<seg id="28">The American invasion and online, the Web site of the German law as well as define and wrote: "With the way the world is being dragged to a new situation where sex is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, převracíme inside out two other pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One mother of an infant from Maryland also said for the Baby zone that he would prefer to see that children have allocated sex at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting itself is stressful, even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said on the website on parental care.</seg>
<seg id="31">The children need stability and security.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, the children with both male and female sex called hermafrodité, according to the handsome River, which had a double gender.</seg>
<seg id="33">And about ten years ago, the medical community believed that sex is something like a table that can delete and redrawing again.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many are questioning the ethical basis of operations with the fact that gender is a complex issue and doctors sometimes may decide incorrectly, because they don't know how, because of their gender, children will feel when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency room," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these children born, you call a psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The persistent theories about how to deal with children with ambiguous gender, was presented to Dr. John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins, who took the view that sex is pliable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He created a new concept of "sex" and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment - as the parents of their children - were raised on children's genes and hormones, and formed a child, regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one case of 1966, known as the "John / Joan" his theory has become a contentious.</seg>
<seg id="40">The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly made, recommended that their child had been left completely fixed, removing his testicles and raised him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was 15 years old, leaving the přeoperovat back to the boy and married to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 38 years, however, committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that some doctors "are using this model" today.</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations were "dissatisfied with the result."</seg>
<seg id="46">This was the case and Jim Bruce, on the writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but the ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors weren't certain whether it has a large clitoris, or a small penis, and they were convinced that a man could never live "satisfactory life."</seg>
<seg id="48">And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce surgically removed the bodies and testicles, and was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the 12 years the female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I am not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask for it.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was sent to the plastic sheath.</seg>
<seg id="53">But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, asked for medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found was frightening.</seg>
<seg id="55">After birth, I was sterilised and no one ever said anything to me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with impaired gender development (DSD), which prevents the body to produce sufficient amounts of testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After he learned the truth, turned back to the man, taking the dose of testosterone and had to remove the breasts,</seg>
<seg id="58">The operation caused his infertility.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, the others in the organization called Interface Project and are trying to normalise the perception of those who are intersexuální.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (supporters of an informed choice), based in California, is concerned that the German law "calls for branding and stigmas."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are concerned that a German law that will encourage parents to make quick decisions and select the" vague "for a child," she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">Bojíme that encourage for intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We believe that it is better to allocate the male or female gender and then wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we don't know how the law will eventually lead, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattisová said that her organization supports the Australian law, because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex."</seg>
<seg id="66">"An adult should be able to make their own decisions about a legally valid sex," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">The German law is going to assign him at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is a battle that at this moment of small child should not blame.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, they can on their own body to make their own decisions.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratzová, radioložka chest from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "gives the powers" of both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratzové's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD called androgen numbness on the syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Since her androgen receptors are defective, developed by Katie feminine features.</seg>
<seg id="73">He has a vagina, but does not have a uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Katie 29letá is now married and in the studies at the University of Pennsylvania, working as an intern at the child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although it is fruitless, hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement of motherhood.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some room to take their time with his decision," said Baratzová.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them time to perform certain tests and change his mind and gives them time to write "man" and "woman."</seg>
<seg id="78">In this regard, it is all right - his child educate and love it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Uhlířský Hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Waterfalls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Along with several other shows the volcanic activity in nízkém Jeseník at the time (geologically recent).</seg>
<seg id="4">The last eruption, there were still at the beginning of the Quaternary period.</seg>
<seg id="5">When viewed from a distance, it is at the top of the hill Uhlířského striking a white stucco Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Mercy, built between 1755-1765.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nahradil the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inn, who was standing next to the church, had survived.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the completion of the church were introduced on a row of four ranks better, about 1 km long.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cross the road to Uhlířském Hill is already the third version of the original stood here in 1916, the second, lasted only from 2001 to 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">At fifteen zastaveních are wooden sculptures, which had made the local artistic carver, František Nedomlel.</seg>
<seg id="11">He used the different species from the Nízký Jeseník.</seg>
<seg id="12">Similarly, the base of the rocks from the area is an interesting geological exposici.</seg>
<seg id="13">At each stop is mentioned the name of the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="14">Uhlířský Hill is the rest of the young volcano.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if the data from a slightly different radiometric measurements of old age, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years of age and older than Venušina volcano (0.8 million years of age).</seg>
<seg id="17">The volcano was born the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it ejected a large quantity of volcanic ash and rock fragments from the bedrock, which acquired by firing a reddish-brown colour.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of this phase of lava flowed on the surface - today, it is the porous basalt layer to 13 meters powerful.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second eruption disgorged red, russet and points to black leucitic lava.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their layer is powerful to 50 meters, and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.</seg>
<seg id="22">In large tufech are conspicuous volcanic bombs of up to 1 meter, and the second eruption was completed by the outburst of lava.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the conclusion of the activity of the volcano lava flows, which now account for up to 50 m powerful layer struskovitého basalt.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sopky, which alternates gutting volcanic ash and lava outlets are the most common type of volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because they are actually composed of layers, were given the name stratovulkány.</seg>
<seg id="26">The original volcanic cone was subject to a gradual erosion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ohrožen was, however, when the mining rocks in the quarry on the southern side.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nejintenzivnější mining here ran from 1953 to 1962.</seg>
<seg id="29">Tufy ploughed into the concrete, which was then lighter and had better heat-insulating properties.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mining has been under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problem is, however, the cohesion in the porosity and small rocks, which quickly zvětrávají, crumbling and shedding downslope.</seg>
<seg id="32">LOM so relatively quickly disappear.</seg>
<seg id="33">To make matters more complicated, it's warm, south-facing slope of the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over the verdict delivered the crafter of the bomb attack in Bali</seg>
<seg id="2">Přeživší and relatives of the 202 people killed in a bomb attack in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily to the judgment given over the last plotter in who were brought to justice, and said that Umar Patek had been executed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for having set up an explosive device that was used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">For 15 years, he could be paroled.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many of the wounded.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty on several counts of related to terrorism, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecution demanded a life sentence, although it could insist that the man with the nickname "Demolition Man" (bourač) because of its reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives was given the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="8">This decision have revived painful memories of June Corteenové, the mother of Perth, which, when a devastating attack run Patekem and other osnovateli nearly ten years ago lost their twins 39letá Jane and Jenny.</seg>
<seg id="9">With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the agency AAP Ms Corteenová said: "It should be built in front of a firing squad."</seg>
<seg id="12">Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and their daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sari Club was razed to the ground when she was 12 October 2002, shortly after the 23rd hour fired a powerful bomb placed in a van parked outside.</seg>
<seg id="14">Paddy Peter Hughes was in the bar, where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was being kept alive, three doctors "died."</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cells responsible for the massacre - Amroziho, Muchlase and imáma Samudru - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">This guy should get the death penalty as a nobody.</seg>
<seg id="18">Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, just isn't.</seg>
<seg id="19">Getting 20 years for 202 people killed and hundreds of others injured, it is not all that much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek stood before the court as the last of the Bali bombers.</seg>
<seg id="21">He avoided arrest for nearly ten years, but in the end, he was captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, American forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent had testified that the intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish a link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Nevzdal voluntarily," said Mrs Corteenová.</seg>
<seg id="24">Up to now, he felt sorry for the grief caused the other.</seg>
<seg id="25">Verdikt comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and to which will include the ceremony in Bali and in Australia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis called in February, the first cardinals</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis on February 22, for the first time, called the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church clergy immediately after the pope, and there are those who elect the Pope, Francis will appoint its first group of men who will help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it is 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">But when Cardinal reaches the age of 80 years, who is unable to participate in the election of the Pope - a group that is shrinking at 120 voting cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement notifying this report, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that before the promotion of the new cardinals will be held on the current cardinals known as konzistorium.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene the February konzistorium beforehand to facilitate the planning of other Assembly, which requires the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero from the sheet of Voices said that the number of voting cardinals in February, is likely to fall.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the pope usually called so many cardinals, how much they need to increase the number of electoral votes again to 120, and many cardinals above the age of 80 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Konzistorium next year will be significant, because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment, there is a focus on Europe, Europe and above all Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis has been established by the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which was given the task of finding ways to reform the Church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, the pope ruled it for myself.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now, Francis chose the eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that it was "quite possible" that the cardinals Pope asks for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this situation, but we weren't before - it is a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that popes traditionally have ennobled the position of the bishops and cardinals from large places, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who's name."</seg>

<seg id="5">The Israelis clearly demonstrate how to look the bombing of Syria.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without undue hype, threats and millions of the statement sent aircraft, you hit the target and returned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without they had become lulled by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="8">They refuse to confirm the action and to ensure they do not represent.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact opposite confused and grandiose, the actions of unsupported Obama's Syrian policy.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the most satisfying throughout the attack was what the Israelis bombed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Don't be fooled by the media of their assertions that was bombed, "Syrian base" or "supplies for hizbaláh."</seg>
<seg id="12">Recently I wrote here about the fact that while the US aid secular rebels in the country remains on a rhetorical level, so Russia happily continue supplying weapons to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latákija became the target of the Israeli raid.</seg>
<seg id="14">A clear message.</seg>
<seg id="15">And note, Israel again bombed Assad's regime, not the rebels, although it according to the popular Internet theory should be the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="16">The American government, two members of the spaciálních units, probably the Delta Force.</seg>
<seg id="17">Netušilo so far that distinguish themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is known a heroic death of two former the SEALs, who defended the CIA in the city, I think they were members of a secret CIA commandos, which is made up of former soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a long time, there was speculation that the SEALs were working at the consulate or even in the CIA's mansion located elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now, it is clearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (just over one of the two members of the SEALs were killed by a mortar), is quite surprising.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even more surprising is the information on the two previously unknown heroes.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report on the attack in Benghazi voluntarily came forward to intervene and, together with five private kontraktory shot their way into the compound of the CIA in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obama Administration Itself the fact that during the attack wasn't the same squad deployed officially and the whole and that simply hesitant about what to do.</seg>
<seg id="25">The leader of the squad, so without orders to release these volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, the fact that the country is not a one-off, but permanent American commandos, CIA agents and privacy kontraktoři is quite an interesting information.</seg>
<seg id="27">And given that until recently was officially admitted anything like it, and even now, the only talks about a consultancy NATO's mission in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is good that the US even though half-heartedly tries to combat terrorism in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although the resolution of the national situation if it wanted to help a lot bigger.</seg>
<seg id="30">The last part of the secret and enduring conflict, I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not so long ago, the media dress near the Iranian air force for the prosecution of American drones.</seg>
<seg id="32">Few, however, it is unknown how Americans their drones effectively protects.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course, if he can find a drone in the airspace, you can't do anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, if it is discovered the Iranians drone in the area of the world, the situation is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so it was that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was haunted by an American drone in international airspace over the sea, which was perhaps the first American super-sharp deployment of the F-22 Raptor in history.</seg>
<seg id="36">The pulling Phantoma to visually verify its weapons without Phantom registered on the radar, or simply saw it and then when he suddenly appeared at him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he did so without complaint.</seg>
<seg id="37">No wonder when the Phantom is an American production, which, however, remembers the war in Vietnam.</seg>

<seg id="3">The second US Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal, which was lodged by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Judge decided in August that the city violated the Constitution so that has implemented its programme of stopping and questioning people.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the postponement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Court of Appeal said that a judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, and the fact that the judge had not acted in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements, which openly responded to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics as part of its programme, stopping and frisking people.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ustanovila independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reforms in the procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme in order to test their cameras on the body in some areas where there are the most common stopping people.</seg>

<seg id="11">Oral arguments, the appeal of the city is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tactic of stopping and frisking people have criticised the ranks of the defenders of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some form, there is a stopping and frisking people for about a decade, but recorded an independent inspection under the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases for blacks and Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2004, the framers of the four men, who all belong among minorities, an action that has become a case of collective action.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of the changes of stopping and frisking people conducted by the police department in New York says that the changes will put an end to unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures used by other police departments.</seg>
<seg id="16">Oponenti argues that the changes will reduce police morale, but not a crime, and that the money will be wasted, but will not solve the larger problem, which is under pressure from the police force after his numbers have declined over the last decade by several thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted that the practice of not stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but it has reformed the way searches in the New York Police Department has introduced.</seg>

<seg id="14">And what about that if it was true what they say (he is) no one could have to register with the same name, or the same date of birth, if this is already registered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just by the way I did in those 13.22 registered on the same name and date of birth, but I used fictitious e-mail and phone number and the wonder of wonders, I discovered that my page on the e-mail was sent a link to complete the registration.</seg>
<seg id="16">But how can this be possible when they cannot be registered on the same name and date of birth?</seg>
<seg id="17">Probably because the Tipsport binds registration on e-mail and phone number, and the date has not surrendered just as tough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I told this technical support once again that simply lie (either intentionally or they don't know what they write), because what they write is not true.</seg>
<seg id="19">I doložil several screens that the problem with the registration was 31 before making "false" registration on this simply does not influence.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Tipsport wrote me the stark sentence - I'm sorry, but the fact that you have already registered again, we cannot verify your claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">And the communication.</seg>
<seg id="22">Respektive repeats the same phrase over and over again that the registration binds to the name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nedokážou nor accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail, and there was no one, either.</seg>
<seg id="24">If that is the bottom line, not only the Tipsport that does not dispel the data as claimed, but he is lying when he says the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="25">What's worse is that it can be easy to prove how they lie and trying to make it appear that the fault is on the side of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog things to move a little bit and came from the Technical Support e-mail that the matter be transmitted to review and I will be informed (after a week of urgencí and argument and warnings on the same mistake).</seg>

<seg id="1">Fantastic ice cream, which glows in the dark?</seg>
<seg id="2">The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream, which glows in the dark - using the jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal and developed a luminous smile.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea came when he read a scientific treatise on medúze, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produced protein that causes the phosphorescence.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - increases the pH levels of the protein, and subsequently causes the radiation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more lick, the more September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, the founder of an ice cream company "lick me I'm delicious" (olízni me taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so you'll get £200 for about 2 g of this substance."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein, which we use in the ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So how your mouth heat protein, increasing the pH levels and the ice cream is beginning to glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">Testovali it over the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of Halloween, because this is a fantastic, brilliant effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">And so I every hillock costs about £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it tastes good.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol, is known for its non-traditional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and leaves of gold.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next product to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says: "I really wish to make an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">In essence, this is impossible because of the effects of light caused by ice crystals, which make up the ice cream, but I suppose that, a way to do it, we can find.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ice cream is using fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.</seg>

<seg id="1">Instead of the post-election sirloin post-election stew</seg>
<seg id="2">The October elections rather than the winner has brought a bunch of losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's not just the parties that are not even in the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government party (ODS), TOP 09) and eventually ČSSD because of their internal division.</seg>
<seg id="4">Politicians are instead of festive sirloin has served up on the weekend of the post-election stew.</seg>
<seg id="5">Springer elections became the movement of Andrei Babiše, which promised voters to change the political style of governance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Roztříštěnost election result and a schism in the winning side plays into the hands of the political (of) the willingness of Mr President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who side that President Zeman publicly supported or get elected to the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="7">The president was due to the unpleasant events lost the strategic policy ahead of the others, but there are still a few ways to get it back - for example, by selecting the future prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the Social Democrats, the chances of obtaining the prime minister in my eyes away, entrepreneurs Andreju Babišovi the opposite approach.</seg>
<seg id="9">While povolební development is still miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government, but compared with the pre-election scenario of left-wing governments ČSSD supported by the Communists, is this development for business in the Czech Republic and hence the economy had better news.</seg>
<seg id="10">Given the loud opposition YES to get together with the ODS and TOP 09, is still the most likely scenario coalition of the Social Democrats, ANO and the KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 MPs).</seg>
<seg id="11">Given the schism in the Social Democrats, which has thus become unreadable and weak parterem in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be pretty depressing for ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="12">The government minoritní ČSSD composed with "nezemanovců" at the Castle probably get away with it.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, any government that the Social Democrats will participate, will be threatened by unmet ambition of many of the Socialist Group, which may lead sooner or later to another schism in the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, I ask myself: "Nespějeme gravity to other early elections?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Another option would have been more of a referendum on the strength of electoral mandate of the YES.</seg>
<seg id="16">These plans for the implementation of sectoral taxes, raising taxes on income or building a state-owned bank, fell hopefully under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Social Democrats, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn, in turn, agree, for example, to promote entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, the lower rates of VAT on selected goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friction surfaces are most prevalent in view of social policy and the size of the state.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yes, but now has the upper hand, so the program so far, the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning more to the right.</seg>
<seg id="20">Which, in my view, it is ultimately a better outcome than the left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving.</seg>

<seg id="4">In fact, it didn't matter to them and to the state of the (theft and indebtedness of the state), they were really happy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters have stayed away from the elections, 596 357 voters voted for the TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legitimate voters.</seg>

<seg id="8">This, in fact, a majority of voters have made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty rozkradení and over-indebtedness of this state.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists more throw light on how the movements of the tail is linked to the mood of the dog</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research has shown that the radiant dog wags more transport (from the point of view of a dog), while the nervous dogs waving tail largely left.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences in the movement of the tail to record and respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a from the University of Trento said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different link to the incentives that create a positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">That's what we're trying to see in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that, as is the case with the people, even in dogs is the right side of the brain responsible for levoruké movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an effort to obtain more information about how the dogs respond to asymmetric wiggling tail of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Měřili heart rate of these animals and analyze their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes, on the one hand, and sometimes on the other.</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "We promítli dogs films about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing incentives, and we could also adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals could see otherwise lackluster dog's tail move right (from the perspective of a dog's tail vrtějícího), remained quite calm.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when the tail has largely left (again from the point of view of a dog's tail vrtějícího), their heart rate has increased and the animals were uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Vallortigara said he does not believe that the dogs through these movements knowingly communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rather, he believes that the dogs have learned from experience that movements have and which does not need to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you several times with the dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to a more friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that the findings are the owners of dogs, vets and cvičitelům to help better understand the emotions of their animals.</seg>
<seg id="17">The expert on the behavior of dogs, John Bradshaw, a university teacher of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs away his head to the left, when watching an aggressive dog, and right, when looking at the jolly dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another professional paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: "With the dog robot dogs are more likely to show when wagging his tail to the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite, compared to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">The difference may be given to him by dogs in these various studies of animals in movies or dog robots were talking quite like dogs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Vysvětlil that might help the study of how dogs respond to the real dogs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">But given how easy it is to record their behaviour, probably won't be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to two people familiar with the situation suspended the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), two traders in their division with a foreign currency, which is another indication that the global investigation of the supervisory authorities concerning the shady things with the currency market is becoming increasingly common.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that cooperate with the competent authorities on investigations of the largest financial market in the world, where every day is changing owners of 5.3 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zmínění two traders would be the first RBS staff suspended as part of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the scandal involving the manipulation of LIBOR (the London inter-bank interest rate).</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that this month has received a request for information from the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our continuing search continues in this matter and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, the people who are close to the event, said that RBS had forwarded the British Financial Conduct Authority records of e-mails and instant messages sent from the accounts and the accounts of the former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">The businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position of the European head of foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, the chairman of the trade for cash at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former manager for trade with currencies in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neither of these traders has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group of Mr Usher for sending instant messages were bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said the people to this event.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bank UBS, this week said that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that had been investigating shady on the market with a foreign currency in several Swiss banks, has taken action against some of its employees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Worldwide, at least six offices - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Authority Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - is examining allegations that these bankers would conspire to move the currency market.</seg>
<seg id="14">People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation, or from the competent authorities received a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="15">The banks are combing the years old with quick messages and e-mails to find cases of some offences.</seg>
<seg id="16">Reports of investigations startled traders in the area, which was one of the biggest engines for profit in the accounts of investment banks in recent years, but that was disrupted by a small currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, said that with a large and highly liquid market with a foreign currency is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it may not necessarily be true.</seg>
<seg id="18">The senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading in foreign currency dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing use of their own internal platforms means that "you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The report came on the same day that the company Credit Suisse announced that this week's release of his department for trading in shares of the trader, who at the end of last year, has caused a loss of almost $6 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank immediately alerted the authorities and cooperate with their control authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved," said Company Credit Suisse.</seg>

<seg id="10">"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he says firmly.</seg>
<seg id="11">There may be, it is alleged to the New York Rangers, who had been a failure to enter into the season, and they have wounded two mainstays - attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.</seg>
<seg id="12">How's your arrival in the Rangers look like?</seg>
<seg id="13">They are just speculation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until I have something on paper, so it's not worth considering.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know that the article in The New York Post that he would have to sign me, but that's all.</seg>
<seg id="16">There had been delivered that it really happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but that's just the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nor did you from the club?</seg>
<seg id="19">Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is about to get into a situation where the contract really coming.</seg>
<seg id="21">When will be hurt a player or that someone is not a team ever.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get the contract.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in New York, a similar circumstances arise, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24">The injured man is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team failed to enter the season, so there is a chance, don't you think?</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, there is always the chance.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the second thing is that you always need two sides.</seg>
<seg id="27">I took a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is, unfortunately, the reality in which I have to live.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Friday, you are flying to America, you are in the expectation that something might work after all?</seg>

<seg id="45">As the family and children, that is the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="46">Whether you have a job, what you want.</seg>
<seg id="47">I had a job that she was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me, in addition to the family.</seg>
<seg id="48">You had a lot of offers from Europe: You have that you want to play the NHL because it is the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?</seg>
<seg id="49">Since I'm a hockey player, in the first place - in addition to the family - including sporting success.</seg>
<seg id="50">NHL is the best competition in the world.</seg>

<seg id="55">We should offer them a chance.</seg>
<seg id="56">If you're planning to stay in America permanently?</seg>
<seg id="57">We're going to practice as now.</seg>
<seg id="58">This means that we will be in the summer in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and in the vicinity of Ceske Budejovice.</seg>
<seg id="59">And in the winter in Tampa, or wherever they take us our steps.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is absolutely ideal, still be warm.</seg>

<seg id="64">To a woman, we can choose where we live.</seg>
<seg id="65">There are a lot of people who are hungry for this, so that they can choose what they do and how they live.</seg>
<seg id="66">As long as you have in your age will work hard, work hard and wait for an offer?</seg>
<seg id="67">Yeah, it is a question that I can't answer that.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, I still have it in him, the juice, the passion, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport Tu desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL that I was still better than anyone else.</seg>

<seg id="36">The brain stores in their billions of connections and electrochemical connections to all the memories, experiences and the experiences that the man had lived.</seg>
<seg id="37">Logically, this forest and emotionally exposed to and branching trees information registers of memory, the brain uses in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to the constantly changing presence, in a constant efforts to try to identify and understand the importance of their surroundings and decode messages.</seg>

<seg id="60">And even then, after years of contact randomly on the street and thank me for my book helped them in some of their heavy life decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schools should focus more on the math, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">In the hours of English literature will need to examine at least one of Shakespeare's plays, the novel of the 19th-century romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test will also include a "hidden text" to motivate a deeper reading;</seg>
<seg id="4">The combined courses in English literature and language will be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, from students will be required to have a graduation exam of the language, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and math - the first items to undergo a radical change.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the other major objects are waiting for changes next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a separate step, Ofqual Authority, which oversees the graduation test detects changes in the structure of the graduation test, together with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his speech in the summer of Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said that there is "broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal to regain the confidence of the company" and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test was "more demanding, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">The study shows that the English schools spend less time mathematics - 116 hours a year, or three hours a week - than most other countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">For comparison schools in Australia are paying mathematics 143 hours per year on average, and in Singapore about 138.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although there will be no official request to devote more time mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that the comprehensive graduation test of mathematics - along with greater emphasis on this subject in the result rankings - is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I'm not rakovinou in ČSSD</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the election, is fully ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings of fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="3">All in when the Mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned to court because of the undemocratic compilation of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Actors cases still didn't want to comment too much to the party before the election even more damaging.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, however, the votes are numbered.</seg>
<seg id="6">The management of the Ostrava ČSSD so right on Monday evening, called on the mayor of the city of Ostrava to come out of the party and will probably push to lose its function.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.</seg>
<seg id="8">What is in disputes and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview to the Daily News.</seg>
<seg id="9">How do you see the outcome of the election?</seg>
<seg id="10">ČSSD be counted with a much better result.</seg>
<seg id="11">Poškodilo it with us to address the media before the election disputes within the party?</seg>
<seg id="12">I imagine that the social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on the other hand, it is the state in which one it is now.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a party that has its own internal problems, it is inherently sick and people don't see that it's not all right.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have made it clear in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="16">What are the internal disease ČSSD?</seg>
<seg id="17">The decline for some time, according to the ODS through me and things like that, unfortunately, is now taking place in social democracy.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected its prebendy find in the ODS, moved to the people in ČSSD and have influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="19">It then has to do with the fact that the offices of the city's airport police and collects computers.</seg>
<seg id="20">It shows that the Social Democrats is not composed only of people who would like to the benefit of all the others, but many of them are thinking above all to the good.</seg>
<seg id="21">ČSSD is divided into two opposing camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.</seg>
<seg id="22">That, too, but prepared for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="23">What happened before the elections in Ostrava, was only a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="24">Haškovo wing gradually obsazovalo positions, then after the election, it could cause a situation that will weaken Sobotkovo wing.</seg>
<seg id="25">A man is in politics in a situation where sometimes has to compromise.</seg>
<seg id="26">But everyone has an internal border, when you don't make compromises, and this is also my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Originally, I didn't want to run in the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, so I agreed with Lubošem Zaorálkem would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen as Mayor of Ostrava Sobotkovo right wing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Haškovo wing but it could stop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why are you standing on the side of the Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michael Haška?</seg>
<seg id="30">Slávek Sobotka, to me, is a man who always speaks mainly on the Social Democrats and, to some extent, the visions for the party and for the country.</seg>
<seg id="31">I confess that from the other side, I haven't heard anything like that.</seg>
<seg id="32">Michael village just fighting for power.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don't understand how can the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the Executive Committee, to just dismiss the chairman of the party.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the articles of association.</seg>
<seg id="35">I think what now Michal Hašek demonstrated in Prague, ended his political career.</seg>
<seg id="36">How did you feel that you did the Ostrava leadership ČSSD on the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="37">Political parties are based on competition, who are both in their members be placed.</seg>
<seg id="38">The competition should be largely based on programming visions and the ability of those people to fill the vision.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, in this competition, and the people who do not have a lot of ability and vision, but the political party is for them a lift to the money that would have gotten elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="40">The problem is that these people begin to get to the fore because unscrupulously violating the rules violate the constitution of the party.</seg>
<seg id="41">Its practices are from the political parties, the Mafia and I think they are violating the laws of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Alert me on this issue is more important to me than to take into account whether some Kajnar has a political future.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important that the parties began to respect the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="44">That is why you are handed a proposal before the election to the court for interim measures against a nominee ČSSD v Moravskoslezském kraji?</seg>
<seg id="45">The current district Executive Committee ČSSD in Ostrava, consolidating his power by organizations that do not meet him, he can cancel, of the new organization is based, gradually firing uncomfortable members of the party.</seg>
<seg id="46">An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednaříka from representatives of the club, but he has filed a lawsuit against it and then they resolution on his exclusion rather canceled.</seg>
<seg id="47">This shows that to enforce compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but when the other ways and supervisory bodies inside the ČSSD stopped working, it is the only option.</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the Ostrava ČSSD led by a member of the Adam Rykalou's appeal to you from the position of the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post Poruby Lumír Palyza.</seg>
<seg id="50">So, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza is trying to do everything possible to ensure that they could appeal to me.</seg>
<seg id="51">Slibují people positions, gaining votes, and then those voices are consolidating their power in the party.</seg>
<seg id="52">When I go back to the past, so everything that happened to be around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the stadium Bazala, was just a pretext for them to strike at me.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was artificially staged, that I could be described as a man who gives money where it doesn't belong.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the same time, the city bought the property, which is of great strategic value for him.</seg>
<seg id="55">So how do you see on to his remaining as mayor of?</seg>
<seg id="56">The District Committee for me and other people on Monday urged to consider their continuance in ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="57">But I think it's as if a thief crying: "Stop thief!</seg>
<seg id="58">When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, so I don't see anyone in the Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and pushed through, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, such as industrial zones, or the expansion of science and technology park.</seg>
<seg id="59">Still, everything I become inconvenient.</seg>
<seg id="60">I don't read it differently than to interrupt the others, to the point where they want.</seg>
<seg id="61">You will still have to fight against these efforts?</seg>
<seg id="62">Because if the Republic of this work well, they must work well and political parties.</seg>
<seg id="63">It's hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state, if he can't drive or itself.</seg>
<seg id="64">Neuvažuji, therefore, that I have now left the Social Democrats, because I think that whoever causes cancer this side, not me, but those people who are trying to remove me.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Royal Commission heard that before the claims against Jonathan Lords were accused of two employees of the young men's Christian Association (YMCA)</seg>
<seg id="2">The Royal Commission on the sexual abuse of children learned that before charges against child educators Jonathan Caringbah lord of the city in 2011, two employees of the young men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were in charge of sexual abuse of children.</seg>
<seg id="3">But before the commission said that, in his opening statement to the committee, the association said that in his organization never tackled the case of sexual abuse of a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case when he was one of the employees of the YMCA associations accused of offences relating to child pornography, and on the other, when the Physical Education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah from the association in 1991, he was convicted of sexual harassment of children who were in their care.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Hare said Gaili Furnessové, adviser to the commission that he knew about the case, but not the second.</seg>
<seg id="6">He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was also inaccurate, as stated in the organisation of the YMCA to carry out external audits, which praised the organization as a leading supporter of the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">The evidence submitted by the Commission says that the YMCA had been alerted to the fact that in the audit of the Ministry of Education and the company in August this year, the second lowest of the four possible ratings.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Hare, which began with the YMCA associations to work when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him down failed when Mr. Lord has taken without assurances that the staff is aware of the obligation to notify the breach of the rules of the safety of the children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys who had committed during the two years when he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for at least six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Hare, however, rejected the assertion that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff to report security breaches of children, Mr Lord.</seg>
<seg id="12">Members of staff provide evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, privately on them, letting them sit on his lap, he used to tell them that he likes, and he is playing with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwellová, who was a child of Mrs. Lord and asked for the training of the safety of children, because she was worried about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui BARNAT, head of services for children in the YMCA Caringbah in the city, which was Lordovým superiors, was "very intimidating, and often it was difficult to talk to him about something."</seg>
<seg id="14">Director-General said that does not accept the evidence of staff that he felt uneasy if they had contacted their superiors and deeds to report.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, and therefore not report the problem.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the board of the YMCA associations in New South Wales state its view that the lessons of "the case of Jonathan Lord" for the organisation lies in the fact that the staff "did not file any report," and the Council agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations emerged, made a general manager for services to children in the organisation of the YMCA Whitleym Liam showed.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said that the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence, but it was "over-zealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">An expert on sexual abuse of children by Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffithovy University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not between 2009 and 2011, the organisations that would be safe for children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - in addition to calls from their mobile phones - for reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated new rules on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers do not expect the changes occur immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to the individual airlines, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airlines will have to manage the FAA to demonstrate the extent to which their aircraft are in line with the new rules, and that the updated training manual for cabin crew and guidelines for storing equipment to comply with the new rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic equipment, very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, passengers are required to switch off their smart phones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the door closed aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="10">They cannot be turned on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers, and the captain, issued the permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">From passengers are expected to shut down their plants again when the plane is descending for landing, and nezapnou them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new rules, the airlines whose planes are properly protected against electronic interference, to allow its passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since most of the new transport planes and other aircraft, which was modified so that passengers can use the stars at a higher altitude, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Gladingová, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new rules will be introduced safely - and we don't, we will work closely with shipping companies - will be a success," she said in her statement Gladingová.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're tired of, frankly, that we look like "guards."</seg>
<seg id="17">However, surfing the Internet and sending e-mails and SMS or downloading will remain below the 3-kilometer altitude forbidden, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be notified to their smart phones, tablets and other devices they switched to the air.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words with friends, the online game of Scrabble, played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from an aircraft company of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of fears that it could hurt someone if flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Calls from mobile phones will be on board will continue to be banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rules for the use of mobile phones does not determine the FAA, but the American Federal Committee for telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="23">The FAA may in some electronic devices during takeoff and landing to lift the ban.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mark Rosenker last month from the National Committee for safety in transport, an expert on national security in the transport sector at CBS News, said that mobile phones will continue to consider the risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because it could potentially create interference with the navigational instruments, but data from the FCC, we also know that in the air can cause interference transmitting towers," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Oborový advisory committee created by the FAA to examine this problem, last month suggested that the government allowed the wider use of electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Kritici, such as Senator Claire McCaskillová, a Democrat from Missouri, says that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
<seg id="29">Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to put forward, because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies suggest that up to a third of the passengers forgets the obligation to turn off their devices or ignore it.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the cancellation of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry the FM radio, technical achievement of the age.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airlines are far more dependent on the aircraft's electrical systems than previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">The airlines have for several years, offered to passengers using Wi-Fi in travel altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="34">The plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of the airlines would be under the new rules had to adjust for the increased use of electronic equipment, Huertová said.</seg>
<seg id="36">The current electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio broadcasting than it was at the facilities of previous generations.</seg>
<seg id="37">For example, the electronic reader issued in turning the page only minimal broadcasts.</seg>
<seg id="38">But the broadcast is stronger when they withdrew the device or send data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those who are pushing to relax restrictions on the use of these devices passengers, it is.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, the company's deputy transport plane loaded with its Kindle electronic readers and carried out a test flight, but no problem appeared.</seg>
<seg id="41">The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said he is convinced that the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other members of the committee, said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to promote the fact that such devices can cause interference air systems, and most of these reports is very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended that the FAA allowed pilots to order passengers to shut down the device during the instrument flying at low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, and it is a sensible approach to the travelling public, which uses the technology in profusion.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in breach of security," said Roger Dow, the executive director of the American Association of travel.</seg>

<seg id="2">John Kerry suggested the US refining defensive posture on their monitoring programs and, in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases, espionage "went too far."</seg>
<seg id="3">The foreign minister also admitted that, together with Barack Obama is responsible for that, with regard to the incendiary revelations about the NSA spying activities that appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowdenovi, acted as a "autopilot."</seg>
<seg id="4">The published information triggered a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Kerry, via video-link to open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have really learned about some of the things that the inertia of guns, because there was a possibility, with reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, the 11th of September."</seg>
<seg id="6">He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government, who admitted that the American espionage crossing the border, but stressed that it did not violate anyone's rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the president is determined to try to explain to the people and to clarify and already carried out a thorough review to ensure that no one had the feeling that there has been an abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the world, there is a radical extremism, which is firmly determined to murder and fire people up and to challenge the government.</seg>

<seg id="15">The President Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that US policy makers are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad, which relate to alleged American espionage, and convince the Europeans that we must continue to combine their forces in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other persons, and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in the anti-terrorist organizations because they are frustrated by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).</seg>
<seg id="17">For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remains with us in the same boat, with regard to the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said in an interview from Washington, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and President of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on European affairs.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm heading to Europe, has made it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of telephone records in Europe, disrupting relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency, said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and shared with the United States,</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents revealed over Snowdenem that the NSA has monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders to 34.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper espionage allies defended as necessary and said that it is from both sides of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the tumult, Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary path that should take place this year, and hopes that will appear in the delegation members of both parties and chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the next few days to be published the names of the other legislators who intend to engage.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the program is still working.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip is to help repair relations, adding that they will be ready, "well-intentioned education measures."</seg>
<seg id="26">He said that European leaders must be honest to their own people, in terms of the spy programs that use themselves for years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we adjust their monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones spying here," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is going according to plan this weekend in the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the hostility, has already resulted in the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the American surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="6">The package of 325 million dollars contains 31 million dollars for the operation at the request of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract operations will help eliminate debt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Money is also freely accessible to the clinic in Hobart and Launcestonu, better postoperative care, training health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="5">Thanks to his knowledge of the environment should contribute to the reduction of tensions between people from poor places and people from the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="6">In its proposal to reduce the security risks counting, the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, it would help to improve the situation in the country, mainly "accelerated provision of social housing."</seg>
<seg id="8">The document has discussed the government.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the analysis was in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago, around 300 towns, homes and neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="10">Žilo in them to 80,000 people, mainly Roma.</seg>
<seg id="11">Adults in ghettos were without a job, the families were dependent on handouts, children ends in a "special" schools.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bujela usury.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the experts, the problem of sites, meanwhile, about a hundred.</seg>
<seg id="14">Relations between the people and the others are sharpening.</seg>

<seg id="20">The specialist would go to run errands in the ghetto, where they would spend up to half of their services, the rest would serve in his district.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the troubled location would oversee the order.</seg>

<seg id="25">The introduction of special police officers in the problem areas will have to pay from the Norwegian funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about $15.5 million crowns).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Czech Republic holds 15 percent of the amount, 85 percent of the funds.</seg>
<seg id="28">Preparations began this year, is now working on a detailed proposal.</seg>
<seg id="29">The project is to last until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="30">The authors are inspired by the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="31">This mechanism is successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where there is a problem with the socially excluded locations far higher than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There are so-called Roma settlements," said the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="33">How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.</seg>
<seg id="34">The answer is to give an analysis to determine where the special police officer would be needed.</seg>
<seg id="35">Záležet will also be on how much money to these members of the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the proposal, the project first selected police officers receive training in Slovakia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ivan grew up and spent most of his life in the apartment house with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful vilových neighborhoods on in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="3">The original owners of the house, but it gained in restitution and tenants had to move with little severance pay.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ivan so quickly to find alternative housing for himself and his elderly mother by then.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the known got a tip on a flat 3 + kk in older panelovém domě on the opposite side of the Prague.</seg>
<seg id="6">"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of a large dam and a forest park thrills me on the other side," says Ivan on first impression.</seg>
<seg id="7">At first I thought it would be a stopgap for three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today we live here more than 13 years, and not just because of the gradual reconstruction would not change it," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mother and daughter had migrated from stodvacetimetrového apartment into a smaller flat 62 m2 and almost all the equipment to dish out.</seg>
<seg id="10">The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arranging lasted almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new apartment was in pretty good shape, but to pass the necessary adjustments, such as painting doors or exchange of windows.</seg>
<seg id="12">Předešlý blasted away at the core of the owner, but the owner of the most inconvenient and unnecessary or in a large hall and a small bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">By combining two rooms, a multifunctional living space.</seg>
<seg id="14">The architects used for the demarcation of the zones and the layout of the room drywall, which has enabled the new location of lights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first intervention, which, after a few years she was the rungs in the living room.</seg>
<seg id="16">This apartment had changed the layout of the 2 + kk, but the room has received the airiness and opened with a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.</seg>
<seg id="17">The next step was to improve the standard of PVC floors for the Formica.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the bathroom, Ivan didn't know.</seg>
<seg id="19">For years, I drew the magazines on housing and looking for inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="20">In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting implementation.</seg>
<seg id="21">So I called on the recommendation of the young architektku Kamilu Douděrovou.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was really the most important step in the future," says Ivan.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thanks to the rebuilding of the bathroom managed at the same time to adjust and the availability of the hall.</seg>
<seg id="24">Architektka joined the space toilet and bathroom and two doors with otvíravými wings replaced one sliding, thus save the place.</seg>
<seg id="25">The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently accessible.</seg>
<seg id="26">Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower is an extra seat in the toilet bidetová shower.</seg>
<seg id="27">The successful cooperation with Kamilou Douděrovou continued.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the context of the show How to build a dream was quick, but the fundamental change in the living room, which was also the architect Martin Čeněk.</seg>
<seg id="29">The area, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping without helping the traditional principles of optical division, for example, or Japanese polopříčkami walls.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This would result in a breach of openness and uniformity of the space," explains the architect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Originally managed to separate sleeping and living part.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was enough to turn his back two sofas and between them to build a custom-made box on the blanket.</seg>
<seg id="33">The breakfast nook define the shades of floors and painting.</seg>
<seg id="34">On the floor in the kitchen and the dining nook of using an architect quality marmoleum, sliding doors has revived the wallpaper pattern.</seg>
<seg id="35">Kuchyňský kout, if necessary, conceal sliding panels with the wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="36">The new floor of antialergického marmolea has many advantages over the previous of fibreglass: The softer nekluzký surface seamless and better sound insulation.</seg>
<seg id="37">The niches and ceilings of the plasterboard highlighted color is an example of how we can work with the space in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="38">Colors I left on architektech, I wished it to be joyful.</seg>
<seg id="39">"I like orange, the same shade I had in the previous quarters," says Ivan.</seg>
<seg id="40">Themed obklad from grafoskla blooming magnolias is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.</seg>
<seg id="41">To warm their energetic tone architects chose the white, which underscored the modern functional style.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a small apartment managed to save the books, among other things, in the space below the window sills.</seg>
<seg id="43">Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="44">In contrast to the new předělaném interior works well with older, for example, with the decades-old crystal chandelier, with high-quality art objects that Ivan collects all his life.</seg>
<seg id="45">The last came in a series of the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cabinets were previously deployed on both sides and the owner had seemed a bit like here in the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="47">Architektka lighten up their numbers and přeskládala deployment.</seg>
<seg id="48">The furniture in a simple design is made to order, but slightly pearly white surface.</seg>
<seg id="49">In a small space fit nápaditému thanks to the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.</seg>
<seg id="50">The appearance of a small kitchen revived celoskleněný lining the walls above the plate.</seg>
<seg id="51">Unique grafosklo with digitally printed motive is attractive, moreover, is well maintained.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ivan chose magnolií flowers that remind her favorite neighborhood, where she lived for years.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now it seems that he is happy here.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the original bathroom was a small tub and sink into the new owner has opted for a neutral shade mural.</seg>
<seg id="55">A large shower stall has a glass door Ronal.</seg>
<seg id="56">The task was to create a simple space from the environment in which the functions and equipment will be in harmony.</seg>
<seg id="57">The interior of our bodies and color to unite and try for his elegant, comfortable, not too crowded appearance.</seg>
<seg id="58">"Another condition was a barrier-free solution with the minimum of obstacles and opportunities for easy movement around the furniture and the availability of everyday objects," adds Kamila Douděrová.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jana Péťová: A step back.</seg>
<seg id="2">So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it is not really a step, but a big jump - jump a few years back, and into the memories of my childhood.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is the memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash dishes, vacuum and do his homework.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although these "obligations," it was mostly just a theory, the parents' wishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The practice was completely different - run from school, drop the bag in the corner and run out.</seg>
<seg id="6">Playing with other children, ball games, some video games.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then in the series, Helen and her boys to embroider řetízkovým stitch a festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.</seg>
<seg id="8">And then finally, after subsequent warnings to wash the dishes, vacuum, fetching wood in the winter in earthenware stoves and tasks to do after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love poetry to the high school sweethearts).</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning, go to breakfast homemade strawberry jam (real fruit, not one of those jams that are sold now, the content of which was beside the strawberries), a tea of dried herbs, which we were so pleased with my mom.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, I remember those enchanted evenings, when there was dead silence in the room when we played the sister of songs from the radio on the tapes, which were loudly in the old ghetto blaster set for my mom.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then we went to the pencil přetáčely tapes and let himself over and over one of the same song, our favorite and a připíjely trap.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or we have across the desk phone early for using cans, which were tied together with string - and while we're on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean ears, then uchošťour was the match + wadding.</seg>
<seg id="13">The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in it so that nothing was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have no nepotřebovaly those iPhones, iPady or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Clothing has been handed down from generation to generation, and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a tie-dyed T-shirt domestic production for using the SAVA.</seg>
<seg id="16">From the electronics took us to the satisfaction of the mother's Walkman tape player and the maximum so that we have shared with his sister, who, by the way, we were just on a train on a school tour.</seg>
<seg id="17">We thought it was more interesting to play with Aunt kloboučku Hop or backgammon or, as I have said, "just" go out.</seg>
<seg id="18">When I was a little older than we got under the tree videopřehrávač, surely his parents were saving for a long time, but unfortunately we long for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="19">My younger sister in the narwhal strudel, supposedly so beautifully Papal tapes, so she tried if spapá and strudel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, spapal, but it was his last bite.</seg>
<seg id="21">Well, and this incident is still poor, still on a plate from my dad.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that when she was little, narwhal pie in the video and thought that it plays a recipe and played, so it still doesn't know how to bake.</seg>
<seg id="23">I remember how we can all communicate, communicate with a cell phone, computer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Together with my sister, we were on vacation with your grandmother who agreed with the granddaughter neighbor, when we meet again next year in the summer with the grandmothers - and so it was, so it was true.</seg>
<seg id="25">We sešly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Promise now with someone that you will see in a year?!</seg>
<seg id="27">I remember the winter, too, when we were running out with the whole village, built snowmen, rode on the snowy hill near the church on bags filled with straw.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then we dined together with the family and talked about the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, we were told before each dinner with my sister's notorious phrase: "Go wash your hands!"</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, it is true today, but definitely not in the bathroom to tap přivázáné soap in the net from lemons.</seg>
<seg id="31">After dinner, when my dad was working in the garage, "" in the beer with Jardou from the village, we were on the floor with his mom, his feet propped on the tiled oven, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of wood that came from the stove.</seg>
<seg id="32">We were closer - really - we counted how many of our friends on the social network, we knew how much we have friends, the real!</seg>
<seg id="33">We komunikovali together - we talked - we wrote daily messages across the various hut, smsky.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was nothing of the sort, and yet we know a lot more about themselves.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so I could go on for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's nice to remember, especially if these memories fill up by looking at the albums, where they are neatly put up black horns caused by black-and-white photos.</seg>
<seg id="37">And if I didn't know how old I was, from behind the photos is always written in the year of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="38">I look that, although we didn't really suit haircuts, according to the pot, and we should trousers after poking two sizes larger, no one will laugh at us before, it was so normal (not IN).</seg>
<seg id="39">And I prefer to go back to that step forward - into reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">By 2013, and I will wait to see what the modern period up to be one of my children.</seg>
<seg id="41">What I do know is that these are my memories are now for a young teenage generation, so at least somewhere, "a century for the monkeys," and I think a lot is that this "předopičí" while also own lifetime.</seg>

<seg id="3">Báňský magnate, who leads a dispute over payment of the tax base of coal with a value of $6 million, the statement said, when he jettisoned the question of whether there is a conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Palmer's United Party can handle up to four votes in the Senate, which play a vital role in deciding whether to levy a tax on coal and mining activities.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr. Palmer said that the conflict of interest may be only ministers, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have a personal benefit from the policy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The approaching the effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the law on commercial corporations from 1 January 2014, intensively preparing six out of ten firms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only eight percent of the companies surveyed reported that matters related to the two key codes in their company tackled at all.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is clear from the survey firms doing Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">In relation to the effectiveness of the two key codes now at the last minute, many managers are beginning to realize they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The biggest change in private law over the past 50 years, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because of the manoeuvre politicians lived long business sector in uncertainty, if it comes to the revolutionary changes in the end or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Now, there are only a few weeks to make the transition to a new law passed for their businesses without complications," commented on the results of a Deloitte partner doing Legal Jan Spáčil.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of the 61 percent of companies engaged in intensive new codes, 26 percent said that their companies would take all the necessary measures to be ready in time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, 35 percent of companies from this number is going to take the necessary measures in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="11">Against this, every fifth firm has not yet rekodifikacemi, yet has a clear idea of how to prepare for them.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 11 percent had no opinion and will be able to assess the issue.</seg>

<seg id="14">The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of respondents by signing new contracts (21 percent), followed by addressing the terms of trade (16 percent) and further changes in the real estate registry and liability (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">For contracts will be one of the most important news of the entire rekodifikace and unification of the adjustments to the Treaties only within the framework of a new civil code.</seg>
<seg id="16">The current parallel adjustment in the Civil and Commercial Code goes, with the result that the contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.</seg>

<seg id="2">One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over an American consular office in Frankfurt, capital of the German economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, was the purpose of the mission to take photographs of the roof of the American outposts, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German media claims that the BFV had hoped to be able to identify the presence of spy antennas, and launched the action in Berlin exchange of views between the American and German Foreign Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, in September, again insisted that the United States used its foreign intelligence capabilities, "stealing trade secrets to foreign companies in favour of American companies and enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, who is from the co-worker became an informer, he began to reveal their valuable collection from the secret monitoring of the United States, European governments and business leaders that they do not know if they have the words of the director of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="7">After reports that the US National Security Agency to conduct espionage in the Brazilian oil company and gain access to data, with whom they have American cloudoví providers, including Google and Yahoo, have reached the general paranoia about the monitoring of new dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged ten years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If it can be subjected to the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly a potential target and business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden zprůhlednil intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a survey issued in July consultancy service EY German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and theft of data, the US now represents as much risk as China.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents revealed Mr Snowdenem, however, so far there is no evidence that the United States transmit the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain skills in the field of IT and the Internet, and said that should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical to it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of the German Parliament, there are voices that we should make the German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just, I can close my eyes and slowly open them again.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not the way to go, says that Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.</seg>
<seg id="20">If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, not to let him 20 years ago to die.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything in Germany shall rise from coal to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything in addition to the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">The scope and the technical maturity of American spy agencies detected Snowdenem is for some companies who have believed that the biggest threat from the monitoring is China, still shocking.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a big turnaround in cloudové computing, where European leaders on a wider scale realised that the data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction and are therefore potentially irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey by the business community of cloud security alliance around 10 percent of the non-members after the discovery of the US Prism programme to cancel plans to use data mining cloudového provider based in the US.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs SAP, says: "We have a new question for customers who have been here a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction will remain physically?"</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: That powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is the economic espionage, it is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is always happening.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is a major issue for many years, and it has changed significantly, even during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General agrochemical company BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Podnikoví manager is generally very unwilling to boast protiopatřeními, which made it to the attacker did not provide any advantage.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of large companies have long been recalls that take in the free memory USB disk or leave them unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of automakers Audi, says that for many years, it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the board of directors of mobile phones, so they could not be used as a listening device.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German office of the BFV directors advised to consider whether or not to use on foreign trips, simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk of smart phones can be embezzled.</seg>
<seg id="36">Prepaid mobile phones are then fired.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets to neautorizovanému approach," warns BFV in his report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US has its own company warns against economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the Washington post documents of the US National Intelligence Estimate stated in February by France, Russia and Israel in the second row of the criminals who engage in hacking activities for the economic newsletter, just behind China.</seg>
<seg id="42">A member of the Council of the German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>

<seg id="1">The new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse for life in front of nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before tests on humans is the need to carry out further tests, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York, says that the first signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches to overcome," said Professor Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the creation of antinikotinových antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to create a continuous stream of these antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies are pursuing all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, which prevent a smoker's nicotine intervention.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests of vaccinated mice, which was subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the mice that were not vaccinated, "settled down," said the researchers, which is a sign that the nicotine they got into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because it contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The injections would be administered so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, which have proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because the liver cells are converted to a factory for the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Crystal said that if a future vaccine for humans will be completely safe, they could bring their children before they have the taste of a cigarette to try and prevent that nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it would be much more likely to use smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine will have no benefit from it, and that will help them get rid of the bad habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said that the results were interesting, but pointed out that there is a need for further research.</seg>

<seg id="2">I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope for a possible change</seg>
<seg id="3">He said that Obama's sincere efforts to derail the Republican obstruction</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstrukční policy cannot justify the woes of websites of Obama's health care or attacks by unmanned aircraft</seg>
<seg id="5">Memoáry Obama's campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have happened</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris, the second year studying medicine at Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="7">In those days, I read a very sad book.</seg>
<seg id="8">About this book, I thought me during the grim days of my second year at the medical school will encourage and restore a modicum of hope in me.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win" (troufalost to victory) and it is the memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I finish the evening reports of patients and I'm going to bed, book me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches you were breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="11">The elections ended in overwhelming and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates wept with joy and my parents were saving newspapers that they got.</seg>
<seg id="13">The White House headed a team of young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the inauguration in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">And here the book closing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Go to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is hard to remember these optimistic days - seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years after I threw his first electoral ticket, there has been a change.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was certainly nothing of what I imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the affordable care over the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and an end to the policy of "not to ask questions, to say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that the partisan obstruction reverse so many efforts to move our nation forward: Immigration reform, among other things, the ability of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after many situations where I am in front of colleagues and friends defended the Obama administration, I am in terms of explanations that can provide, came to the absolute limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">I ocitl in the place of political desperation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obstruction for Republican Spain cannot explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders, even with raids of drones that kill innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">They cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or that haunts those who discover improper behaviour of the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakího, an American citizen, without a proper court for the reduction of public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="27">Cannot be justified by the findings of the report, which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... from the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, nor can apologise to the inability to create more than three years after the signing of the affordable care simple Web pages.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know whether something like this.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I was in 18 years, suggested that the government's power may be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volená function apparently does not have a predictable course and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party, and the random events, such as the massacre in Newton.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, all of the examples that I mentioned above, to a large extent, appear to be the result of his own administration's decision.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that worries me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney was confused and nevybroušenou alternative and seemed unable to consolidate its policy or position.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with the hope that we once heard.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, it is a return to 2008 - with the support for Obama this week dropped below 45% - through this book increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me remember that a number of promises that were lost.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama during the primaries in Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="40">For additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he must get back into the groove and remain faithful to their mission.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want to get back our magic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must not forget that who we are.</seg>
<seg id="43">Five years ago, Mr. President, and I agree with you entirely.</seg>
<seg id="44">The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="6">Completion of this, in principle, the initial phase of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to be destroyed by mid-2014 all chemical weapons to Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="7">The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">Damascus, however, has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is expected that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came at a time when the fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts described as the headquarters of the factory for the production of chemical weapons and storage sites, said the Syrian observation room for Human Rights, based in Britain.</seg>

<seg id="13">On the government side has to go on 29 954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those killed was also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that since March 2011, 100,000 people have died in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then, the number has not been updated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced about 2 million people to leave the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's forces fought in Safiře against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pozorovatelna on Thursday said that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underlined the dangers faced by inspectors for chemical weapons, who are in their mission, when they are in the middle of the ongoing civil war in Syria to get rid of the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a statement from the office of the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the United Nations, was told that his team is now a "satisfied that the check - and watched the destruction - Syria's declared major equipment for the production and mixing / filling."</seg>
<seg id="22">He added that "there are currently no further control activities."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they have completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">The inspectors said that because of safety concerns were unable to visit two places.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, the office of the OPCW said that these two places in Syria has been "abandoned and... the items of chemical weapons, which included, have been moved to two other declared places that have been inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safiře was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria agreed on a plan to complete the destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.</seg>

<seg id="4">This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">Contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller says that direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the whole project will start its operation in 2015, the Bulgarian consumers receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a reduced rate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company Gazprom says that it has in other countries in the direction of flow to begin by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Developed earlier</seg>
<seg id="2">Research has shown that Afroameričanky and Hispánky reaching puberty earlier than their Caucasian contours.</seg>
<seg id="3">The physical changes do not mean that approaching puberty</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence that they are hormones or other chemicals</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts say that one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend earlier puberty is not so evident for boys.</seg>
<seg id="7">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should the mother zděsit, when her daughter will grow breasts and pubic hair in the groin at 7 or 8 years?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of paediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida explained the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spent a lot of time by my parents said that it is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full of puberty," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Visible signs of development, such as the growth of the chest hair at the groin and armpits and body odor, the girls appear earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last forty years, however, was only a small shift in the age of the first period.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12,75 years in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When they start to develop breasts typically takes at least two to three years before the first period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to tackle this growing problem.)</seg>
<seg id="15">Nejspolehlivějším test of how puberty will continue, it is time.</seg>
<seg id="16">Diskutuje is about what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if the growth of breast accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 years of age, the girl is considered a "mature" prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process slows down or stops - which may paediatric doctors closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="18">Faster growth may be a reason for it to carry out tests endocrinologist in order to avoid the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: Premature ageing bones, which can ultimately lead to stop the growth and zakrslosti in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatments are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Are also important psychosociologické aspects.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regarding the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty can mitigate the problems with the behaviour of the girl and her feelings that are different from their peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">Pochopitelný is another big problem: Parents simply do not want to see their very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They do worry that it may become pregnant, or how it will handle the hygiene," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," says one woman, whose daughter began to have menstrual period in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't prepared emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and angry that it is the first of his friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are a lot of well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, there is still a coherent set of evidence that they are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">The boys - like the girls - are reaching puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2001, he helped to carry out the study on the girls, ranging in age from 6 to 9 years old, which connects the body fat with the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country have Afroameričanky and Hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">Explanations are different.</seg>
<seg id="36">From a global perspective, it seems that the patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions over the climate to the genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another puzzle: Although the boys are already at a young age appears on the face and in the groin, the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of paediatricians (AAP) added to this issue further complexity.</seg>
<seg id="39">Acne and pubic hair pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We have to be careful in terms of how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from Goryebské Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to obtain from their pediatrician's instructions on how to talk to your child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean the need to talk with the child sooner than you expected," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">The girls who are moving earlier, they need reassurance that even though it is early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Winter sports fans have slit a meter in the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others on their preparation with increasing fear.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Russian Olympics, even if it starts up in February, is grappling with another scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Russians had apparently failed to fulfill a promise that the preparation and the organisation of the Games in the slightest impediment of nature in Krasnodarském region in the foothills of the Caucasus, where for four months, will head the thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones during the launching and landing, and regardless of changes in the US in order to mitigate the rules on these devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the American companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books on its facilities, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight, when the device will remain in the "air" regime.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people is that they cannot have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australští carriers are exploring this decision from the American carriers requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to in the near future to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that the announcement of the probe, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight in Australia are still in force.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Casa currently has no specific regulations covering the use of electronic devices on the plane," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">This issue is covered by the regulations, which require aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with security guidelines that will gain from the members of the crew.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company Virgin, which has already spoken with CASA to expand the use of its in-flight entertainment system, wi-fi, was inclined to change, but announced that it is subjected to a decision by the regulatory authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We uvítali if the CASA has analyzed the permission to use electronic devices, because I really think that now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment), improve the customer experience," the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company Qantas announced that for the time being, will hold the current regulations.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change in the short term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">FAA rules apply to American airlines.</seg>

<seg id="5">Others, however, there is some inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists on how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the movie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jiří Dušek (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Brno): I like science-fiction films, which I think is a modern, dreamlike fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="8">Film gravitace included, even though he faces as a "real" physical performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not, but that does not mean that it would be bad.</seg>
<seg id="10">I užil him very much.</seg>
<seg id="11">You can be hair všimnout Sandra Bullock, which somehow raises in microgravity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hubbův Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different orbits, and therefore cannot be seen in one shot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some viewers of the film about the unreal active effect and the behavior of fire in weightlessness.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also hold skafandry such wounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">The heroes in the film gravitace often come into conflict with various objects and suits without much trouble it holds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even the critique was not spared the plot.</seg>
<seg id="17">So extensive tragedy in Earth orbit, according to some people is unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair technique.</seg>
<seg id="19">People on the forums arguing about the "unrealistic" behaviour of the ropes.</seg>
<seg id="20">They say it operates as if it was intended for bungee jumping.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marcel Grün (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Prague): I saw him only on a broad canvas, but clearly I can say I was enraptured.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm glad that it wasn't a film documentary, but science- fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">And in such a story is the author of the law (almost) painstakingly consistently reality.</seg>
<seg id="24">"More than you mention irregularities, it struck me, as it is displayed three space station with the lowering of the level of technology (the Chinese) for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="25">"The Chinese will, after all, until the end of the decade, and probably will look better than it is in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="26">Vladimir Karas (Director Astronomického ústavu Akademie věd ČR): The computer-generated scenes, the authors are trying very successfully so that the laws of physics, and so the viewer-oriented přírodovědně will appreciate that the various space conflicts and clashes quite rightly maintains the momentum, said a dictionary physics, also a view of Earth from space is very realistic, including a thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering in the polar regions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Irregularities in the indices they'll find.</seg>
<seg id="28">Additionally, I am reading the commentaries, for example, found that the preferred direction of circulation of space debris in orbit in some scenes appear inverted than it should in fact be (from west to east).</seg>
<seg id="29">Jiří Štěpán (employee Astronomického ústavu Akademie věd ČR): Some things, the creators have adapted to their needs, but no major and blatant offense against the logic, or the laws of nature, I have not seen in the movie and in comparison with other films that focus is to see that the creators have depend on the credibility of the depicted events.</seg>
<seg id="30">From the moments that don't make sense it is worth to appoint the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result is considerably different mutual speed and rescue operation would therefore, in fact, could not take place as displayed in the film.</seg>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I noticed that the ISS was, therefore, there is no clear origin of the forces acting on the try, which makes both players to go at a time when they are already against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit fell as a result of the decline in shipments and orders</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and trains on Thursday reported a 15-percent drop in net profit, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems in the train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any data on air test for its new CSeries aircraft type, nor offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will adhere to an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After opening a test flight for about a month and a half, the aircraft flew only three times, and this raised the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results have fallen short of estimates and the shares on the stock market in Toronto fell by 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen declined on Thursday rating from "higher returns" to "the power sector," with the expectation that the stock market will experience over the next quarter or two limited growth.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the smaller aircraft deliveries are mostly expected profit margin in the field of transport us greatly disappointed," Doerksen said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the test program will continue, we believe that the Bombardier CSeries aircraft will receive new orders.</seg>
<seg id="9">If, however, will not be announced in the coming months, no new orders, we assume that the market will increase scepticism towards this programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company Bombardier hopes that the aircraft of type CSeries probojují into the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was discovered in March, after months of delay, the first flight was held in September.</seg>
<seg id="12">The number of mandatory CSeries aircraft orders, however, amounts to a modest 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claim on the low consumption and savings on the cost of transport aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="13">At present, a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.</seg>
