<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy, to confront the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws that hamper the process for the registration or the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills have been introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that the voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, also be shortened by these laws, the periods for the early vote, declared to be invalid, the right to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the course of the last two years, they encouraged to show bills in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced to a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card, such as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e., 21 million eligible voters have no identification document issued by a government authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are, however, often to pay more than a hundred dollars, to obtain the necessary identification. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 years did not have the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are considered more voters, who will be voting for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo identification issued by its establishment. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, it may choose the same states members of fishing or hunting clubs that more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state asked for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a request. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that demand from the voters that they prove their U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures aim to limit the vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is clear that two of the three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration for the general elections in 2004, to register some 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted in five other states laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 general elections were in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the whites, who constituted accounted for 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened in order to implement the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear objective is to influence the results in the key states for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with any certainty that these changes to the electoral system of legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test on the way, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to further delay the already indecisive men for the implementation of screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two doctors. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies carried out in the United States passed a number of spoilers between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without screening. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed that the probability of the formation of metastases to 30-40% is higher in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years ago, when there is no screening was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, if one has a direct relatives, who had already been ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men Afro-American origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, making the options will be presented to him, where Prostatakrebse can remain untreated, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men, where no one has detected cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active surveillance and offers progression of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for a decision as to who should be dealt with and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> However, it is most important to talk with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Society for Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevention of the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting him. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%,&quot; emphasises André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, Mastdarm, oesophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life protects against colon cancer,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommended to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> It is too large quantities increases the risk of developing a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But their investigations are currently not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu-sur-Mer stressed how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Analyzed the Higgs-only </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-bosons has caused a stir in the last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Indeed, it is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was our best of the standard model - or &quot;at least&quot; false declaration of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but not yet observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is really the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs-only. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week at a major conference in Kyoto, but there is a lack of data, to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Nevertheless, we are assuming that it is actually the Higgs, there seem to be only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is all about. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world there is a law, which means that two objects may not be present at the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to violate this rule - and they do not try to do too much, because you are hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law is also for you: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can&apos;t occupy the same space at the same time, if they are located in the same &quot;Quantenzustand,&quot; with this &quot;condition&quot; is from some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Based on the part of the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and obey the principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that you can, in fact, are located in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons, according to the website The Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay, which we will not deal with here, and the &quot;power&quot; through which the large forces of nature and spread with the Higgs-only would somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> But here it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are in the position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the photon or the &quot;light,&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle speeds up with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field exactly at this place, &quot;disturbed&quot; about like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon, and thus one of the bosons &quot;sources of power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs-only, with the difference that another field that Higgs field, must be &quot;disturbed&quot; so that this only shows up. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to reach very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is why we need a giant particle accelerator at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve this kind of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do not do this, but others - for example, a sheet of paper would never even in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all of the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For all this research can now be &quot;good,&quot; said Mrs Plamondon asks? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, there are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and fill some of the holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter has more major shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, at CERN such deviations were not found until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to say, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw further scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, the late physicist Boyle - which has worked in the Bell, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the self-developed in 1962 the first laser (the first were gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning, rather than a &quot;laboratory.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, has developed Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in a small room. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as &quot;eye&quot; and has earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know it... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With your Committee &quot;die in dignity,&quot; Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, there is still much to be done in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le devoir has tried to look at this closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, which had aufzehrte him, let him a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years,&quot; he said, half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he was reached the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, there is always a shock, you can&apos;t be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease makes their work: an immense weakness prevents him to go to the toilet, and even to eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned to help with dinner. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Even succeed him to smile and to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, around him bring his medicines, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating,&quot; he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in the stand,&quot; Pierre-Victor-Gadbois told Brodeur, a psychologist in the home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation returning home for some people. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the ability of the person,&quot; to take a step backwards, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> According to several people who work in the palliative care to find great events taking place in the midst of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All the patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> You have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses, who care about you, not with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, &quot;and&quot; by suffocated to death. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But I learned my children really know by the disease. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no more hope in life,&quot; she says, before she accepts that one up a mask, which helps her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> You can expect in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who comes from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The home Victor-Gadbois offers with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care will then be used, if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make it more enjoyable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, if you take into account that we all die someday. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Given the dying according to a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son will be drinking beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help families and patients alike,&quot; director Nathalie Savard reported. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man of 93 years, which enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years ago, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Six months since three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago,&quot; said Dr. Christiane Martel shares with concerned. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their dwelling, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say to a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health-care system Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to a quality palliative care, before it is accepted, move to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, no one has taken measures to alleviate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And, at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST treat their patients despite the worst predictions doggedly until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has canceled an arduous chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin that I will break off the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it must be said clearly that the palliative care is not in pain treatment Janet Quarton. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After Monereau, director of the palliative care of society of domestic palliative care of Montreal are talking about 8% of patients to a pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to the-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer do so, as if we do not take this side of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain will increasingly be able to fall back on these-terminal sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, &quot;I want that they put me,&quot; but &quot;I would like to say that my pain is relieved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the Road Administration, companies in the construction sector, creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day to tell what they know about a great &quot;system&quot; in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry,&quot; which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange, as the system is unraveling, since it has taken drastic measures,&quot; Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and a former head of the Montreal police witzelt. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties in Quebec, which had reluctantly agreed with the then Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report &quot;Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,&quot; he stressed, &quot;would have been the Transport Ministry alone saved $1 billion on the Treaties,&quot; because some zügelten your instinct to get their share. </seg>

<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has made house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third-largest city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Moreover, engineers have been accused of Straßenbauamts of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has attracted attention by the Commission explains the functioning of the &quot;system&quot; for the preservation of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He himself has paid for several years, 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator, associated with the Mafia gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr zambito has had in the 2000s throughout his hand in the game, he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of political parties, especially on the power of his liberal. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted to have organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former construction engineer Gilles surprising has described it in detail before the Commission: ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 in return for contracts, whose costs artificially pumping up. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they were artificially aufblähten the bills with false benefits by 30-40%. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party&apos;s mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay accused that he deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, which has filled its coffers with black money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations at the beginning of November, Mr Tremblay resigned, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, which suggested an alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As a citizen mistress of the budget of the city district of Rivière-des-prairies, in the east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of a community that, for $5 million was bought and sold for 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market. </seg>
<seg id="239"> More than 70% black money in the election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation, which is being carried out at the end of the day, she says that they &quot;on a thread, which allows you to understand the workings of the system of ants migrated to stop the evil and to condemn the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> She says that the procedure &quot;was painful, but in a positive way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are trying to clean up the wound, but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to clean power. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but above all thoughts about the role of the &quot;mandate, which are about the tactics in the picture,&quot; if they were not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> On the basis of a share of more than 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: &quot;I was told that this is only a weak imitation of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100, which would change nothing in the situation, according to him: &quot;as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of political parties: &quot;we cannot fall deeper; when we go to the bottom of things with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story damages the international reputation Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh, to take a look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season, you have adopted a new dimension with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can explain to him through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players are coming. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I make progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff gave me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game that is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything is very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t break out in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They are taking advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The latest games this summer are accustomed to a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player, like I, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in terms of my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I do. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> As a matter of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Jeff inspires respect for all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He looks back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are lurking in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified us in this way for the eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we are going to talk with against a very good European teams have our say. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to be the first of our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already been the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Weld together the resources so that this project takes concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really at the heart of this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season, we were informed. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to cope with the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally you should be with 79 points... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has had an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we can win in a home match against Troyes 4-0, and it is still a little place, what they accuse us, and that is certainly a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never win every weekend with 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to make a game concept. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds up with the times. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have proven strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> You look at Manchester City, a club of the past two seasons failed to qualify for the eighth finals, and which has made huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed you to break with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Geboostet, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season of this new PSG were not good. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in the month of May, smiling winner, and we say that we have finally won, despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, that one speaks of a &quot;Zlatan dependence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he is coming, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he has played, he has led in mind that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This stimulates the others to improve their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all the others, in order to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was to take part in my heart, at the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, something has to beat my injury prevented from playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things, from which I am emerged stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Since this was my baptism with the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behaviour on the day. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> It was, as well as Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to make any comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved his goal, he had qualified for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the &quot;Bleus&quot; after Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> On 16 October in Spain, forced draw (1: 1) a game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has campaigned for all the others. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin without paying and selling bank is possible </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system designed by banking monopolies, leading to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> This is indeed by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange, such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions have already been collected. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand websites Bitcoin accept as a donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 has reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to $2, before he has recovered today at around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She describes Bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro,&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that are used to make headway in a video game, which you can win games or buy (and sometimes back). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed such a system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Each time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, trustees of the Court of Auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the traded Bitcoins are taken into account in the book in the entire network of public accounts. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The decisive step is to contribute to this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege, add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> &quot;The computer,&quot; the new transaction and add a number before the whole thing is being hacked to bits. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the one number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this number has been found, and the other nodes can easily check, whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is closely linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user wants to pay to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes), with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network, and the other remains without a link, because both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre... </seg>
<seg id="380"> In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with each improvement of computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes,&quot; Pierre Noizat, which has just introduced Paymium, this is a company for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin assured. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering by using this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, cash has also these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They will be accepted by others, such as the blog platform WordPress. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the invoice book and shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, a &quot;mega-Schlussverkauf&quot; was launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold looks forward. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book on this currency firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, the owner manages its identity and thus can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can easily be implemented at the dealers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone &quot;and&quot; recognized, Pierre Noizat indicates, which assures that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems to be reconsidered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take some time until 2013 Bitcoin prevails, but could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB sees in her report to assess the various today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are withdrawn from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States are likely to follow at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is high time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without having to expect all of us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers, as we have seen them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves with our soldiers killed 88, as well as the injured and damaged. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban often consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Do you want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if you have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Sometimes tolerated, supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there, and if the Western countries to be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Financed by the base in Nijrab, which I have observed with almond trees planted hills, using the French loans was the withdrawal of French troops, was carried out properly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The tanks and helicopters überflogenen truck convoys have reached Kabul, without having to be attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, there will be no more of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Since its irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty at the time and the country as a result of the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The takeover was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to the security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the al-Qaeda organization divided farmers, but their situation has not yet improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahedin, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are coming back to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned themselves in business, they have seized plots of government, in order to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefit from the massive American awarding subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> As I have heard it in the campaigns, people do not want a government that is composed from thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who have been able to make use of the American donations: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people have had enough of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million, which is one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> These young people who do not want to go back to the obscurantism of the former parties nor to the corruption of some executives, one will have to make jobs available. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All parties, including the armed, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world is being watched everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> An army is now available. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle has already committed to the restoration of the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzaï wants no foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, it is his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries were not re-established, functional storage plants are not available and important irrigation system has not been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables will be produced nothing. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative will be the priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country that has been directed by 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, to seize. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy, to handle the iron or copper ore mining on the ground, or without any means of transport for an export over the mountains is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have left the copper mine mes Aynak already almost, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site, and the most important employers remain in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day, it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on exports and the produce to restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young colleges, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support for the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, a service &quot;civil-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carry out of a small French non-governmental organization, to try to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, for the number of local workers were required to contribute to suppress the uprising: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase of farmland. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Let the military spending of two billion back? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, which are very hard in these often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres valleys. </seg>
<seg id="449"> In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> So that the farmers get rid of the insurgency, which is led by foreign groups according to their own statements you wish to continue lower, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid would be required for their benefit. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new poker game of President Mohamed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, which granted him temporary unlimited power, more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a map. </seg>
<seg id="454"> To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the completion of its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Egypt is based on a number of occasions now for almost two years ago on a provisional, the amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has provided only for greater division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the president remains in his &quot;autocratic&quot; Delirium, &quot;when he breaks his word&quot; and &quot;the right underfoot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the sides of his supporters we are assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 14 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which the brothers forces to abandon their plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the president is once again to find it a manner, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest rages across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Given that the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote will be an ultimatum: &quot;either is true for my draft or do I keep the unlimited power,&quot; the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end. </seg>
<seg id="465"> 85 largely Islamist members of the constitutional assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request. </seg>
<seg id="467"> On the eve of the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have been turned away, because they are of the opinion that they are not in a position to express their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted alike. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, Deputy members, added. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim brothers. </seg>
<seg id="471"> It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day is... In the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clocks  the Constituent Assembly was not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which has been adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Finally, Article 2, which attracted all the attention is identical with that of the constitution of 1971, and states that &quot;the principles of sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that &quot;the principles of&quot; by &quot;to replace the&quot; rules, which would have made it possible to make a stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; the Liberals say that this can only be seen as a propaganda. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution via other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In doing so, they have particularly Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in terms of the examination of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is worrying, because the people who are not being asked for an opinion, &quot;have been elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the first signs of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university is likely to be much less moderate than the present. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;There is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no ulema, but academics, who have been trained partly in the French system, &quot;says Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased. </seg>
<seg id="486"> He admits, &quot;that can have an ambiguity in terms of the article, because the terms are used borrowed the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It is here, in particular refers to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will be severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers, which he was granted to the president of the republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brothers argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another point of contention: the powers of the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Likewise, there will be no ban on the use of civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> The latter also share their fears in relation to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Moreover, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines HEBA Morayef by Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> This word was not included in the previous constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> While the Egyptian president had to say yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The great and powerful leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While Members of Parliament and civil rights activist discuss the usefulness of the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers to come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each working immigrant must pass a test, the knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> So far this provision applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, the tests with the time, according to federal immigration authority should be in the future for all guest workers on duty. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We must not only language tests, but also take tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Language must be demonstrated both for the conservation, as well as the extension of the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian is an official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> It is also exempt from this law, people who receive their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> The problem, and the protection of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The whole of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, St. Petersburg of the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, the State University and other Russian universities. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The migrants can put the tests in all the cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 center opened. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration authority. </seg>
<seg id="602"> On the other hand, human rights activists said prior to the entry into force of the law in the press on a number of occasions the following question: what makes the whole thing? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes does the legislation to have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, spokesman of the migration authorities say, it is trying to reduce the number of forced labourers. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrants,&quot; says the head of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Their rights must be protected, however, already before departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> On the problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stuck with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We have many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In the home is the one you promised, and they are cheated on arrival, have taken their passports and do not receive the promised pay,&quot; the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rail, chief! </seg>
<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not control not only the language of the country, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much their debt, rather than the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Because, in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As a teenager then these children to take the first opportunity to make money. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;It is difficult without language,&quot; they admit. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You still feel humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Civil rights activist in terms of the law following an important aspect. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The test only migrants must discard with legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> You do not have that status, so there is no review and, therefore, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome&quot; or &quot;ban on access for unauthorized&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fabricated, and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,&quot; the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow manifests itself against journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Just spare no expense for false papers,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> Already on the day on which the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Some counterfeit certificates which certify the completing of the language tests have already been beschlaggenommen by employees of the federal immigration authority. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The fake papers were printed with a normal color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, that the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to spare the tests to be paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: it costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, are united both officers, as well as civil rights activist. </seg>
<seg id="637"> For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time by the test, only promise that you will have time for a language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, in areas will be newcomers without language, in which no active understanding is necessary with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> Share of legal weapons offences extremely low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Thus, the authorities to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow. </seg>

<seg id="644"> The proposal has been the chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes will be presented to the arms of the Duma shortly. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems through &quot;attraction of the screws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter was published in the Internet, whose authors call - representatives of various associations - from the authorities to take the &quot;senseless&quot; distance. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the experts in criminal law, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC said. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousands of crimes have been recorded for the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will hold criminals not to use on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> At the moment, you can find in Moscow, according to the authors any weapon for little money. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the spread of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: from the factories to the officers </seg>
<seg id="653"> The weapons come through multiple channels on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="654"> There are five main channels, a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff told. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot of a web page, which accepts orders </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were stolen from the Russian officers, as well as the Kaukasiern themselves,&quot; says Baranez. </seg>
<seg id="658"> On the second channel illegal weapons, parcel of criminals will be stolen. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranez explained that include weapons that were stolen, both from the arms of the police, as well as directly from employees of the law enforcement authorities. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Further illegally sold weapons from military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many military camps, it often came to explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There is evidence that there was, in some cases, arson, to cover up the absence of weapons,&quot; says the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to make a contribution to the black market arms manufacturers Baranez. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Nowadays there are squandering countless private arms factories, which do not withstand international competition and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, such as in Moscow,&quot; the expert reports. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Another channel of the black market is the smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, which organized the smuggling,&quot; explains the former military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts calculated share each of the five channels to supply the black market with illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="670"> In 2011, a report was written by the Center for problem analysis and state administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for government statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators from the Army and the legal protection authorities. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of all weapons on the black market are tirelessly to get through the &quot;debt of leaders, which have to do with weapons in their work,&quot; it says in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the data, the researchers 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% back to thefts of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A sale of a weapons store, which does not want to be named assured that weapons, which can be found in illegal excavations, nobody buys for a long time, since they are out of date. </seg>
<seg id="676"> According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supply in an arms depots. </seg>
<seg id="677"> For example, on an ensign a weapon, a gun is bought by the type of TT. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,&quot; he tells </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;The police, of course, knows about everything and, therefore, if they do not comply with the plan to the detection of crime, periodically Kontrollkäufe dealers, the illegal weapons sales consultants offer,&quot; which adds. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in the luxury &apos; </seg>
<seg id="682"> Buyers and sellers find most well-known to each other. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I had seen my websites and blogs, as someone who was to draw attention to myself and I proposed to come to the station &quot;Begowaja,&quot; where a person would be waiting for me, which would like to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price for the only weapon I learned there </seg>
<seg id="685"> Military commentator Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="686"> &quot;I need to get a weapon, a well-known, the contacts,&quot; which tells sales consultant. &quot;I have such a well-known, but I do not trust him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code as &quot;by Ivan Iwanowitsch, which set up the subsidiary that has lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> I am currently even in some of the rings on a well-known, whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He also gives me the key rings only because he knows that I am not verpfeife him. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Newcomers are searching for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes have not changed, according to him. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He got a photo album, in the &quot;everything&quot; was shown. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like in the luxury,&quot; recalls of military personnel. </seg>
<seg id="695"> According to the buyer gets Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I do not simply as a potential customer purchase, but the seller in the forest, and this is where we set a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other,&quot; the expert describes the action. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shopping </seg>
<seg id="699"> Internet search engines search results to websites and groups in &quot;VKontakte,&quot; where weapons are being offered &quot;for different purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> There will not be any papers still needs, there are personal meetings. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;You need just the right amount of money,&quot; it says in the advertisement on the website &quot;combat gun or rifle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> There, users give up their orders and ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> It is also sold to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Of course, without a license,&quot; user &quot;Ivan&quot; asks (direct quote). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;Buy a TT.&quot; Moscow, the laconic request from &quot;Fedorenkow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Security Service recently shifted countless Web sites, and who want to purchase weapons, shoppers are crowding into the network. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then land in Siberia and shovels coal </seg>
<seg id="708"> Military kommentator and former military members Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard from following scheme: the website is registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The officials take the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer transfers the money via an automatic teller machines. </seg>
<seg id="712"> In response, &quot;he receives a photo and a description of the captivity of arms,&quot; said the press spokesman of the non-profit organization, &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; reports Dmitri Kislow. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranez stressed that one can come to the conclusion, empty and locked up, if you placed a question on a Web page. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service recently shifted countless Web sites, and who want to purchase weapons, shoppers are crowding into the network. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camps and shovels coal,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="716"> A Makarow for $100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> When buying illegal firearms, according to experts is to be expected with prices from $100 to 900. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislow of the organization, &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> You have to wait for up to one and a half months. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The weapon will be spent in military arsenals of middle-class. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal weapons throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand back, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the United States almost food- and supermarkt- workers strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting behind the cash from Mc Donald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days it was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald&apos;s, Burger King, taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Yet no one can predict whether the protests will continue, or whether you soon the air goes out. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and almost food- employees, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far this sector of the economy is hardly organized trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, which were held in the United States, the Ausverkäufe attracted millions of customers, which has led to sometimes to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Cannibalizing sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries up to dust extractors, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only on their own work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Prices and product lines were cannibalizing to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics often cannibalizing the goods can only sell so cheap, because the employees are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about working conditions, for example, lack of forklift or scanner. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the protests on &quot;Black Friday,&quot; asked for wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart employees, which earned 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increases the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost. </seg>
<seg id="741"> The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay. </seg>
<seg id="742"> To make the wage increases would be cannibalizing fully to the customers, they cost more in the future only 46 cents. </seg>
<seg id="743"> That would be a year for you today, compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Advocates of cannibalizing satisfied to note that it was only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period cannibalizing sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, the Walmart funds led to the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees work and the protest only &quot;another PR stunt,&quot; the union, which organized the protests, was. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, where their objective, however, were not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and that is why so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and other low-priced restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, the minimum wage legislation in accordance with federal and New York is $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food restaurants will raise the minimum wage, but not too strong, and the average in their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No less than they deserved in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible, to come to New York with so little money, incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was once upon a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s people who complain that they have to come up with this wage and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&apos;s in the Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants will receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance, to stand in the way this objective and to urge union members or to fire. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the company makes it will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The most important reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day Lautstarke protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The climax of the protests was a meeting at midday before the McDonald&apos;s at the Times Square, in which some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we should support the fast-food staff together, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, which everyone deserves New York!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are far from being employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands of work in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain can trick has been only moderately,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technologies popular theme of the enlarged reality is perceived lately, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Google first presented in summer at its annual conference in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had filed a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In the interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It irritates the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please describe what their research group operates. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - we are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the humanity is largely stuck in the phase, worked in the pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touches. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want to look 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the new generation sensors, a step forward, and today no longer being sold without, as all interested in motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - even though the interaction on a physical level, much still unfolding on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decided. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that work on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make fassbarer. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To do this, it is necessary, however, that it is not only the users, but also its surroundings is detected. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could complement the real world much easier through virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And we should first and foremost this bescheuerten virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> What do you think about language control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - it is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always like to inform all the others about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact any kind of interaction is good with computers, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, instead of with sweeping gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet, which registered the movements of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is a relatively large, however, in theory, could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But on the whole, however, the future belongs mixed types of control, for example, gesture and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - like that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - me, for example, we would ask you to them Sprudeldose? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it, and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to detect. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - in other words, they want that adapts to the user what can make a machine at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - not necessarily, but we are talking about a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that we will have to work in the near future, particularly on the development of new types that allow us to capture reactions from people in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This could be, for example, laser sensors, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - which claims on the basis of their work with the Xbox 360 the new generation sensors on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be a bad thing. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> So all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It must not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the z-axis will be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also, the speed and the number of frames per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of people are extremely dynamic and open said, are the current 30 fps, especially for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I needed for my work as a device, only without the touch-control and with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - the number of cameras should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - is currently working with three cameras, with one of them, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> They are not used to calculate the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Perhaps more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The new generation would be a flexible, similar system in which we could play with different camera inclinations, to determine how it helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - if I remember correctly, Microsoft presented to the public, in contrast to Google his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, it is not pleasant to hold a smartphone in hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a &quot;changing&quot; extended reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of glasses on the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private can only see them), but also its weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses that they can work together with other virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - we imagine for a moment that the virtual holograms manipulation in the air, not only from the Iron Man, but also accessible to ordinary mortals. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group wants to give to this objection? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - in my lectures, I often assume that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as something unusual projection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It performs excellently pressure. </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are, in fact, to give the &quot;pictures in the air,&quot; something tangible, for example, the interference of some ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, however, when someone these fallen on the palm. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the wrist, which affect the Nervenendungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - they have tried to outflank the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> It is thought that it is what it should be, if it looks like something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - it is a good idea, so we have tried it yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another task, with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a man who physically located in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms as well as large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain can outsmart only moderately, and that there are still a lot of work ahead of us rich years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: on many issues, we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Instead of their own culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt continues the project &quot;avant-garde,&quot; which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the list have already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and who often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt of extravagant artists Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Miller, the bearded, dressed in red and one time at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden scene meetings or at openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Miller, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Miller is one of the typical of St. Petersburg social philosophical artists, the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Miller is a luminous personality of the avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and conjures up by his presence on the street for his fellow citizens a smile in the face and makes you a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg summertime, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his life, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Why, for example, you&apos;re not actually always in red and yellow or turquoise in the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Everything in the society, which deviates from the norm, aggression and bad behavior. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But I want to get through my provocations with the people in the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when you know that you need to be? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - at an exhibition in the Cultural Palace, in which my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that I have to go down this path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there is the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter came to an end at the time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; &quot;Rachmaninow&quot; and then once was concluded. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It attracts me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, in fact, apart from the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - and all the united in your kind of clinic... - it was important for me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best new artist should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a space in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there until the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Bohemians. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: name., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, as with his project &quot;Ucho van Goga&quot; came there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore T-shirts, and also to you today&apos;s hottest composer Igor Wdowin belonged. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, was removed from the &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> The costume moderated many programs before the time of &quot;Halli Galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them the costume, and it began his career, but he learned the basics with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Even the gallery &quot;d 137,&quot; or the club &quot;Griboedov&quot; have their origin in the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees and regulars were there. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, as culture meant something else. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;Artist of the Year,&quot; and so I had reached the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your works have an unmistakable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - many of my pictures are genuine pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of the ideas expressed. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibition with the theme &quot;the Russian Museum as clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> In the past, I was afraid of social, but now it hurts and is preparing to be the case. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now everyone respects the clothes and is based on the outside, not the inside of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not be a people&apos;s hands, but should he spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception will disappear by dressing up. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today, commercial art must be careful and considerate and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people were the other major groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to fall. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you have to think you, whom thou shalt case. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each about 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - to the performances of Stas Michailow, however, several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - abandoned women come to him, where the social sphere plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less money, and all perish. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have supporters, and the most important thing is that you do not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty in order to rejected time and money. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Petersburg - what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> One says: servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have experts who could be, but you will be the road, because it requires hochrangigerer experts who assess the former right and make them the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now only one&apos;s own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that you have to say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Petersburg - which is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones art can grow up is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="927"> For example, we need a cultural ferment, because we now have more writers as readers, and that is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded by grants in the town of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or clash with killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space ships with planet aboard on the search for a replacement. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, the important question is how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> In my opinion, there is not a lot of choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Mars and Venus,&quot; says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> While the conditions on Mars, however, are relatively friendly, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all the possible. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The question of reproduction in all the researchers treated first in terms of the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already half a century earlier experiments have been carried out with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the difference in orbit bred peas are not in the least by the terrestrial species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of the tiny fruit flies (), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It has developed a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without a solid surface the chicks tripping over their tongues. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn fully. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks responded to light and loud. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Four days later, they simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;Twice we let slip chicks and made the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all records. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, only to be located on the bio-satellite &quot;Bion&quot; homosexual species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which have already been sent in the fertilized. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was found nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just the bio-satellites, but once again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued,&quot; Vladimir Sychew noticed. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing of the space rats were young. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproductive directly in space could not resolve so far. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is a difficult one. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, who will travel from their natural habitat cannot simply follow their reproduction. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to the human animals could in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> From the ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women have been flying in all 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="969"> It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most valuable asset that has humanity, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew them, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> They will be able to bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, nobody answered that question,&quot; says veteran Wachtang Watschnadse space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew was also kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even if work outside of the space vehicle gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonauts, where, after long flights everything went well, and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in orbit,&quot; cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and concludes hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Hydrolabor in the centre of the Cosmonaut is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in a state of flux the Cosmonaut routine win for the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is, as the small Ichtyander would bear witness that life in the country rose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother is in the water, and the water that it can then make it easier to get used to. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget about something,&quot; says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur speed back and thus also takes the ability to press the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we go through geburtseinleitende tools. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?,&quot; which is not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without having to feel the earth attraction, the organism can&apos;t form the skeleton and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child cannot be put in orbit as an adult to the training in a suit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He is simply the absence of what is of fundamental importance for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment will mean that we will have a disabled person, a completely unadapted people to the world,&quot; the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in the world is all mere theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, however, it will be a reality, when the earth&apos;s inhabitants to break into your space ships to a distant planet, which will be the home for their offspring born in all. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, falls back in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the interview for Aktuálne.cz of Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case with us,&quot; said Kala commented on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> Prime Minister Petr Necas as a negative example he leads the attitude to the so-called &quot;black system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system now is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have its validity, however, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not just the chairman of the government, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work,&quot; Kala notes. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel review, with which we have started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Easier said, it is important that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislation and, finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> This is all we have compared with each other, and even though the review is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are with us, maybe even a little &quot;strict and perfect,&quot; the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to establish, always new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How you can be an aid project? What emerges from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is precisely such a joint control could help that we stop to constantly strive for a perfect balance of the laws and the lowering of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing to purchase at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and rule out unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It is perhaps even in such a way that we are only the excessive burden on the system in this way, &quot;paperwork,&quot; and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to use the system, as if the threshold were higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What is the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only a little differently, but fundamentally similar work both authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are courts of auditors in the individual Länder - is the German system differs from our. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the land audit offices there. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards the German legislation, it is easier than our? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would compare this reluctant without any concrete information. However, in a sense, is often described Germany as a model, but you can certainly not say, however, that Germany is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Perhaps it is that the auditors are better there? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This is not determined, but as I said: I don&apos;t particularly like comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to contend with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards the Czech legislation, which had meaning for their authority, the revision of the public procurement law, you already feel any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our controls take place later, you have to expect here with a certain amount of delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We feel so far more impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and examined and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with further bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption has been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules are &quot;severe,&quot; and can no longer be adhered to. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous rules are an audit of the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, accountable to the Regional Council) to the effect that any breach of the public procurement law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But then it is useful to make the law even stricter? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think that in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a mistake, which does not affect the actual decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is only the bureaucracy under greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out here? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Firstly, we say, which is not targeted way. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called &quot;black system&quot; - what does that mean exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The black system is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the government can not come easy chair, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &apos;we change the law and allow the matter, &quot;but he could not say that we are doing so, as if nothing would. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded solely because of errors. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that is what is missing from us. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> There is some Eisglätte on the streets, but they are mostly dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of snow and Eisglätte is partly in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> On the contrary, however, the roads are good, sometimes increased caution is needed. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the district of Karlovy Vary were the streets this morning, there was snow and Eisglätte. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperature fell to -5 to -10 ° C, there should be a little warmer during the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> Snow in the region, and it is no longer in the lower altitudes only a thin snow remains. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The combing of the Ore Mountains are, however, about 30 cm snow. </seg>

<seg id="1063"> The highway r6 and the routes of the first class in the region are currently fully accessible. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> However, attention is needed, for example on bridges, where the roads are sometimes crampon and smooth. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All roads in the second and third class, including the mountain roads are also. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> On these roads, however, remain section or ausgefahrene snow remains. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Therefore, increased attention is needed, especially in the higher altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Districts pardubice and Hradec Kralove </seg>
<seg id="1069"> On some streets in eastern danger because Eisglätte, at higher altitudes and in the mountains is located on the streets are sometimes a ausgefahrene snow layer, with shares the roads and highway principals on their websites. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The Straßenmeistereien Eisglätte warning drivers that can occur, especially in higher altitudes in the district of pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> In particular, it can come to Eisglätte on traffic due to the second and third class in Ústí nad Orlicí Lanškroun circles, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto. </seg>

<seg id="1073"> Snow, in particular, on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické Hory. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> A ausgefahrene snow layer is located at elevations on the streets of Rychnov nad Knežnou and timetables. </seg>

<seg id="1079"> This is the morning chill, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> As it has snowed in advance, and then the temperature fell, it can come on the streets to Eisglätte. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> It is to be expected with fog, with the view, however, will improve in the course of the day. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> These figures come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The D5 motorway is virtually unlimited, increased attention the Straßenmeistereien recommend, however, between 80th and 131 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The first-class are mostly dry, but freezing. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> However, in the south of the circles pilsen and Tachov, it can come to Eisglätte section. </seg>

<seg id="1092"> In the other areas of the district which roads are passable. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> &quot;In the Šumperk snow remains still remain in the altitudes. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that the world should take place in less than a month? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is a disaster of those messages, to which we are so happy to jump to people. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band, The tap tap to make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can gather enough positive energy, to stop or to prevent the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December they realize there is a unique project with three concerts against the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> You can imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21: 00. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone around 12 hours before us, the Mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> This idea comes from whom? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally from me, then we have shaped the idea, together with our graphic Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In doing so, we would like to not only collect sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the world, but we also want to consider, along with the public about the state of the world we once handed over to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key fobs us against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The tap tap has included, along with other performers also the so-called national anthem against the doomsday titled &quot;world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. It will be performed on the charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, and certainly not to conclude, provided that everything works, and the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The national anthem should be sung by all of the performers on all three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit of the Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem by Tomáš HANÁK, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl x sings with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> As you have come to the cooperation with the two? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which relates to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to involve us, these people in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts benefits against the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we are already working together for six years with the club tap in the Jedlicka Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Students of the Institute of Jedlicka are regularly maintained by editors, which will help you in different leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Since the students themselves do not have the resources to seek the editors, we want to help you in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the completion of the Institute of Jedlicka its own building should be created, in which we have a draw with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A number of groups and performers at each concert occur. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria they have chosen this? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, China, support lesbiens, Illustratosphere occur with Dan Czech, the tap tap, Marián Bango and JIRÍ. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar &quot;big venues,&quot; are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - it would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their plans are not very small, so far, they have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is, however, a group, which is composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with these logistical and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. Also, of course, we need to carry a lot of luggage and other luggage... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always been worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised to find myself sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through its foreign trips, you have a comparison, etc., as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks like, how to deal with people with disabilities </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How do you have seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East is still everything in its creation. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Moscow is absolutely not vis-à-vis Prague for disabled people. There, it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone in the center of the city is on the way. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is still not there, of course, that you can be a wheelchair users, for example, in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are clubs that try to point out to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things that we depend on... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> This is to say that an improvement in the situation depends on the efforts of the people affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities move independently in the public space, go to the museum, you can use toilets, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the social events, we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> In respect of the public and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only cases of particularly strong personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what has motivated in 1998 to found a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> At that time, I started as a supervisor in the Jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people, who were keen to deal with something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician and saxophone games, I have founded, along with a colleague, a music AG. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and by the time this is how our moderator to say Láa Angelovic, something out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known, but only in the last few years, or I am wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation has helped with well-known singers; in addition, we have also begun to advertise for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> To us, it has become aware that if you are doing something and not to be seen from the outside, it is its own performance in a certain sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Moreover, thanks to the EU funding, we can afford to do good, high-quality equipment and, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was their goal, to bring it with the tap tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I have felt the potential that we can address the things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In the showbusiness often copied today one of the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is on its way, logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are only a few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression that the viewer has usually is, of course, pity; that is, of course, only... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because there is no isolated and abandoned creatures are people with disabilities, which we would regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who can live a full life and develop, as long as they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, this is a step forward, not only for themselves, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was also useful for this success, that you are a strong leader, as we hear from many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, you can go in many things no compromises and demand must also be a certain degree of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and then if you need to see that they have twice a week, complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm for many. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> So it works, but everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At present, the tap tap twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the very beginning, i.e. since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láa Angelovic. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. The people come and go. We cannot prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate with us is always welcome. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> 20.12.2012 will take place on the day before the forecasts of doom, Thursday at 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Ostrava / Plynojem; 12 Czech bands and other musicians </seg>
<seg id="1192"> All three venues are connected to the final circuit via live with each other, and it sounds like a common interpretation of the anthem &quot;world&quot; of the band The tap tap. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled education center that is to be created under the name of STUDEO in the cost: 25 million CZK Jedlicka Institute in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA and participated in the following years on several projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before the Second World War, Polish workers with the space, but they do not always understand. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work &quot;entrance to the Kosmonautik.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the Kosmonautik&quot; by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André-Léonard Louis deer donated Prix rep Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major supporter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the crater was named after him on the side of the moon erdabgewandten. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 a railway trolley was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is still not clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to slow down the trolley. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The details come exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But the research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 of ING appeared in the press on Rohozinski draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and in the following year, the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from passing by scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, however, his work was finished by the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other articles on the space appear after World War II, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society is carried out in 1954 in the November issue of the journal, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to see that the exploration of space would have a future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This office he held until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 kilometers and come to use for the observation of high winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, the further development has been stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> His successor in the first missiles of the type developed the Meteor missile was in the years of 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor missile had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-0.62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions of the meteor-2H and Meteor-3 have been built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Also worth noting the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, is on the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national committee COSPAR. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland also participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos on space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on non-profit work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision caused a lively discussion in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) there is tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept of a state is to understand, in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheaper goods in the economic competition, he offers the competition &quot;to bring down a larger market share and to increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In the large-scale, this means, for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy there, or to give up, but your business. The result is comparable to a high level of unemployment in countries with high labor costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily increased government spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and thereby to replace the overall social economic and social damage caused by them. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to reduce the social level of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments provide its own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in particular changes in applicable laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of pay. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is happening on the one hand, economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The results are growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> A few years ago in Germany there have been public food outlets for poor people, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of those affected is in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which workers receive such a low wages, that the state needs to increase their income to the minimum subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was revealed in the case of workers in the German Bundestag auxiliary staff. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all the EU&apos;s southern states will no doubt on the state of the same amount, in which the people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels (as happened in the 19th century), or to languish for a pittance on the fringes of society, and to hope that it will eventually go private investment capital in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here, the question naturally arises as to where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of a country in the other; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at the employees&apos; wages for a fraction of the European work. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not be involved with capital to its own economy, and that economy will lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The narrow-minded private capital insisting on his position that the state should not interfere in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then we must ask whether the policy is not the private capital, and thus the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all Member States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual benefit, a legislation, in which everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department hires private lack of finances, dense with industrial companies with the drafting of bills. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills will be passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Then all violence is no more of the people, as it is announcing the western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously, the liberal democracies are currently in a situation where, as you Appian in his work to the crisis of the Roman Republic at times and describes: &quot;the state was for a long time in the collapse, and the offices were filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Grease money through illegal or fraudulent benefits with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Corruption has already grown incontinent, and the people went with bought votes on the election, &quot;...&quot; People with character applied for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul &quot;...&quot; You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine is an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man needs to be elected... &quot;Appian thought while Pompey, but the strong man Caesar, who was then replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, as in ancient times today&apos;s society is based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without having to pay attention to societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is by its nature is not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, who are not in the least to in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we need to search in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Seen from the current state of affairs, the sinking of these regimes can be seen in favour of liberal democracies as some pause, during which the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, face in total ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on non-profit work here is not the solution, or at least no lasting. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to put the social level of the population down. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is more targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;... That nothing comes from violence, or ever could,&quot; Sting sings in the song, which is the most important verse in the chorus: &quot;... So that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons wanted no wars, there would be no,&quot; says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild family&apos;s reputation, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> According to the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with which the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who in these recurring waves of killing Schuldiger and who is the victim; at the end of the day, today&apos;s residents of Israel were born, including the self-governing territories in the current political situation, and we have not seen the beginning of the violence itself. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It is a matter for me to open the readers to look behind the scenes look at who is 95 years voltage (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small country in the Middle East, in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we will be able to make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were themselves, the specific steps, or whether someone was behind the throne, which drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time in which the world&apos;s wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under this astronomical rich families, which could be described as head of the Kraken (I do not know whether someone is still about them, but I do not agree with this) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> A great deal will not write about it. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably,. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to prevent the connection of your name with high criminal, whose background is always to consolidate its power, the propagation of their assets, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to these (before the raid on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the raid on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia, in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has also always tries to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to give out during the civil war, its own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to give out their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis MC Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed due to the world economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global power lust of the Rothschilds resulted in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulating a plan to free three world wars by Albert pik, a Masonic of the 33rd, and thus the highest degree of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war had to remove the target, the essence of Europe, by the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the global population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their facilities and their luxury and would also not consume so many resources) to create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up), and finally to the takeover of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (Order from Chao - order from the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the Fed&apos;s founding, so that crises such as the one you do not recur in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After it was able to resolve them by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the first world war, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian empire, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to be able to the Second World War, the bankers could spark created by the policy, a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the condition deprived masses, so they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the culprits and simple solutions offered Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth columnists, and also to stir up the war fire. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as possible on the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There have been terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain, which had initially kept the international bankers, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as by the war reparations against Germany was preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If it is the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, similar to the Jewish people during the Second World War to the victims in the front line, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only of how to divide the people of supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the culprit, and who was the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelites, where only unjust in an endless spiral of violence triggers, and at the beginning of the greed and their pursuit of global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we must distinguish between the people of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for the election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable, the international bankers loyal devoted politician, who is doing everything to stir up a war with Iran, which could in the face of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly spread to a global conflict, and it could be because of Iran&apos;s control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world&apos;s oil supplies to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: &quot;the only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every new-born babies at birth a chip implanted to subject of this nature of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that small and large, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all the time on your right hand or on your forehead that nobody can buy or sell, he had the time, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, anyone who has understood the reasoning, the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> It is a number of people, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: if Hollywood&apos;s worst call </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> For their release they called for the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the revolution in the United States, which had maintained over the decades, the patronage of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would have damaged confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, it was not in a position to put in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation made everything worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats have been freed after 444 days after negotiations were conveyed by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter&apos;s against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film director and actor Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo describes an episode of this story, which cost the US a small part of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Immediately prior to the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story to cover their true identity helped them - they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly disguised as members of a Filmstabes, who visited locations in the country for a science fiction movie. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan developed by the experts for &quot;Exfiltration&quot;, Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation in Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So the camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a special combination of several Filmgenres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic, but at the same time a so-called &quot;Bob Movie,&quot; i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks as, for example, the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically, and therefore come easily. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the office corridors, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable start of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a losing has become a respected director, actor, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third film Gone Baby Gone, according to the playground (2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is not Afflecks first film, which plays in the Boston of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that lifted the previous films of this director of the standard Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense, but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story moves. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect achieved Affleck with his team, with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with the fact that the story is, in fact, not many people in the cinematic scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He works with a few but quite successfully, although he sometimes helps the reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis averted at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway have contrived something). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of the ARGO is to have his too-wide spread, which is caused by the need to show too much to many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and that they are far from alone in the film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film loses traction. It is a movie that you can follow with some interest and approving the design and a thriller from the 1970s retro style. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> However, he awakens enthusiasm is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder to a living piece of history until today in some way, and as proof, such as excessive, but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls annually a survey about the oddest bank charges, decided this year to hold the competition &quot;absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;This idea of recently brought to us by the EU&apos;s plan to introduce a women&apos;s quota of 40% in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, compared to the newspaper Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women is located. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they represent a lower risk for the insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Further incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, &quot;Nacher said. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of ethanol fuel, which is in its follow-up naturschädigend, furthermore, banning mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because the eggs in this year have been much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> In the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter&quot; or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas must be 14 cm long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in general are represented by one or more member countries (as the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to push through, with veto threat, the demands of Czech banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not an &quot;anomaly&quot; exhibit. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended with the argument that they only harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would impede trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables have already been watered down by the EU against the opposition of some countries, with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU invoked an American study, which, in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of the suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction already applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious, cross-border raids at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> It is also relatively absurd - a directive that concerns the European officials themselves, everyone in the EU, which occupies an official function must not be used because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece, the name of Macedonia and instead must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks on the territory of a member country. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU set the Hoechstvolumen food stocks, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume set for fungal canned foods, and a large fine threatened us. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to ensure that they have no sea, or by the idea, however, to provide funding for applications for funding. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will apply to the EU, &quot;said in autumn 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and overcrowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases goods. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The Czech Republic as another way to ports, according to the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Finally, the European Commission was the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically, it should act to promote funding for the limits of money applications to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although regulations in the Member States are easy to the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and thus deserves to efficiency and development of the entire European Union according to some experts, however, more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A more serious problem, according to these experts, the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, which were, however, imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member countries. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions cause is the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other member countries in Brussels to fight for the right to use of specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic was able to defend after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term &quot;Olomoucké tvaružky, the residents (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but in our manufacturers have had to rename&quot; Tuzemák. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of products registered in the EU, the Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohorelice and Trebon, or even the more hops appear in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> With an EU trademark Pardubicer gingerbread or the Horicer breasts roles. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> &quot;The people that I want to save the republic, but I am just an amateur,&quot; Okamura claims. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how the idea to stand for the office of president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not my intention to be a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything would work in our country without any problems, I would stand anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see how the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves, will be increased during the people, taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to become politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see what I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I&apos;m already over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things, rather than to run for senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> They have succeeded in the Senate and then straight on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> They would not return to their voters back? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I told myself all the time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the result of the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I made it and said that I am going to run for the office of president, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> However, the problem is not only that we rail as people in the pub, and in front of the TV, but anyone who wants to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The media who want to rob an honour, and confusing to lie the freedom of speech with freedom. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, has been said about me, that I would bribe journalists or that I was consultant from JIRÍ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about their visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The battle for the castle, they have taken with the idea of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do this, you need to change the laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it will be rejected, and that keeps the population. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party I have a much greater potential to win support for all the parties represented in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party, which is the best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> They see themselves as a human being in politics rather than right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the point of view of Czech, it seems to me that the people see me more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this right left thinking, however, is totally unimportant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we can move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> For me, it is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right, I would like to connect the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from, or from the Czech Republic, and I shall also speak against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It is not like you, if someone calls you as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But they do not confirm what you have just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you are a company in a business plan, then you also have an ideal destination and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And that you are approaching. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, already work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament keywords. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And so you come in the policy does not go far in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people who will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to implement these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As President, there would be no problem for me, to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the raised would have to say why they reject it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which points to abuses can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take only once the direct election of the president, who was an achievement of the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the policy I just started and trying to find my program for the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn&apos;t work, then I go back in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I am not alone; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities whether they do not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have spoken with, for example, radim Jancura, which refused, however, due to overwork. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure any more. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, and those who are mostly gone, have elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are now only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and district of the main men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the creation of your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought about it, because I don&apos;t have time to review the past every potential party member, and also do not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> They have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> They talk of assets declarations, how would their? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu, which is worth about a million, and then I still have a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was, in fact, a children&apos;s dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was in the car drove, Galant to women and, at the same time, fought against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> They say that they want to change the Republic, but they do not want to invest their own money. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should make some debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In fact, the cost of the campaign will be covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senator salary alone I could not live; so I could, for example, my son is not the English school funding, which costs 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> In other words, they remain more than entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> They said that they will not cut back on these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that does not depend on the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have reduced some of my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy in spring, CEO of the travel agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want to see me as a Good Samaritan, which saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must do something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> They were accustomed to monthly income as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is to continue. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I would put my activities, however. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is to see something interesting,&quot; says Verhaig, a Passantin on the roadside. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby says: &quot;it is that house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet access, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No human being is voluntarily today in one of these old-style libraries, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, sonderbarer record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80,000 residents of community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To curb this stupid circumstance, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general education and to build the seven bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to become the statistics: a library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> , winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took the matter with their usual serenity and appeared at the hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked nonplussed and wincing with the armpits, Esspecially Freche Maas his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and ended his speech with the words: &quot;love an actionist founded municipality!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> In other words, that is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is dug up. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> He is part of a revitalization project, which also include parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November the books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> So the faceless town retort that no longer had to offer so far as a post-modern pedestrian and an ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: books Eldorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and read the fußläufigen climb the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The all-round glazed interior is bright and well-structured, the ceramic Klinkerboden and elegant street speak the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It already holds for banking, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually way too expensive and impersonal,&quot; says winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have asked the classic space configuration upside down and read the area from the inside to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the books is cleverly used: in the middle of offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and headquarters are located. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are wall panelling, parapet, rose close countries. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel and smell are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work here with recycled materials,&quot; Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we have encountered in a friesländischen farm of one day on a waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, is used in the Netherlands in glasshouses and fields a thin plastic woven as the root surface. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> The fleece was pressed for the library - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, material that smells a little after new cars and a little after sports shoe. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps one has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys will be rewarded in the literary cafe, not only with a fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe it, yes, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book is under a glass of fall, the sun itself seems just on sunny days in the interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad Holzleimbinder, which are across the glass facade, serve as shades and intercept a large part of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The room climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Fully automatic blinds do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry has already ventured to go the way of the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Also Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, who described the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses &quot;long overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> In order to be filled the gaps in the still not fully stocked library - currently 70,000. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is absorbed. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled to obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship to this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only to grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> MVRDV succeeded so that those who are called in the jargon identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has written literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> They also may be so young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is finally a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;German must play a greater role,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the motion of the Palestinians&apos; observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then contained Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany must be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> At the same time, however, I believe that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it comes to set up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was, after all, enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy and away from a policy that has been gemanaged, so to speak, by the United States, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Compounding that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The German is therefore find themselves between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> One expects from them that they play a more independent role, but not because they are accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What is a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It also shows the willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, in other words, the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful, the general public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not the head. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want to attach too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is definitely plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, it has abstained in important decisions, such as when the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this was a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany will play a certain amount of respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> There are different opinions in Europe to the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Due to the American domestic politics these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> However, due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not so big, as they always appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu&apos;s policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that this is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can&apos;t be part of a broader line and instead must push things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Just make it with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to push Europe into a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as a major international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The lead or Germany is still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not yet accustomed to the fact that the country is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role in a wide variety of anti-German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It is not just the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who remains otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like it, and there is still a lot more unpopular makes it - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, a research institute, academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together on the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;&quot; trademark protection in China: if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind an officially registered designation in China, which has nothing to do with the company, however, hides. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, as long as they do not accuse protection, such as the actual name. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether they get right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; said Thomas Patt hole, lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The other countries have indicated a few additional letters enough so that they are not allowed to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Lu Gucci, Prada will simply enter from Gucci, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Stand-off hole opens up a folder with entries of the PCT in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company, the trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are the world champions in copying and the injured intellectual property rights, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the large cities there are stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But Pattlochs cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call the &quot;bang Mingpai,&quot; a passenger mark. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> This means that women are rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;This is, we must fight it,&quot; calls for stand-off hole. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be diluted, which disappears, the image damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion in the year of the third-largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But DELETION dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years, the process can drag, with an uncertain end. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because the name was rejected after the long duration of the &quot;market has become a reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff misfortune, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also affect graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must therefore today use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue and white logo, which reminded BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would look at the famous crocodile in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> In the past year, but it was returned by the &quot;emergency in the workflow to normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> You almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, are still waiting in the office 81.500 appeals to carry out. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It costs a lot to deal </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often happens in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications were CTMO on trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It was a record and means that China for the 10th time in a row, the list of new registrations in all over the world, who shares with authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This means that any simplified registration costs, on average, 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> It costs a lot to go against it, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years ago, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> It is true that the Germans have been able to achieve its illegal manufacturing imitierter motor vehicle parts was dug. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed to do that, because in Germany family names could not be protected, hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical says in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Indeed, the trademark office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two instances Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We must be careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;this process is extremely time-consuming and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could hardly figure, the company archives have seen even one hundred years old files to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; to the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;You can see how much it is worth to us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East are threatening to spread to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, when there will secure unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You have to be careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the Council&apos;s lawyer stalemate hole German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It was not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should register &quot;everything which is somehow deserving, as well as in China,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, in the last act: if Freudenberg under his trademark drama, then we would have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we are being pushed into the segment in question from the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: noise, singing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg imbongi - and AIDS orphans in Swaziland rejoice. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a connection that transcends far more than 8733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, there is the plan: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor, find it quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then press the voices of the singers - old, bass, tenor and soprano, and track. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The 29-year-old conductor, and Fiete Hopf, it almost highlights from his shoes, if he brings together with his smooth wild gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg rehearsing the choir imbongi a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers and singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin up to the house. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;OM Obani is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and that even in a very foreign language: Zulu, which will be from 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and spoken in parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> There are around 34 million infected with HIV, which estimates Unaids, the program of the United Nations for the use of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million people live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa found in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attending secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the children&apos;s school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily in the gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or even Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The Bantu language fluently speak can sing, but no one in this area. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost ten years ago, the choir songs in this foreign language and also brings you and then back to where it was originally: in the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Around 2000 people living there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a majority of whom are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have no more parents, because they are prey to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni worldwide, according to UNICEF is reflected in the small, Swaziland suffers from the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Circumcision of male foreskin, which reduce the risk of infection can be proven to be adopted by the half of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland Immunschwäche virus to die with mid-thirty is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, it is not only those who lack of parental responsibility, but simply: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> No school has no chance in a poor country. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still the private individual to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later, the association &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; which cares professionally since almost to the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni founded the choir. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts to sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STI syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and Tripper (). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI HIV, humane Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Crab and itch are among the parasitic STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the main parties concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> The heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren are often sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexuals adults comparatively small - yet: around 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other populations. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here are also often humane Pappilomaviren among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections developed? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 at 3698 diseases more than doubled in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms point to a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, as well as complaints urinated, flow, Unterbauchschmerzen vesicles or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through infections and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend especially frequently changing sex partners regular check-ups. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the STI diagnosed early can be cured and avoid late consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fees that ersingt the choir in Germany, CosmoCode yields. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We have already sent a total of about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association. </seg>

<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence that there are Mercury ice on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice may be up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe have found evidence that there is an ice in the region permanently in the shadow of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> They should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably came from comets or asteroids that are taken on the Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> But nobody put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed by the earth&apos;s citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, to explore the depths of space. </seg>

<seg id="1834"> Researchers suspect that it is only a short time after the Big Bang, primarily hydrogen was to be found in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our insight into all: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope should have been invented by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei set up a year later to the star observation. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights that they deliver, deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It looks to be in the same all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner life of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Construction: the telescope is ground to a halt in his elevation - and thus limited in his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its special feature: the high light gathering force. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is enough - despite the comparatively low mirror diameter - the world&apos;s largest telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the alien signals. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> &quot;In the&quot; search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by putting more computing power available. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Overlooking the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the NASA&apos;s Hubble Space Telescope, which makes his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four reflect the telescope will be able to shine in the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Also on the Chilean observatory was NASA&apos;s Hubble Space Telescope is being planned. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should include whopping 42 meters - and will be set from nearly 1,000 mirror elements together. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> But with the images until at least 2018 is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They offer two levels with an average of 10 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, along with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Also on the Mauna Kea is intended to create a new, huge telescope, with an average of 30 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> It is here to gaze on an illustration. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble supplies. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the search for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the picture, the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at the earliest 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: there are looking for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists assume that there is also ice on the south pole of the Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements have for decades that there is ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one might think that being in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, which borders with Iran is only a few kilometers away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Aserisch and is very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> The terminal is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town flaunts to powerfully meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan&apos;s capital, Baku. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Lerik Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the vehicle to the tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here, the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years ago, a children&apos;s shows </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which is supposed to be 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is not a birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And in the face of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born here in the region, and he died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years ago, he is said to have a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So has irali Müslümov charged at his age for a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;There are also striking many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to the lack of documentation no scientific proof to bring about the age, given that person was missing. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, melted butter becherweise </seg>
<seg id="1908"> But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking a Biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why do so many elderly live here in the south? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But that it is precisely the kalorienreiche Talyschen should be as healthy, especially the love meat, bread and milk products, many of which have daily drinking a glass of melted butter, from a nutritional point of view, not just seems plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years for this is still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> And 143 descendants Mirzayeva, which claims to have lived in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the ground back and forth rolls with butter, which you worked tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are grandparents. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two infants also jump around. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing the tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly under her headscarf conceals a long, dark blond braids, which reveals her son proudly in front of us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I washed my hair with milk, so you never went out and retained their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough to life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eat only what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the most serious in the period after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev Aliyew took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult, which will drive the father figure of the nation, ruled his country like a dictator knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Until 2003, he was in power, and later his son, Ilham took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no emergency, Azerbaijan&apos;s old. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva, 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) per month as a pension, a sum for local conditions, from which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps has also long been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: &quot;the old enjoy in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are living in the midst of the large family, are loved, and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human rights&quot; is missing in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo seems to be the deep divisions in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president with pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to create the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And that he succeeds, it is my responsibility, before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was aimed at the whole nation, but, above all, to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because they have all been hopelessly in a confused opposition, fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> He did so, said Mohamed Morsi almost excuse the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and its powers expanded, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate of the American University of Southern California, save really wants the Egyptians, the world is not entirely in the clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary should be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt, partial worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the law on the principles &quot;Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is called &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was, and is, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will take advantage of the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least that sets a new article hinzugeführter close: in all matters relating to the Sharia al-Azhar University should be held to the rate, the most important Islamic institution in the country, with great power throughout the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would lead to the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the interpretation is Verfassunsgsentwurf </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These dishes served during Mubarak&apos;s rule on the suppression of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state should also protect, as it is in the draft, &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and promote their morals and values. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> This is legally formulated so blurred that state institutions could control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain English that means nothing other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, there is no article stipulates equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> It bans or another to insult the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Just as questionable is the wording, the &quot;insulting people,&quot; was banned. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurist? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Morsi interpretation, like so much in the draft, which will be presented before the signature and according to his words, &quot;very soon,&quot; the Egyptians to the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution is back,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition formed for weeks against the power of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the charter to fall, even before they can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is back, and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said, the draft Constitution &quot;belong to the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> He accused via short message service Twitter followers Morsi to want to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him,&quot; said the opposition persuade Yasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren has yet to be paid,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced, do not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew on the counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile river in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and cried: &quot;the people calling for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded by Morsi: &quot;don&apos;t use the country!&quot; And promised: &quot;the Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, had summoned warlike conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> This obviously did not want to risk Morsi&apos;s supporters. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said, both the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time to be decided, the people at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The word &apos;human rights does not happen again,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or were in court. </seg>

<seg id="1992"> He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now is the word &apos;human rights, not even in the new constitution,&quot; he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi power to extend all three powers in the state had resigned the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of having to strengthen civil society, you have the president,&quot; de facto suspended Saeda complained. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> But without civil society organisations could be a democracy does not work. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which sees the ideological direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> It could be revenge. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protestor in Tahrir warns: &quot;your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Norway&apos;s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe but all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the country&apos;s success might have something to do with the local appetite rather nasty smelling fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a selection of cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> And they leave a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> So you have to imagine the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of Norway&apos;s great delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply does not want to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, depending on how you would like to have his fish stink - up to one year in water. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians flock to a very hard here in Fagernes, that is, well, complete with specialty. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw and provides it with an aquavit,&quot; Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but also as a so-called &quot;rakfisk General,&quot; says the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> People eat small fish cubes and make a large amounts of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Mansche people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk,&quot; says Harvard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The liquor can crowd out the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I cost some hors d&apos;oeuvres. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If one is to bring the rakfisk near the nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which has a long bus ride behind. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and soaked fish in autumn in airtight salt water casks. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was still not too long ago, much richer than Norway, immigrants flows. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway often failed in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here are still hates it, to name Anders Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 last year, men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it only applies to the &quot;incident on 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians are hard to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> It is held responsible for today&apos;s wealth in Norway since the early 1970&apos;s growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, which distributes round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are a people - as they say - need to be careful. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Your English is exactly like that of most of the people here. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As with all money raised in the years up to the global economic crisis, which they had not, Norway, held its purse firmly closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go in winter, skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And, of course, rakfisk eating,&quot; she adds with hearted laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow and instead of me for another court - from rakfisk I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Such a moose burgers is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes wonderful to me. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But on the evening of the stink fish on the menu is once again. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests at the vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live TV circuit to one, with fly dressed show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What have ye up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here are our points, Harvard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> They applauded and laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> But perhaps it is, but the severity of the whole fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to his office, he wants to grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring built from steel, blocking off several major transport routes in the capital and on the roads for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, it was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters trying to reach Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is committed to reduce the violence,&quot; Pena Nieto said earlier this week the U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, which we will be able to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was working as governor of his home state Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered, for example, would like to him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents of the resort to write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can ride on one of the highways, Pena Nieto, who represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets that were once again. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect real and lasting changes&quot; to him, his friend and political ally Gabriel LAX Nietos Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, as regards the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years out of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be greater on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under highway on guided tours and represents, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems are in the municipality of urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> At the beginning of this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a wasteland in the vicinity of a large landfill sites the corpses of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of governor Pena Nieto Mexico have been murdered in the state of more than 1,000 women - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure, to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But, in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete building, typical for the run-down district, fights Irinea Buendia with the tears when they showed me photos of their deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at their home, it seemed as if her body had been washed,&quot; Senora Buendia remembers. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body had already used. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross, which bears a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family, you have denied her until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me when I was a humbug, troublemakers, whingers. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> You just want that we accept their verdict and the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto Präsidentenbinde on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to care during his tenure to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that, as president, he is so, as he was as a governor,&quot; says the PRI Congressman LAX in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But it is precisely be afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The public prosecutor&apos;s office claims: Bradley Manning was not complaining about mistreatment </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The public prosecutor&apos;s office is contrary to Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The hearing dealt with Mannings time in the military prison in Theodore Roosevelt, Virginia </seg>

<seg id="2104"> One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defense to the rejection of the charges - manning had been punished by the harsh prison time already had enough - manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen during his term of service in Iraq thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed manning as a source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday, with Manning went through the forms, which had filled officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Militärgefängnis, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011, increased detention conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials were manning questions and his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When interviewed him on Friday to the forms, manning admitted that he assessed the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by setting up a total of as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had consulted manning directly to his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns to express orally, and officials have discussed this with him, and to deal with them. They were not, however, be logged. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (concerns),&quot; &quot;no problems, and that is not necessarily meant that I said nothing,&quot; manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning, asked why he has not complained about his treatment, when he met with a committee in January 2011, which should investigate the mentioned to him a few months earlier on a form suicide thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> During this meeting, Manning replied that his intention to downgrade consisted to allow its observation status of &quot;prevention of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said it did this restrictive status - which is assigned to a level below the suicide risk - to his and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to convince employees that it was good to me, and the observation status on the prevention of injury get rid of (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months, before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and was due to the heat even unconscious. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not to be aware of what is happening with him, or in the outside world, was burden. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, manning on this cage,&quot; he said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was moved to Theodore Roosevelt, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without any society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to remain in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep, or even just to establish. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He was always have to sleep with light, which from the outside in his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> When he turned up at night, and his face no longer guards were able to see him, so he turns back again. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011 Mannings Mannings lawyer formally objecting to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge also asked Manning to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Theodore Roosevelt and are counting on a morning naked before guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> During this census Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover themselves with its ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> In the survey on Friday manning that he had concluded from a command of his guard, that he should leave the ceiling, with which he could cover, he admitted, however, that no one had asked him. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning had testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked in the previous night, he would have been tried before, to show an official that he poses no danger to themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning told the officials, he would have been able to use the federal his underwear or his flip-flops, in order to injure themselves, but has not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, so manning said his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge will consider reducing his prison experiences and at least be drastically, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has indicated that Manning will commit less crime, while others will be contested charges, which are considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. From the public prosecutor&apos;s office is expected to be a justification of the detention conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules that apply to all under the highest safety precautions in Theodore Roosevelt under prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include the benefits of the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> He is found guilty on all counts, threatened him a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people were forced to leave due to the lack of opportunities, Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - call them hard times in the memory, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette is of the opinion that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as the helplessness in me. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs point to two queues: one for &quot;&quot; (&quot;Mexican&quot;), another for &quot;extranjeros&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my life has been referred to as &quot;Mexican.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic shortcuts - exactly what my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;my friends in New York,&quot; an Italian name. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I decided for &quot;Mexican-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather&apos;s, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to say to me in this language at both ends of the interviews. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent I will also not meaningless. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about those Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto moment this week, when the future visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as most likely to remain in Mexico, rather than in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc modelled in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Mexico&apos;s Pena Nieto vowed to continue to wage the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848, fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event should not be overlooked. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> As soon as a US government official criticism of Mexico, you can hear - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children Montezumas go on the warpath. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about feelings of resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people Mexican origin living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, lies in the fact that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents emigrated part - got no chance in Mexico and in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And, in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may now living the American dream, have visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, which we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes blurred, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This clearly applies to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a memorial, a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families would not have failed in Mexico, they would not have gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would see us now is not behind the silk curtain caught - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who you are - and Mexican Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While it is in American citizen, she sees itself as a part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> How should I learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to take their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Mexican Americans want to set up a provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues, such as a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injured feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, given the unequal income distribution, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid, because you need alone, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some of the Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> It can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem to be such a hope to nip in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual blame were countless buildings to rubble and ash, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time, rockets are taken from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although both Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - both Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war, which will neither lost nor gained </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, seems to be optimistic in the face of the current situation anything other than appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November persists, the this week&apos;s struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Since 2007, the leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group saw large losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that you have the time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to take powerful and rich friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as has taken for Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren could face the Stürzung Bashar&apos;s, up to Jordan, where hamas- allies are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Brotherhood is verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on People&apos;s views. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, which can not be wooed by Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, leave the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Hamas is no longer a military threat. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli anti-missile system, &quot;Iron Dome&quot; has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israel will be able to sleep, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States hold firm on its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remain, not least thanks to the closed plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state to protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, however, continue to be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is well in the run-up to the election on 22 January his Likud party has allied itself with Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> This is why cuddled scheming Palestinians and leave them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> In fact, if you have control over the West Bank, then they would not like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip to fire rockets? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them in check and punish those behind the wall, you should dare to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry, but the Arab Spring could make you a line through the bill. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries on the seat of power, have little left for Israel, you will first focus on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is greater than that of his four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments in the repair of its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Indeed, that is the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Even Israelis should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world, taking tentative steps in the direction of democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt someday explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions to the suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demand over the years, its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a nudge from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The right answer is, those who will be represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and from this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The small - for the near future, the hope is that the cease-fire outsiders grants more influence on the enforcement of this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by trade and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would be done more than for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for a UN observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama, too, must play its part to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he missed the presentation of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems as if it were a reluctant participation. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws for single entry into force cigarette packaging </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This brand logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are also printed with dramatic images, which show sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick babies and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the different health warnings and images onward Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in small letters. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> Australia will introduce the world&apos;s strictest regulations on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking, the glamorous image of tobacco will be eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> This is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% under likely will start no longer afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see children young age, that they are trying to understand the message to promote the tobacco companies with their brand image,&quot; federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, the changes will impact, other countries are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby hard fought against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> So it was with the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra hectares of Zico, import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone cap has risen to cover the unbearable packaging, since the British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale shops and waiting for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, is located in the popularity of social media in precisely the population group, to which the plan is directed. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, it is prohibited to act as a sport no longer sponsors and forced most of the traders to put cigarettes in shops. The tobacco advertising is switched on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Anyone who sells tobacco, and only a small area to promote its products, is not around to the Internet,&quot; says Becky Freeman, researchers in the public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noticed an increase in reports of experience to brands, which have been written by &quot;ordinary people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question must be asked: is this just a private person, which is so great favours at Marlboro cigarettes, that it takes a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry, rather than focusing on marketing, dealing with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> She has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, though none of the countries has increased trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001, which wrote photographic warnings. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are under consideration in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers defiantly show. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images will not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;It is simply a dump, and the box,&quot; says Victor el Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, &quot;King of the pack&quot; in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging have complicated stacking shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;In the past, I have to sort needs an hour to a delivery, now I need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government would have to ban cigarettes - then we would have said OK, that&apos;s it, we make,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly elektrisierten world it is nice to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait on another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> To wait for a half day at the airport on a flight, it is quite - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> When it comes to you, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting idea, which may promote the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on one or the other screen staring us no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In other words, we should welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of &quot;boredom: a Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) does not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom has a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls adorned a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that want to exercise than the experience, &quot;a satisfactory activity, but it will not be able to define themselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom differs from apathy to the effect that the person is not working, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> When the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience of boredom, he says, is a &quot;disruption of the process of attention, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can listen to almost as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be seen in the context of bored people, the problem in their area, or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that it is boring to us, even if we are just struggling to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;The unengaged Mind: defining boredom in terms of Attention&quot;: &quot;the idle minds: the definition of boredom under the aspect of attention,&quot; which was published in September in the journal &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science,&quot; Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants heard a tape, on which a person read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard a loud television program from the adjacent space that has nothing to do with the content of others had heard it on low volume, so that it was almost imperceptible, while the third group to hear these sounds not at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who heard the barely audible television, to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they have had problems to focus, and could find no reason for this to their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, if you put a monotonous activity - &quot;as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor, music can distract and help to feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particular film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people get bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a &quot;scale of boredom vulnerability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale statements such as &quot;a lot of things that I have to do, and repeated are monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests, that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - in particular, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human development and gemeinwesen conducted at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do homework, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen in terms of boredom or declined. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, he was sure that &quot;the youth will be perceived as a particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily lives. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: boredom is healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drugs to relieve them - that have shown studies. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, which explored the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom, the brain would like to say that we should do something different,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what you should just do best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If there is a boring and one of these energy used to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can provide short-term for heaven, but in the long term they evaporate again. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So who his bored children an iPad, it is enough to distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;self-control of a situation on the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas will receive more self-control. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also see them not to be critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to feel us away from the constant activity and Technologieberieselung well. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds as if we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people in truth only after a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly being stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, even if the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before the court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked them. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police found marijuana in the car, had been summoned for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a fine of $100 - and received a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> To legalize marijuana in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offences less by the law, rather than from the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of Administrative Offences, which revolve around marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, has already approved similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession of small dimensions. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that pursuing existing marijuana offences and people are still quoting in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so quickly that I don&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J., the police chief in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington scratching perplexed at the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline on 1 December 2013 before our eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington there is of the opinion that Colorado is, in any case, most of the states with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes, and then to the own consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, the state therefore well suited to the orientation,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith also admits that there is no place or system can do more to serve as, in the sense of a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, which we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, known as I-502 enters into force on 6 December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system is not yet exist, but legalized the possession. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practice issues need to be resolved at this time - for example, as the government target of a &quot;reasonable access&quot; to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the ban on the use of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal, &quot;a recently formed research group says. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November chief sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years ago, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; will strive for any prosecutions for these offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorados district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he gave his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams of marijuana or less accountable in court, even though many have been indicted for other offences. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our authority has the duty to pursue violations, where they were at the time for crimes,&quot; Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided to do so, not all outstanding procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I don&apos;t waste my time to implement the law until it changes,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> District prosecutors if it is a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants in court for marijuana offences and local acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for criminal that you can still do not accept the legalization,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states, such as alcohol, the smaller quantities of marijuana, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also waiting nervously on the instructions of the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik adviser to the Obama administration is of the view that investigators are likely to enter any doors, to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, state-regulated marijuana shops. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado don&apos;t wait for the fact that the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the election day some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, even though they could open up until about a year ago. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level, a major problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this legislative change. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Then we decided, for what the community and not afterwards, for which the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many questions open. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Today, not only university students to be attacked for their views </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once held for the world&apos;s largest stamp, for a modern Greek symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said, I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with the fact that students in neighbouring rooms had sex. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A N Wilson said Haydn, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> One had harassed me only for one reason - a reason, which seemed in this so-called cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatchers and I advocate in the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, according to the latest reports is suffering from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organized and rising hatred on the Tory students in Oxford has gained such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection, who is gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they are often due to their political views, &quot;active in isolation, attacked personally and declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They are calling for ensuring a place in the Equality Committee of the college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,&quot; the Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis represented. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It shows an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce was, among other things, and with silver suit and silver occupied floor protzte. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Conservative students at other universities say they are regarded as &quot;scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham said in a Sunday newspaper: &quot;there is a growing trend at universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon club without having to have met us at all. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> In Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent, who initiated the request for greater protection is of the opinion that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable.&quot; The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that they have observed in JCR members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> When I was incredibly shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education, not an honorary title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would be even Stalinisten on terror. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the current week, the new students learn more about themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even with the joys attended it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues, such as the miners&apos; strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century English. On what should happen, I was not been taken. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;, Miss Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased),&quot; please translate the first paragraph. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I stumbled. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are simply stupid?,&quot; he asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students kicherten. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears in my eyes on wallten. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that you do in your free time, a couple of hours - in other words, if they are not too concerned with their social activities are,&quot; Pitt gave vent to me. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned with hängendem head in my room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> On this evening, I sat in the college alone at dinner, when someone typed me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is what it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected to be Tory harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore, it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the Tory pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I tried to adjust to me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This should prove to be unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A study in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, as a conservative force Eton College had visited, said to me: &quot;you are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;As Tories have sex?&quot; One asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> Each other? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so, such as homosexuals in front of the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt like. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be able to meet like-minded after collapse of darkness? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> I should have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that were in front of me, extended before my mind to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, which was open to identify themselves as Tory, Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had discussed Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and to write speeches for you. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place, found him provincial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic-fascist history perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he took a professorship at the BMP Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he said to me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to commuting between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the forties were accepted all the political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> You would never do such a thing, not in my city of the tower. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends always impeccable manners on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes marred. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Give me a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that you can only neckt. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart if you. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and Renounce his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another Geschichtstutor claims seriously, I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I zerging secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a &quot;brainwashing,&quot; and called them &quot;old sucker.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father, who suggested the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid myself in my room, and my Häscher gave up after five minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me a weinerlichen tail. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And even worse is that it was a University of Oxford, which spawned not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is far behind a reputation of equality and freedom of thought hidden. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance of the celebrity &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> On the occasion of the exhibition &quot;Valentino - master of couture,&quot; which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemachers. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four million to the winner of the Indonesian volcano your life and your health at risk if you have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people, for their work is hell, and other work word for word in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He must rise every day, down to the bottom of the crater, where the gas out of the ground advance sulphur entrenched in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After he has extracted large stones, which can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Although there are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the need for more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they need to keep the balance and put their cautious steps, so that they are not slipping and crash. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> You know that each step can cost lives, as a French tourist, who crashed a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miner from Kawah Ijen 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they dismantle. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> The path between the tourists who shoot like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales that a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 metres </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The company is PT Ngrimbi, which uses since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and never (better) said its workers, which pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and used in the manufacture of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;Because we are usually 70 kg, we will receive for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million),&quot; Anto, which normally three routes a day explained to us. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> For each route he needs three hours that he is completely done, but at the end of the day, he then 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What looks like a lousy pay for such an inhuman effort, but it is the triple of what he would earn with the field work. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The daily wage of the miner here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) will be paid at the coffee harvest a day, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 million) is very high,&quot; said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer explained on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27-year-old Anto since three years of his life at the Kawah Ijen to play, whose sulphur when he left the first tracks, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work here two years ago, because I would like to invite you to make or to learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in a more than decent English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This friendly and intelligent, but could work as a tourist guide of the life gestrafte young man, waiters or at the reception of the hotel, but instead he performed the work of a Tragesels. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands at two o&apos;clock every morning, because the sulphur coming out at night, where its characteristic yellow shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadow challenging, he rises in the light of a small headlamps on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, in the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 on Kraterboden baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite their large profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized, in order to save costs, and the media, the work on their own account and will be paid according to weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> You also get no share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) charge per camera, which the guardians of this nature parks demand, together with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) from the tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and human donkeys. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals, and not for the people,&quot; Madrusin, an alert, 42-year-old carrier, which operates three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen protested. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is in a position to contribute up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, &quot;as long as there is&quot; because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulfur burns the eyes, throat and itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers in the thick pillars sticking up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... Of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, Arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders of the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years used to be able to contribute 50 kg. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which will be transported by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life,&quot; explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in the absence of some teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The oldest of his five children with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur-makers. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the meagreness generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore babies needed to rescue the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Stamford put the blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, thou art my patriotic duty wife: we meet our citizens, and we are creating life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising Minzbonbons, but - or precisely for that reason - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as &quot;will be a&quot; Bao &quot;(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company BBH, who has shot the video preserves the hope that the commercial funny manner, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to perform their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the Internet, which is why we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, and that is why we realized that this is an issue that we had to look into the matter. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirting with Pheromonen or the organization of speed dating evenings (quickly). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Therefore, we thought: why don&apos;t we do something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, for example, how to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year, there are 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything so far had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich, high-technology city-state in south-east Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why not get the Stamford more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was partly due to a &quot;better training&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities have contributed to the higher number of alone, and the delay marriage and birth rate, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to tackle on a surge in immigration in order to reduce the population to resentment in the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are critical to ensure that they do not keep wages low and integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in the number of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on the economy of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore has also shown unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are not built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> She also has an impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the &quot;shoe boxes&quot; and must be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large apartment for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> However, Lim yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; to sell much faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This means that you are much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He admits, however, that the new standards wanted to give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units within a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is to take the talks with the Singapurern, the work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are highly stressed that housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The children can get others. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;For me, it is important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another, about 20-year-old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women have their careers, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons that you can have no children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> That is why the Stamford have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The offline offline private is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary, we are dealing with the private property, or &quot;areas of private life, where one has the right to protection against any kind of interference.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for someone under 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> As this definition will be applied to his everyday life and the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> He understands the dangers to which he is, if he is well-known in the Internet situations, which he would not share in real life? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years ago, which are often in the Net. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases they tied the concept with &quot;something very private,&quot; on a personal level, and &quot;on the password and user&quot; if you apply it to the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office,&quot; says the 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of &quot;private&quot; in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very confidential secrets, my mother may not know it, but not the whole world,&quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> FB I upload pictures or pictures of the game. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I am also distributes my time with well-known. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I would be part of a photo that is not of me, or from someone who makes the stupid,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy is well aware that it is wrong to write, publish obscene photos of naked, of crimes, or abusive or violent comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most are related. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I am reported on Twitter, to put myself and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know whether someone answers, I invite you,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives or friends in the distance,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He replies that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Even if someone foreign empfähle, he would ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ASK ASK, he admits, 20 of the people not to know that he has attached his friend list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It frightens me, not because we have something in common, for example, music,&quot; he indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> After giving the boy has made him no allusions or asked him after his address or telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If somebody harassed me or they demanded of me, I simply remove him from my account,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José reported, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boys are not unknown experience, which is known today as a cyber-bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The well-known girlfriend was blackmailed into a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He has never know who it was,&quot; he assured. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> According to José the victim has not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He has only made it private.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He then outlined a series of steps to configure a user account. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> In contrast to Jorge this boy would upload photos of well-known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, that is what I would do if I dislike him or he is one thing I want to wipe out. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this is cyber-bullying,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> For example, Marielos Porras, teachers in English with a university degree in education and learning believes that are understood to be the children and young people, that it is the purpose of social networks, to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet as a medium for the search for information; however, with the release of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of &quot;digital natives and immigrants,&quot; these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are the children and young people who grew up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants, which is supposed to teach them, where we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He explains that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria, which must be distributed, published or said, and that in an age where the maturity is not sufficient.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be picky about who, if it is to think the most important thing to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is to provide you with questions, which brings you to reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To say to you, you should not do it, do not work,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras then called a number of possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why do you find it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or: would you, if you published a photo of you, such as that which thou hast published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know what the other post about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> If you have other people asked for permission in advance, if thou hast labelled photos of celebrations? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: all need to know what you&apos;re doing at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> There are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that the parents read carefully the directives of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If you understand all the sections, you have a solid foundations, in order to talk with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;Old age, for example, or what one part or publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the children need to be reminded of the lesson, &quot;Thou shalt not speak with strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Conclusion of the summit of Unasur without the publication of the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit of the presidents of UNASUR ended today in Peru, in theory, without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and signed by the seven leaders should be present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> San FRANCISCO repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government leaders of the Unasur. Sources in the Heads of State and President firm initially told that they would be handed over to it after the examination, said, however, that it would be published for some time on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> If you have any questions about the text, you said that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was set out in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists&apos; access to information about the summit was limited at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, the image of the president meeting without sound with the message &quot;private meeting, limited audio,&quot; was in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few details that among journalists have been received by the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document, which was widespread during the day, the list of participating presidents, eliciting the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media unease, which was called for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> After that, the media, the president of Peru, sent an e-mail with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala and not the official document to the conclusion of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In October Peru was host of the Third Summit South America - Arab states (Aspa), and also on this occasion was despite emphatic invitation by the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had been announced in advance, nor published. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the Aspa can convince themselves that the document was published on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Two international meetings on the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for the journalists would be available, but in a highly restricted access to the information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, a ruling of the European Court of Justice in The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which is beginning to hear Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima launched against Santiago, the pleas of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will follow the verdict on the differences that we are currently before the International Court of Justice, and run,&quot; said Humala, along with his Chilean. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that abides by the international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and the international courts subjects,&quot; Piñera adds and largest Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ, after Colombia raised after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it had deemed a serious mistake, legal action against the agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to submit to the International Court of Justice judgments. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Present at the summit, the president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In 2011, Paraguay, which has been ruled out after the removal of its president Fernando Lugo of the Unasur participated in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit in Lima shortly after lunch time. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The head of state was reading out the final document, which said that 16 decisions have been taken and set out the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;take significant steps in the direction of the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that measures would be taken to improve &quot;the cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and against organised, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant trains, but intended to expand our production capacity and to show our people a better future,&quot; Humala added. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 flagship projects, which is intended to improve the spatial connections in South America, and particularly in rural and border areas... And thus combine our countries and open up new forms of economy,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, who were on the horizontal axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption&quot; of the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for that Latin America continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace, and with good neighbourly relations remains, was another aspect, which was highlighted at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meetings, that he was in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his vis-à-vis of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to deal with the maritime conflict after one of Bogota in question ruling of the ICJ respectfully. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I will be meeting tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua to make necessary talks with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega, that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible,&quot; Santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, the defense ministers of the block to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened in terms of the defence of the region also met in the run-up. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even if the latter is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the presidents of UNASUR, which took place in Peru in Lima said on state television that the Europeans&apos; in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing &quot;and&quot; are now virtually a fatherland. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which push the Member States of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there are still reactionary sectors that strive for a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the agreement of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who never commit to something, and in return, we sign the South Americans everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights headquartered in Washington and will be financed by the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa asserted that he did not regret this decision, because it does not betray his principles, but also fulfilled his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it was &quot;justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not complied with procedures.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to subject him an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sex, while &quot;the Swedish law, which allows via a video conference on the Embassy of Ecuador in London could be carried out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Since it is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,&quot; said the leader in Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> However, there is the danger that he treated physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space, and no physical exercises in the open air could carry out. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That would affect the health of every human being,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, the granting of a letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that it would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities Europe&apos;s, he stressed that there have been talks with London, I have to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, this word, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures at various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> This morning, &quot;when Britain granted carte blanche, this is done, in my opinion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden verhörte Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or via Skype, as it was to be the Swedish law and made in other cases, the problem was resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, &quot;the mediocrity, the malicious intent and the lie that weaken the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the most evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who aspire to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is not more of these journalists, &quot;and also not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewers bourgeois&quot; countries, and it is anticipated that he will deepen in a re-election, &quot;the revolution, and pursue the path in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported maintaining the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain &quot;hard and instead give any opportunism and no legal coup d&apos;etat,&quot; because the legitimacy of democracy has been &quot;destroyed in Paraguay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the privileged maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime borders between the two countries to negotiate, for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> This judgment is not implemented at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South and Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They need to be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome them and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America, to call international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In terms of the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in order, he stated that he sees this possibility, &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if he would lose the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had to believe that I was guaranteed that likely victory, which is why I must comply with this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, then I would like to withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is crucial,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba once again after the election campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;In any case, it means a relapse into the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader took part in Lima today on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, which ended with a call for greater regional integration, to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Cause of a dying of AIDS is now a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when they were the result of the investigation confirmed: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb,&quot; he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success, &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in front of his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, a few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At that time it avoided even the director of a clinic of IMSS, to adopt, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, many people are still in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and the immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, i.e. the emergence of the first reported cases, &quot;the great success today means that the survival of patients, which absorbs the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; the head of the HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, but he said that this information was based in April of this year from a respected scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those would have greater opportunities, which are not drug addiction: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above mean that anyone who gets in the age of 25 years ago, the diagnosis HIV-positive, in this sense, &quot;can easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control,&quot; the expert said. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate has reduced significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who are dying of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died since the release of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is a universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - so why people are still dying out? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they do not know their condition, i.e., in the very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a compelling statement: &quot;nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all the people, where it is needed, need to be offered screening tests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de si del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who had to carry out its test at a private laboratory, and this is the only reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS phase, and even the Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I have to die, then three more times,&quot; says one in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve the, well, I am ernähre practise sport and take the medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work a lot, but I have an active, responsible sex life, I am on my health and the other person,&quot; Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, to encourage those who with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS Day afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> You should make the test, if they belong to the risk group, the sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how you can live like all the people responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the cause of HIV said. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In certain places, &quot;the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past, they were made separately, now you give us with hundreds of packages, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The risk of new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need?&quot; Is a question of widespread derision by social workers, guidance personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, who did not want to expose young people, the correspondent said. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality looks; it is best, the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data from Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen nationally on 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in terms of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2%. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there is a case for every registered 4 or 5 persons who do not know it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling, which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the group, which has been achieved over a bankrupt trade in Mexico, a pernicious precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country will be created, the payment problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> One could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the recognition of the judgment on 15 June handed down by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale leads for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> While the judges of the matter indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans first says that it is the main proceedings in Mexico to the trade deals with bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedures in the case of default of companies is not known with länderübergreifendem profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Indeed, for this purpose, the model law was created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, but the American Law Institute has been used as a mediator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling states that it is not the majority required for the restructuring of the debt would be without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation, which had branches of vitro with its parent company, has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Indeed, it is not the first case in which this scheme was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and comercial, whose liabilities have been confirmed, the group companies from the Instituto Federal de (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies). </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that after deducting the votes of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had no majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This will not be taken into consideration by the court of appeal. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Héctor &quot;Hetin,&quot; Reyes: &quot;basketball was my life &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globalization of the sport, Héctor &quot;Hetin,&quot; Reyes, the basket was more than 60 years and has traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of the history of the city of the country such as Héctor &quot;Hetin,&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years, part of this sport, either as a player lower classes, the first National League player, agent and manager in the BSN with the vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;My life I have put myself in the basketball many hats, even more at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s,&quot; he remembered Reyes during a visit from Primera Hora Bayamón at home, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Almost all the walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In the heart of Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotionalsten memories are those who remember his time at the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated his fifteenth anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or director of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;That was my best years that I have enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships of the vaqueros since 1967, as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Then took &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good manager, &quot;Reyes says. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I do know that genes Bartow, who worked as a trainer here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was given to me, said: &quot;I have a very strong and 2 m big players. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had ever Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Raymond Gausse Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists, and one of our best shooter. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I know, even as he said that, if Mincy allows for a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time he preferred it to enjoy its executions and Mincy&apos;s in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> After the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been, if not repeat this Canadian referee would have left us in the last game for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This group of the World Cup in 1990 was the best national team that you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the US offered a fight against us, as when they won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote&quot; Morales, who could not be here in 1990 due to a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, with which we won a gold medal and caused us great joy, was that of the upcoming tournament in 1995), Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of what happened at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues, in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult issue. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a number of good coach Julio Toro, Flor, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the young, the work of Leo Arill strikes me well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995, which encompassed the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What remains to be done to you? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The fact that the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in your area, and only in the national teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children needlessly make many trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, contracts officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I would like to listen to music, see YouTube videos of music in my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and to go to a basketball game. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The advertising slogan &quot;who shot at J.R.?&quot; The expectation should be created for an episode of emotion, where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses. </seg>

<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what should be on the tombstone of J.R.,&quot; said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
