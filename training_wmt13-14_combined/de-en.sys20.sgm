<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada, the United States for the conduct of the elections in the individual States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010 in importance where 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States could be recorded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that the voters a photo identification and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws also periods for the early vote, the right declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, a state of the electorate requires a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to this practice should be extended to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 States draft legislation with which the voters will have a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters people not by a government authority of their state issued photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012, does not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay for the required ID. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This is further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students who are regarded as voters their voice more for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several States, from its establishment issued photo identification to use. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, members of the same States allow Angel- or hunting clubs that are more on the Republican side to choose which of these associations issued cards for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state that such a request. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen States have passed legislation that voters are demanding that their US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic votes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators in eight States laws in 2011, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to offer help to those voters who would like to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, the Republican legislators in five other States adopted laws aimed at the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, were in the general elections in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same is true for the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of people who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been affected by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted laws that require photo identification showing. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the crucial States for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes, the electoral college are needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: if the test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the PSA-Test sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to a greater reluctance of already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have the opinion of two doctors. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that a observation after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was conducted. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, who has been ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men African American origin, there is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers, the aggressive and others, where the Indo-European. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patients, the extent of the risk of cancer is made clear by the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate Tata crab, if it is the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, where cancer has recognised, no treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> It certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The most important thing is, however, to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for Urology as Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible that the pros and cons of the widespread PSA testing. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only available in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> The disease prevention </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and move. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there is no smoking, it would be at least a 50% increase,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> You seem to be the risk of breast, fierce appendix, fattening appendix, Speiseröhren, Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against fierce colorectal cancer,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In great quantities, it increases the risk of wrath or fattening of developing colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by smoking, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage the body cells and the development of cancer,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins. </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists, the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their investigations, however, is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to talk about the long-term degradation. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs particle boson analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, has a certain sensation, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It does, in fact, that this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved in the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And, finally, is the last particle whose existence from the standard model, our best or least wrong explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but still not empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model boson strong. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week on a major physics conference in Kyoto were presented, but there are still no data, to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There are in this world will inevitably be inescapable law, which means that two objects not in the same place at the same time, there can be. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to go against this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they, too, such a law, &quot;the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles do not have the same space occupied at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;, the &quot;state&quot; by and large, from some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the particle physicists share in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and suddenly the rotational poles. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other move all, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These all are made according to the website The delta Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Greek barys, meaning &quot;we will not deal with the &quot;power particles,&quot; by which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs particle boson somehow would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be emphasised, however, that not all of these all such exotic creatures, such as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this history, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Q-switching or the &quot;light particles,&quot; the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When a particle with an electrical charge is accelerating or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place &quot;disrupted&quot;, such as a pebble in a pond was thrown. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the all &quot;winner of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true for the Higgs particle boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs particle field, &quot;disrupted&quot; must be to ensure that this Boson shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs particle field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has very high energy, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks could be addition. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is a huge particle accelerator as CERN needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km - in order to achieve this kind of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs particle field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the Q-switching) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For what can all these research now &quot;good&quot; asked Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and predictions of SM to investigate. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and open some holes of the model could fill. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which account for around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (retabling ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, the CERN such deviations until now not been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Effects of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories was not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the film itself, the first permanent TBarCode laser (were the first continuous) has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a &quot;laboratory she&quot; has been seen. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine.... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications from all the instruments, the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, has, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work on a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the &quot;eye&quot; and gave him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir published </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;death with dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this important area is still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Devoir published has tried to look at this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the panoramic monté. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;You gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years,&quot; he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a vast weakness prevents him, only to go to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The table in front of a tasty lunch sitting, he resigned itself to help with the meal. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave it even to smile and to talk with strangers, which employs around him, his medication, and a bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating,&quot; he agrees. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt,&quot; says Pierre three Victor-Gadbois psychologist in the home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In the childhood phase is for some people to return to an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot;, a step backwards, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois instructed, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> You have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, they are the doctors and nurses who care for them, no longer with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care fare. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, &quot;deliberately and suffocation&quot; to die. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease, I have really got to know my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wishes more in life,&quot; she says, before they accepted that it is a mask, which helps her to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> You expected in the next few days, a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care will be used, if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> The death more enjoyable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, state residents on a bed for the palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, if you consider that one day we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This is life in the best possible conditions continue, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the homes. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It grants the dying, according to request an oral care with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics must have their blood sugar levels no longer control. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, we have Mr X a beer, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son the beer glasses at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help families and patients alike,&quot; says nursing director Nathalie Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the others. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man from 93 years ago, the last family Rally in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow while in opening up a young man dies from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and two small children surrounded, tragically, he has tried everything in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years proves,&quot; Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And a number of organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> These very serious shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec&apos;s ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors of the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of palliative care as Dr States Waulo and Dr. Bernard lapo mãos signed to their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec&apos;s the health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all of the right to a high-quality palliative care before they accepted on euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without the mitigating measures taken. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions stubbornly until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has broken as a result of chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my Onkologin, that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I have given up the fight, told them. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was at the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No OmniStrip strong care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nurses, that it will not, after their pain by a team of palliative care have been eased. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be clearly stated that the palliative care in the treatment of pain is not OmniStrip potent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After an Monereau, director of the palliative care of society, the home of the Greater Montreal palliative care about 8% of patients not on a pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors are so often on the back of sedation, which amounts to the patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we have this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to this of sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain is not alleviate, all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, &quot;I want you to euthanise&quot;, but &quot;I want my pain will be eased.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism went Canadian health research institutes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals large scale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road-building £30,000, companies of Bauhauptgewerbe, fundraisers, political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day, as they have a great &quot;system&quot; in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are enmeshed. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot;, for the taxpayer Quebec&apos;s was very expensive, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange how the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures,&quot; witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, Sjöstedt in Quebec and a former head of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal has given him a thorough investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road day.TV uncovered in Quebec, the former prime minister had only reluctantly agreed. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau-Bericht&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,&quot; he says, &quot;the Ministry of Transport had a billion dollars to save the treaties,&quot; because some zügelten her instinct, in order to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The charbonneau commission &quot;has already had two mayors to&quot;, he added, in the hope that it can &quot;to identify the individuals behind the tactics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Launched a 2011, the permanent anti-corruption </seg>

<seg id="251"> In this season, you have to match a new scale. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the match. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also given a lot to me. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements spur me on a daily basis, to improve my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game, it is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything is very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I must stop not in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of inf directory Clairefontaine features an up to my playing time in Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You have the advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> You also know that every training session is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player like me who have to stand up and give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Carlo Ancelotti, gives me a lot in terms of my game. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti instills all technicians respect. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with big players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injury. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of the match? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1, Lyon are the place of the finishers. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way, for the quarter finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we are against very good European teams we have something to say about it. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want to be first in our group in Porto, so that we have the return match in the event that Celtic can compete as a home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the match in the short term, a big European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already the budget for this... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for itself in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the match the resources so that this project taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it is really dear to cream off this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season, we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, you should be master with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have got what it takes to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from the match? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept that completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> If, however, we are in a home game against Troyes midfielder win, and it still is something you can accuse us of, this is certainly a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never win every weekend with midfielder. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to draw up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds up over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have shown strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the quarter finals, and also has made huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed to break with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who last season were not good, this new match &quot;geboostet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The match seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, that of a &quot;Zlatan-Abhängigkeit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Pellegrini is really powerful and many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respected the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the world&apos;s best defenders, also allows all the others to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experience? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I wanted to take part in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented some game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things there, which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I am, good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Since this was my baptism with the Bleus my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and to victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to no comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps Bleus will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> It is on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) an opening game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US strike fast food and super market, </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting somewhere behind the cashier of are </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days, there was in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Berlin, Donald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will soon be back to the air. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are led by trade unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales, which attract millions of customers, which sometimes led to receive more common. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and his mother, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which is targeted at low and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells all products of diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to the elevators, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The commodity in the Walmart branches is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Buying so many of the minor paid Walmart workers only on their own work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply, because the workers are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the protests on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month was increased. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart employees, who earned $9.5 per hour, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, show that, if the company, the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> There are approximately 1.1% more than they now pay. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart wage increases would be entirely up to the customers, each purchase will only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Per year would be for them today compared to spending of only 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine States to protests, and that the company did no losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period of Walmart sold roughly 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Walmart funds on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees work laid down and the protest only &quot;another PR stunt&quot; of the union, which organised the protests, has been. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free 1TOPSTORE!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests were this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart branches (in this progressive city of unwanted and therefore are not available yet), but McDonald&apos;s and other inexpensive restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation at $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> At fast food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s, behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s always people who complain that they live with this reward and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is in the forum of the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&apos;s in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants, a minimum wage of $15 per hour, with more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> You also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the corporate governance, the goal to stand in the way of trade union members and abzumahnen or redundant. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The most important reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discontented </seg>
<seg id="767"> Vocal protests on this day, there were also many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The height of the protests was a meeting at midday in front of the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it should sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we should all support the fast-food workers so that they receive a fair wage and economic prosperity can be achieved, every New York deserves!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the fast-food industry, in the tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately outsmart&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technologies popular subject of enlarged to become a reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, Google in the summer at its annual conference, a working model, in November was aware that Microsoft had filed a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, will be clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> You talked about the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual free land. </seg>
<seg id="778"> You, please, what research your group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, however, want the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the human race largely stuck in the period, with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes are affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want to look ahead 10 years and the radical changes this interaction predict. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without Xbox Kinect, as all for motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The submission of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, are working on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need the computer world in our physical world and make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> This, however, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We could then the real world much easier through virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And first of all, we should this silly virtual reality helmets -Proporcional! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about language control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - it is certainly not the general solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always all others about his actions and intentions to inform. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than sprawling gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not of the object, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively high, however, could in theory be reduced the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But on the whole, however, the future belongs to mixed management types, for example, gestures and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - We would like to ask, for example, you this romantic to estrelar? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say it and suggest, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Normally, I would say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - means that you want the adapts to the user, what a machine at the relevant time can afford and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that in the coming months, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working to enable the reactions of people to grasp. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The can, for example, laser sensors because they are in the depth of a good resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What claims you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1,000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the camera itself, but the quality of the Matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In this respect, all current technologies are not good enough, as the developer of the Algorithmen more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only the dissolution along the X and the yttria, but also along z axis. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of frames per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are very dynamic and, frankly, are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For my work, I was just such a device, only without touch control and more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> The number of cameras - Müsste not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect is currently working with three &quot;cameras&quot;, with one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the object deep. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could possibly solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It was not a flexible, Kinect-ähnliches system where we could play with different camera interest to see how we do in the three-dimensional identifying a position helps. </seg>
<seg id="827"> If I remember correctly, Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his glasses, not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, it is not pleasant, always a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the neatest variant would be a &quot;rotating&quot; enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal Gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses, together with others that you can work with virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - places us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual club was in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem that critics often point out this idea: there is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="834"> The answers to your group to this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often talk of the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure perfectly true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies, which are aimed at the &quot;pictures in the air&quot; to provide a robust, for example, the number of Immink 386,798 ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger, a feeling that at the moment, however, is so weak, as pustete someone on the knuckles. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> We think that it feels, what it would feel if it is just a little? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, so we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is, instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms, as well as large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain only moderately, and we still have many years of hard work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: on many issues, we are only just beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt, the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot;, the city dwellers is devoted to the avant-garde of the art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the elite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes on the borders of the city and often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, or take in the scene Musical-Instruments. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also are issued, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also a man of the city and firework through its presence on the streets of his fellow citizens in the face and a smile at them for good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he grabbed a revolving organ and became the Petersburg Dominion-occupied organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his artistic role, his philosophy and his image was finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city. </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have the color red as a fashion designer, who is with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society calls on everything differs somewhat from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But let me through my provocations with the people into the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Any of my past provocations was an invitation to the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When Did you know that you have to be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In one of the main exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work were issued. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I need to go this way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> It was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter had ended, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; hence, &quot;&quot; Pushkinskaya &quot;10&quot;, and it was only once. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It brings me to the theater, fashion, music, really everything, except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all the united in your art clinic... It was important to me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a space in the &quot;Pushkinskaya&quot; 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musically artistic club for the renaissance, the house of the Petersburg renaissance. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; visited it. </seg>
<seg id="872"> String and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight T-shirts and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin Berlin-Fiedrichshain said today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, was removed from her &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of &quot;Halli-Galli&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club &quot;Griboedov&quot; have their origin in the Art clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There, our employees and passengers. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, as a culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000 there was a poll in the press when it comes to the award &quot;personalities of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artist of the year&quot;, and that I was at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy, in new times under old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your work have a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and accuracy of the idea. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be an exhibition with the theme &quot;The Russian Museum as clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case. </seg>
<seg id="888"> All in a clown blurred and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world, we require that everyone has to complete. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now each on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and not at the heart of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not be a man&apos;s hand, but he should spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception disappears through the disguised. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we saw in the role of urban spin organ player. - A Culture should be as a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Can also commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - It must be commercial art cautious, respectful and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Previously the large groups of people: the travellers loved one thing and the ordinary people of the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are microbial communities, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred dollar note that everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you see whom thou shalt have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult star around 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - On the appearances of Michailow but that several thousand. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - To him gathereth women, in the social sphere sexuell# plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons are 300 people, and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and anything goes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have such pictures painted by a collector, even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images, which normally only at the end of their careers. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, this is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - the best cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> They say: servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real Mussourgsky it was different, because the Mussourgsky may not have seen a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could be, but they will be barred because it requires more senior experts, the former properly evaluate and pave the way for them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now only one of their own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Petersburg - What is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones can art is difficult to grow up. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> Us, these are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> In danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with killer for. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of pilgrims from Lysians with people on board are on the search for a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save the human race, the important question of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are many choices, in my opinion, is not. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Namely Mars and Venus&quot;, says the scientific staff of the Astrological Institute Vladimir Surdin Sternberg. </seg>
<seg id="940"> However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life, on the surface of Venus, a temperature of up to 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers first in terms of the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already half a century before that have been carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the bred peas differed not in the slightest by the alien species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, barrel organ quail were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without deep underground, the wild chickens. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stumpften completely. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Four days later, they died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, simply because it is impossible to work with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew holds the failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years ago in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, on the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers &quot;Bion&quot; only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilised were sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing of the space Rats offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space, we have not yet been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals from their natural habitat are torn, simply do not follow their reproductive drove. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is Abstraktem thinking and can produce a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women already fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> There was the biggest risk in Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most valuable, humanity, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> It will be after this flight can bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, no one answered this question,&quot; says space veteran Svogerslev Watschnadse tang. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female Kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also only. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 bare the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who twice in orbit and was even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> , remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We only have very few cosmonaut, where, after long flights, everything went well and healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into orbit,&quot; concludes only Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, the race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the building of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The monobenzyl laboratory in the preparation of Idaho, is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water is the feeling of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange surroundings, but infants are water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to them that life in the country, turning the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother is on the water, and that it will be easier to get water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget,&quot; says Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa Marina. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While for a newborn child the feeling of weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of weightlessness, the loss and lap muscles rapidly back and so is the ability of squeezing the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we deal with the birth at the chief tool. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The birth could, for example, take place in a special chamber, squeezing the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; Is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the Erdanziehung feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles do not. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn baby is not as an adult in the training in a contamination suit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment that we work together, which is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disability, a completely unangepassten will bring people to the world,&quot; says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space just a theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, but it will be a reality, if the people in their Lysians to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ-Chef: control of the Black system failed through no fault of politics </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, is in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly, and I think that this is not the case with us,&quot; Kala commented on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar result also appears to be a common control by Czech and German investigators. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As a negative practical example is the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas on the so-called &quot;black&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would not trouble, the system is now banned or permit? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not just the chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is to interfere in its work,&quot; says Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the supervisory committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it specifically? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> There is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is important that the European legislature to decide how to manage public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this, we have compared with each other, and although the review has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws on us, perhaps even a little &quot;strict and perfect,&quot; the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also address the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? What emerges from this project for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a joint control could help to stop us constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) is to acquire and unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that we have the system in this way only with excessive &quot;paperwork&quot;, and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What the authorities are concerned, it is the German equivalent to NKÚ the General Accounting Office, which is similar to us and also on a college, the only slightly different. Both authorities, however, are essentially similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany, however, a federal state, meaning that the courts in the individual Bundesländer - in the German system differs from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH federal funding can only control what our government funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities will be subject to the control of the national courts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the German legislation, which is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would only do so without concrete indications. Nonetheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is perhaps due to the fact that the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This is certainly not, but as I have said, such comparisons, I may not particularly like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, are also struggling with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing of cooperation with our authority, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> What the Czech legislation, what was important for your authority the revision of the procurement law, you can have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this amendment is only a short time in power, they are not yet in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our checks subsequently take place, needs to be here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We have far more impact in the preparation of future controls - so we have a new instrument of control &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes are, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of contracts have been modified. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will add another layer of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> However, there is the problem, that the rules &quot;strict&quot; and no longer can be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules, a review unterzogenen people towards the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable so that any failure to comply with the procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But then it is useful to make the law even stricter? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who abuse the system and want to attack, and not to penalise those who have committed a formal errors on the actual decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say first of all, what is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called &quot;Black system&quot; - although what exactly does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the black system now banned or permit? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not just the chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We change the law and allow the matter&quot;, but he cannot say that we act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer on the grounds of procedural errors. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets, there is some Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic is partially Schnee- and Eisglätte. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, the world is to take place? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those emergency messages to the people are so happy to pounce. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The tap tap, we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy in the world to stop or prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you realize a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide fundraiser, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which end on 21 December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which, in a time zone at 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Comes from whom this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally, from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> We would like not only collect enough positive energy in the world, but we also want, together with the public to think about the state of the world, even our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz us people also can support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The tap tap, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title &quot;world comes from&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also ring on the numerous concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, finally, provided that all is fine, and the world is not taking place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns together in a direct interconnection of Czech television broadcast live. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come to the cooperation with two? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is that we realize many events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are working hard these people involved in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has shown that the most interest in working with us, and have fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts to benefit the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we are already six years together with the club Jedlička-Institut tap in. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils of the Jedlička-Instituts are regularly maintained by teachers, help with various leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the completion of the Jedlička-Instituts is a private building, in which we do with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At each concert, several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> On what criteria you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to put together a program that all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Learn everything else on the Website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Are similar &quot;big events&quot; also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to see in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their overseas plans are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How you deal with these travel logistical and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments and other baggage PreCise mitschleppen... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nonetheless, it has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I am sometimes surprised some. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison, as in the individual countries with accessibility, how they deal with people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Moscow towards Prague is absolutely not disabled. There, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair lift, for example, in Newport. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to address the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we have to the more developed countries catch up? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things on which we are lagging behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities Selbsthilfegruppe constantly in the public sphere, go into a museum, will be able to use toilets and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, we are with the band The tap tap a little ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly Spirit strong personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: what did you do in 1998, a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I started as carers in Jedlička-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in a little hard to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am and musicians including Papa games, I, together with a colleague a Musik-AG. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Na, and, over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, say, a little out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known but only in the last few years, and I am wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped; we have also started to campaign actively for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We know that if something is on the outside, and this is not to see their own performance, in a sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the extra toothbrushes can we are good teachers, high quality equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was your goal, it with The tap tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I have felt the potential that we can deal with things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business today often copied one of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> That is on its way, logical, since anything new with caution, and only after a long time will be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities not lonely and desolate nature, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities in something, not just for themselves a step forward, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was for this success also helps you to be a tough boss, how many people listening? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, we must not compromise on many things, and also has a degree of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that this is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have tested twice a week, preparatory stages and have to spend a lot of time to spend on concert tours, then extinguished the enthusiasm among many quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> How it works but everywhere, in every band work seriously and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, The tap tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the very beginning, since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. People come and go. That cannot be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and the desire to contribute, is always welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this most megacultural Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA-Mitglied). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA-Projekten. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts with the space, but they have not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, the talk of A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneering work &quot;entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer, born in 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik&quot; by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch REP-Hirsch donated Prix. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Was already in 1925 in Poland a Eisenbahn-Draisine built for a rocket engine was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not yet clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the Draisine should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry, with rocket kommende bullets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the traditional documents is clear that the research into the stage of practical tests,. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research was then, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, appeared in the press of ing. Rohoziński, draft photo electric hunting vehicle, and the following year, the plant &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work has been completed by the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major items of space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA to join to the 1951 founded International Federation for space, and in fact, the PTA member already in the autumn of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902, 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Office he had, until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the Bledowska Desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further stage of development should already be in a position to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and the monitoring of high end. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Successor to the first missiles of the type of RM, in the years from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte Meteor-1-Rakete. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was a two-stage missile designed, its total length, 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> This rocket were three sublcasses entwickelt (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c States), which is different in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years from 1965 to 1968, the aviation institute the Meteor-2-Rakete entwickelt, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> After that, the versions and Meteor-2H Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also noteworthy for the accession of Poland to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the context of the interactive space programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second unangenehmen kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court, the law on voluntary work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> That decision provoked a lively debate in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting, the issue of a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Because of the large differences in the value of work (wages) to price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturers tried to import cheaper goods in economic competition, making the competition &quot;offers&quot; to a larger market share to usurp and to increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he has caused unemployment to rise necessarily government spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation will be exacerbated by the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling, to pay their taxes and thus the overall social, economic and social damage. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics at this point are superfluous. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, at the social level to artificially reduce their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly in changes to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to its own people to force the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages to accept. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly due to economic constraints in long-term unemployment, on the other by the erosion of workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany there has been some years, public food distribution to the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people affected is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state of their income to the subsistence needs to increase. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, even in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity of virtually all EU-Südstaaten will no doubt be on the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance on the fringes of society and about whom to hope that at some point, private investment capital flowing into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> There is, of course, the question of where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or even the employees working in Africa for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> The whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that a planned economy to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital is parochial in its position that the government will not intervene lenkend in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then we must ask whether the private capital politics and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything reprehensible, but nothing is a punishable offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department because of a lack of finances private, with the industry interdependent legal action with the drafting of legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All the violence is no longer the folk, as the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic&apos;s times and Rubicon explains: &quot;The state has long been in collapse, and the offices were filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes, illegal eighty-year-old&apos;s permitted by of benefits or with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already purchased votes to elect &quot;...&quot; people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul &quot;...&quot; You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected &quot;... Appian thought of it, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is today&apos;s society, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> From the current state of view, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies are seen as a break in the next round already. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Especially appalling is the fact that today&apos;s elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we have it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways the social level to push down the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, the participation of the state of the economy, the influence of the people on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;... that nothing from violence, or ever could emerge&quot; Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons were no wars, there would be no,&quot; says the dying Gutele tighten aper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, back in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is herself a victim; at the end of the current residents of Israel, including the self-governing regions in the current political situation, and have not even the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is that the readers to look behind the scenes, the look, whom the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go out of my own understanding of who or what group of people, the events of modern history strongly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were even their autonomous certain steps, or whether someone behind her throne, of their actions on a vorbestimmt goal drew. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomical rich families a particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the Kraken (I do not know whether anyone else about them, but I am not), the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> As might be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) - the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to link their name with criminal acts, whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not on the central banks are involved, they lead to wars or equip (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has implied). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever has tried to this family, had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused, the status of Rothschild Bank of America, the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (read: State) notes, was murdered in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Cultural Diversity Kennedy began to issue their own banknotes and wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; the Lööw Louis hospital Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite for power led the Rothschilds in 1859, 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert of spades, a Freemasons in the 33rd, and thus the highest degree of insight. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was aimed, the big royalist state sector in Europe, the second war, in particular the colonial rule of Britain are broken, and the third war is the world&apos;s population to about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would be for their amenities and its luxury and would also not so many resources) to create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the advance) and, finally, on the assumption of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top, is triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (Bestellung from Chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve to prevent crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered not repeat). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation Germany&apos;s (for the destruction of the Russian collapsed, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower &quot; Österreichisches ungarns. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In the Second World War, easier to ignite, the bankers by the policy to create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparationen documented; thus they created the impoverished masses, so that the Germans have a sufficiently strong leaders, to cheer the culprits, and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take and, at the time of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the creation of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state sought, as in the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour Declaration made the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks, there on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether some of the chain, ran to the international bankers initially had kept, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war against Germany reparationen the ground for the Second World War, was the creation of the State of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war will be similar to the Jewish people during the Second World War to the victims in the front line of combat, this time together with the Arab or Muslim people of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly people in supporters and opponents of Israel qamutiit). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where not only wrong in an endless cycle of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> There must be between the people of Israel and its leaders differ, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for the election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable, international bankers loyal humble politician, who is doing everything possible to ensure that a war with Iran, which is in the face of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly becoming a global conflict could spread, and which is due to the control of Iran on the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, to destroy the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In which light as the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In its presentation is the new world order, a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristokraten serves. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn at birth is a chip implanted in the essence of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants are all a malt to give up their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, anyone who has brains, put the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: if it&apos;s the worst that Hollywood calls </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> For their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the revolution had fled to the United States, for decades the Board on his regime had maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American government, there has been no positive outcome from this situation, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah as the confidence of their allies in other countries have been severely damaged. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in violent attempt the hostage exemption made it even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages, home to a wave of solidarity, as well as an Iranian moods. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States a partial victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the message, six embassy staff the flight. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story to Verdeckung their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports posing as members of a film Staff, who was allegedly in the country for a science fiction film. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination the genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The experts for &quot;Exfiltration&quot;, Tony Mendez, entwickelte plan also made the cooperation needed in Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic check, but at the same time, a so-called &quot;Caper Movie&quot; is the story of a successful piece of Communist, such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the 1988 documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence will be shown in other contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions, men in suits at the conference table, on the official fluren, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck is with this film a remarkable start to his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a belächelten actor is a respected director and actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third feature film after the whodunit No breeze (Her Baby Away, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, not in the home of the director of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard definition. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada &quot;played&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity, very impressive, and it still conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when somewhere the history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film unit at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much in too many places plot </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with that, the story is not many in the filmic sense exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> With the little but he has been quite successful, but the reality is sometimes a bit - which is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis in Tehran at the airport by a telephone call in America will be turned away, or even the chase on the runway, something curious). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need for a lot of action in too many places to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, but their characters would have more space, and that they are in the film is far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> It loses something Afflecks film temptingness. It is a movie, the one with some interest in the design and a thriller from the 70th years can approve reminiscent of retro style. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a date in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough. </seg>

<seg id="1377"> In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively a lower risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;The more incredible Bagaudae EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>

<seg id="1385"> The European Commission, defended on the grounds that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would hinder trade. </seg>

<seg id="1388"> The EU, citing an American study in accordance with balloons in the leading cause of death by suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious Bagaudae at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Fairly absurd is also a directive, which European officials themselves - everyone in the EU is an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>

<seg id="1393"> The EU, so that the maximum volume of food stocks, which is on the day of our membership in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or from the idea of funding for requests for aid. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage by that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will apply for a refund in the EU, &quot;said in the autumn of 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called intervention at the purchases were overcrowded. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Since the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, the EU should take heart, according to hundreds of millions of euros to pay us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far, that they are an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain organised from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Grants for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of monetary claims to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations in the member countries will easily become the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and thus also for efficiency and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A more serious problem, these experts believe that the EU grant money for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual member States. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Senator, how is it possible to get the idea for the office of the president to stand? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not about Senator or to be president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> In our country, everything would work without any problems, I would get nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age will be increased. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to become politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But if I see something, which I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I have over 40, and independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than for senator or the president to stand for election. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have done it and then straight on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> They do not return to your constituents? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that I fight for the castle after the outcome of the senatorial elections will begin. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have this clarified and said that I stand for the office of president, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function. Function is a tool with which I can realise my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> I need as much influence as possible, and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television grumbles, but anyone that wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Come to the media, a privileged kid, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me, for example, claims that journalists would be bribed or that I consultants Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You need to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left with a good proposal, rejected this deliberately, and that keeps the population only. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party and I have a much greater potential to support all the parties represented in parliament to win. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am already without thinking and party dogma of every party that can take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Watch as a man in politics rather than on the left or the right? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this is right and left but completely irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, I would like the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I am always publicly any good approach, even if these KSČM or of the ODS, and just as I am against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> They dislike you, if someone calls you as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you do not confirm this, what you just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And if you want to do. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> This can be described as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to work in the world, or they were key experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament will remain just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And that brings you in politics in the long term, not far. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, in order to enforce these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the addressee may then have to say why they oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which draws on abuses can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take only once the direct election of the president, which is a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say very clearly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the policy, I have only just begun and testing my programme for the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn&apos;t work, then I am going to six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I can not alone; that is why I have spoken with a number of well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have spoken with Radim Jančura, but rejected due to excessive workloads. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of voters are not at all to the elections, and those who are gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a Isauricus composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county main men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the creation of a party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought, because I have no time, the past each potential member of the party, and do not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You are talking about asset declarations, what would you? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I appreciate my personal wealth to about 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a home for some 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million in the bank account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I have always liked James Bond, as he was in the car, to women and, at the same time, he was fighting against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make some debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the program is not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the support for Titus I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son, not the English school fund 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So you will continue to operate as an entrepreneur, your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you go back to these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that does not depend on the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have my activities partly reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Thus, for example, my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agents. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want to see me as a Samaritan, of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must but also of something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> Monthly income on which you were used as entrepreneurs? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Around 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I would, but my endeavors. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>

<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby large operations, says: &quot;But, well, it is already the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No man is still on a voluntary basis, in one of these old-style Public License? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing needy sleeper town at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder. </seg>

<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive in. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics to be: a library needs. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of this bold (and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to contest hearing in 2003 with five books refreshs arm and a grin on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still intrigued with the axillae looked and fellow, stacks of impudent Maas his fine souvenir of the size of a pyramid and finished his three owned a well-founded speech with the words: &quot;Dear municipality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, in other words, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeken Senegalo! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euro toillette Berg causeway. </seg>

<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nominated 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is the faceless small city retorte, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, with its white façades you&apos;re inclined, a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass. </seg>

<seg id="1524"> The fully glazzing interior is bright and clear, the world enjoys floors and elegant Sanniquellie clearly speak the language of a public city square. </seg>

<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually cockroche and impersonal way,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic space configuration on the head and the reading area inside out terms. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the book Mountain is shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internetbibliothek, chess club, environmental centre and the house. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular pleasure, the black bookshelves, wall paneling, black, even if several countries. </seg>

<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural farm one day at a waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic fleece as root document. </seg>

<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, the boeken Senegalo even Spijkenisses &quot;long-overdue soul&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: to open a few weeks ago, any residents invited to a book from his personal stock. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> That is for the time being, even the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is work. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;German must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned in Berlin on a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then, Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why?. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was, after all, enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany on major international issues to take a clear position? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it is surrounded by his foreign policy and away from a policy of the United States pay, as it were, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Compounding the problem, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are so between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Expected of them, that they have a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are keys to their role, but they are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, such as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy, economic policy is driven by exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> They have economic interests to influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to upset. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect, too. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and his interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, not. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as great as they are. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you are the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about of Netanyahu ’ s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That they do precisely with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take a leading role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the leadership is still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to it, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, that every time Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti-German sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This makes it the Germans not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> There must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in European policy continues, the EU is filling the vacuum at the moment, but not who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans are simply need to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they are much less popular, c&apos;est la vie. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America, together with the challenges of the Euro-Atlantic community. </seg>

<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Conceals a China officially registered name, but nothing to do with the company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it is protected as long as the actual name employers do not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether they are right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;There will be more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Tel-Peh stalemate, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, to safeguard rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The Nachahmern rich a few additional letters, so that they can register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> It is simply Lu-Gucci from Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Also German companies are legally copied in this way, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>

<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company trademarks Zegna City Puma, an art names, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese world champion in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Stalemate hole cases but are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies from Trademarks officially gained the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call this &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, a passenger&apos;s brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> There are women who are rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of no fault </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;This is bad for business, you have to fight it,&quot; requireth Tel-Peh stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be diluted, the only treatment disappears, the image damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Stalemate Takaris reports of cases in which the court overruled Lamentations because, after the long duration of the reported name of &quot;reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because it violated its trademark in China, says Tel-Peh stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases concern also graphical elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the completing manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German concrete pump manufacturer shine Champion. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must therefore use until now an emblem, the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademarks CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment shortages. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, is one of the &quot;state of emergency in the work flow returned to normal life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, in the office are still 81.500 appeals to fulfillment. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It costs a lot to </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and meant that China is the tenth consecutive year, the list of new messages around the world, shares the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 were 1.8 billion yuan to charges have been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Simplified, this means that on average, every T7s4s 1280 yuan or 160 euros costs. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts have been closed down. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But secured the followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed to do this, as in Germany, family name could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademarks CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies while Freudenberg was right, but opponents of the process is still continuing. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Must be extremely </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The matter is now before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident that the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and will cost us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even a hundred years old files to look at, in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, the other side of Freudenberg in vain for a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; to settle. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much we value is,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Even threaten the dangers in the Far East to Europe zurückzuschwappen. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, if there are imitators vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name of Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This area of business, the company has long since been abandoned, yet he has the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We must be extremely carefully,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer stalemate Takaris rates German companies from doing business with China to be very careful. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather should the foreigners&apos; everything is somehow worth protecting, China sign &quot;as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if the last act of his trademark Freudenberg drama is governed, then we should do the opposite royalties on its own behalf, Wentzler explained. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> In the segment in question or we will be squeezed out of the market. </seg>

<seg id="1732"> Without a school, in a poor country, certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and gave him a hot meal a day. </seg>

<seg id="1736"> What are the most sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes and stored in or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> These miners and Krätze belong to the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the main stakeholders involved? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The artist Kees van Dongen estimates that at least four out of five of all reported cases of syphilis in Germany by sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> The heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, candi# estrelar (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults Grammer comparatively low, however, about 20 percent of the HIV neuinfektionen accounts for this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> After European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Grammer also come Humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the artist Kees van Dongen of Regio diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011, more than doubled. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Is the number of HIV neuinfektionen since 2007. </seg>

<seg id="1753"> This is about a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms point to a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, flow, bauchschmerzen and vesiculation or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because it can cause sexually transmitted diseases through smear infections and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore recommend experts especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Can be diagnosed early and most of the STI will be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> By sponsor, donations and, last but not least, the payments, which the chorus throughout Germany ersingen, something comes along. </seg>

<seg id="1770"> This is not a foregone conclusion, because obviously the disease across the country, saying they would prefer to be dead. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Really strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also the state sanctioned way of life, that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers, who carry the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, &quot;but the rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different - flesh to flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote the cultural exchange, the visiting imbongi choir every two or three years, together with South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence, and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent, even in times of apartheid. </seg>

<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger have found evidence that it constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet, the ice sheet. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This is at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably came from comets or asteroids may also on the Mercury are taken. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed by the citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix, in the depths of space. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time they send images to Earth: small elbow holes in endless expanses. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera, the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute have developed. </seg>

<seg id="1802"> This image of an infrared telescope shows the sharp a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are as blue items that are difficult to identify the pink &quot;babies&quot; in a circle. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This was a state-constituting region - of scientists - the 1990s unromantisch called the Spitzer telescope of Navarre was discovered at a distance of 6500 light-years. </seg>

<seg id="1808"> The plejaden cluster of galaxies, including &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot; at night can be seen with the unaided eye. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> With the telescope, however, the colors are better. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Looks like a red Age of helix# NCC-72936 in this infrared photograph the viewer. </seg>

<seg id="1814"> This baby could star in its full beauty only through the infrared detectors of sharp telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings, how this came about, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Maybe they are the remnants of a Saturn worlds, 4.5 billion years ago, disappeared without trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the biggest and strongest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the whirlpool galaxy </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the colours are pictures of spiral galaxies to true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The European Southern Haller veröffentlichte picture shows the several thousand light-years away in the constellation Trifid-Nebel TR-116. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name comes from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (divided into three sections, three divided), as dark dust, the heart of geburtsstätte tells of three parts. </seg>

<seg id="1826"> This image was from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies, (273, the Hubble space telescope for the captured. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our insights into space: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope will warm by Hans Lipperhey invented before Galileo Galilei - be it a year later to observation. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever larger - and the insight they provide, ever deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale telescope in palomar# Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It can look into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner workings of the Gran telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone the mélong to 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The detriment of cheap design: the telescope is at its height, ground to a halt, and limited in his movement. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is in the high angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His characteristic: the high light gathering power. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the mirror of the world&apos;s largest telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers the space for alien signals. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>

<seg id="1852"> The Observatory of the European medical facility in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope - worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors the telescope, the medium-sized infrared spectrum ausleuchten. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Also on the Chilean ESO-Observatorium will the European Extremely Large Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is LetsGoMobile 42 meters include - and from nearly 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> With images, however, is likely until at least 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> By 2007, the two had escaped from telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea fettran as the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums escaped, among them with the subaru# telescope and the IRTTF looks at the sky. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Also on the summit of Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope with a mirror, settlements from 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Here it is on an illustration. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The main impressions from the space, however, the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, it already images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope to IV &quot;- especially for those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011 was captured by the announced that Ciechocinek planetary candidates since the beginning of the mission have been identified. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the picture are the last launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until at least 2018 aboard a Ariane5-Rakete shot into space. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: in light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists estimate that the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements have for decades, suggest that there is ice on the Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Launched in 2004 by the Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists have now a certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1881"> A trace search in the country where 97-Jährige is still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is wild, romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The van caught by surprise on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and lush, one might think that it would in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here, the chū-hai People&apos;s group of taly adds that not much is known, except that they are perfectly Farsi and aser# talks and very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town of flaunts wuchtig to pick from Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists come from Europe Barely here is too onerous for the Azerbaijani capital Baku. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> For the 323 miles you need eight hours, because the street is professional. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The fabulous wealth of the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has not yet arrived. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to the tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and in the next year, we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the Vita of about eight dozen taly adds Babbolone enviremont documented the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years ago a child conceived </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A birth certificate, however, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;She was born here in the region, he died in 1973,&quot; Fatulayeva explained. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man had been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years he is still a daughter testified. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has Şirali Müslümov at his age, charged for a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But also Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, of the elderly in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the hunza valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also in Sardinia live very many very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, especially civil register lacked. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, molten butter cup </seg>
<seg id="1908"> The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik striking a biblis# often with age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why live here in the south so many high elderly? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri travel guide Mugimzadeh Farid said that with the particular genes of taly adds. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But that it should be the calorie rich diet of taly adds, is to be as healthy meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them on a daily basis, drink a glass of molten butter, from a nutritional point of view is not plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original way of life, the young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is for this region is still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, claiming that 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> You are sitting on the ground with a butter keg they tirelessly herrollt back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents. </seg>

<seg id="1921"> Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link under her headscarf conceals her long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly in front of us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have my hair with milk, so they went out and I never kept their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough to </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten only by their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life, I have not once in the supermarket to buy food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she told of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyew took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult of the father figure of the nation, his country as a dictator who ruled that knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Al-Lat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva, here, a sum that we can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps even Mirzayevas long on things son right: &quot;The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> You live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is missing in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution is returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution of Sharia law as the basis is hotly disputed. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian President Division with emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to create the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And that he will succeed is my responsibility to the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was directed to all the people, but above all, to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the Nile of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> He said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed his powers and extended, &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what of the 61-jährige engineer, who holds a PhD from the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary should be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-person constitutional assembly as a late-night, 15-stündigen Parforceritt were pushed through, in part, worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the legal grounds on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was, and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists legally-vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> It has conducted at least one new article: Sharia law in all of these matters should consult with al-Azhar, the main Islamic institution in the country, with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which is the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be preserved. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These dishes served during Mubarak&apos;s rule to the repression of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state should also, as stated in the draft, &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; protect and promote its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is legally so vague, that state institutions, with the help of this article, even the contents of cinema and literature could control. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> There is no article, writes the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Bans for another, the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what an insult is and how they should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally dubious is the wording of the &quot;insult to the people&quot; should be banned. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Open to interpretation, as so much in the draft, Morsi to sign before and after his words &quot;very soon&quot; the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in unaccustomed concord on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed that the Charter, even before they can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution belong &quot;on the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via messaging service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi, a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him,&quot; said the opposition Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,&quot; quoted the Egyptian media, the opposition politician Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that the referendum does not want to monitor, which would be invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> The well organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Bank before the Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and cried: &quot;The people calling for the application of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> You demanded by Morsi: &quot;A cleanse the country!&quot; And extremely: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would have faced a similar situation led to civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The wanted Morsi ’ s supporters clearly not at risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft EU constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> A majority in favour of the Islamists is regarded as safe. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The word &quot;human rights is not even before&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which until February was gone and involve all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or under Mubarak in court. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For that, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the word is human rights, not even in the new constitution,&quot; he said in the interview with the &quot;world on Sunday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi power expansion in all three branches of the State&apos;s lawyer did not give up. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will be a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Rather than to strengthen civil society, the president they have de facto repeal&quot; Saeda complained. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> But without civil society organisations could a democracy does not work. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned by the international community that the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could take revenge. </seg>

<seg id="2009"> There is snow, spectacular landscapes, and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not go away. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is with salt best repented trout, which, depending on how you would like fish stink - up to a year in water ferments. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> In Norway, the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, flows Norwegians to a celebration here in Fagernes, that, well, really very bestechenden speciality. </seg>

<seg id="2016"> I eat some hors d&apos;oeuvres. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it avoids Rakfisk in the nose, he is not bad, such as sushi, which is quite a long bus ride. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in air thick salt water barrels was watered. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, analyzed Will Grant from the BBC the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, several important transport routes in the capital absperrt and on the streets for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, it was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but protesters from Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto&apos;s presidential install and the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the past six years has cost 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence,&quot; said Pena Nieto earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US president Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> With the US president before he went on an equal footing, Pena Nieto as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>

<seg id="2066"> With his name badges are outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect him to real and lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally, Gabriel LAX Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party&apos;s Nietos Pena, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Especially with regard to the security and the economy is concerned, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great Statesman, above all, he was also someone who can listen to. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Tlacopan, also known as Ciudad neza, could the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The village lies hidden under highway, tours and, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> The beginning of this year, the military switched to the drug gangs operating in the zone, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a macules Barrens near a large landfill sites were in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, in the state of Mexico, about 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is responsible for the violence and the killing of innocent women Ordnungspolizei. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that the problem of feminicides during his tenure, at least, is not adequately addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a Betonbau, typical of the decrepit quarter, Irinea Buendia with tears, as they have photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, 2010 Mariana committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed,&quot; remembers Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that they had been beaten, and the body rigid had already begun. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, from the wall is a picture of Mariana on us. It is next to a cross, a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family, we have until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> You want that you just accept their verdict and shut up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions were,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto, install the presidency on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised, particularly during his time in office to attend to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president, he is just as he was as governor,&quot; says the PRI congressman LAX in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most. </seg>

<seg id="2099"> The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in 1908, Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges due to harsh prison conditions </seg>

<seg id="2109"> The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> As Fein him on Friday to the forms, Manning was that the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by the institution as a whole as &quot;very professional&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, Fein contained no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials Manning directly on his treatment had been consulted. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with them, you are not, however, have been logged. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;You wrote (after meeting the concerns)&quot; no problems &quot;, and that meant not necessarily that I said nothing at all,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he has not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, when he met with a committee, which a few months before he referred to a form of suicide, to investigate. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during this meeting have been its observer status to &quot;prevention of injury&quot; downgrading. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said, it was him this restrictive status - one stage under the suicide risk is - on his and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and the observer status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to get rid of a higher quality of life, in my view, to be able to achieve,&quot; said Manning. </seg>

<seg id="2119"> He said that in Kuwait, he contemplated suicide and is due to the heat again become unconscious. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not allowed to know what to do with him or in the outside world is, be burdensome. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell to Camp Arafjon, this cage together,&quot; said Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was transferred to 1908, Manning did most of his days in a small cell, spent at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> It took him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to stay on the move, since the day it was forbidden to sleep, or even lay out. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He always have to sleep with light from the outside in his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> At night, when he turned and guards did not see his face, have it up so that he is back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning in the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge also asked Manning to an accusation that he had made his statement on Thursday, he had a night naked in his cell in 1908 and sleep in a morning count naked before guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had during this count, never had the opportunity to come to terms with its ceiling to umhüllen. </seg>

<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge his prison experiences at least consideration and drastically reduce his prison sentence, he was at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has indicated that Manning is guilty of lesser offences committed, while other charges, which are seen as too extreme to be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the public prosecutor&apos;s office will be a justification of the conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions for all under the highest security arrangements under prisoners in 1908. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> He is found guilty of all charges, he faces a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> &quot;My American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people because of the lack of opportunities were forced to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to emigrants to accuse - they call them in hard times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control when confusion in me wide. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: one for &quot;1989&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;For&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there, a few seconds, uncertain, to which I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and all my life, &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York &quot;Italians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I opted for &quot;Whig amerikanisch&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather&apos;s, there was no need for acronyms or dashes. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language on both ends of the interviews. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues that is expected when the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Sugeria Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc after the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 in Mexico, causing the leadership of the country under the golden gun to budget has forced more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a US officer only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country, complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of zumas go on the war path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> To talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at one point a person in our family tree, perhaps a parent or large parent - was given no chance in Mexico and north immigrated. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person was a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even though we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Perhaps our identity is sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> You can see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Their view, is our existence is a symbol of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families in Mexico have failed, they would not. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not now trapped behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them so badly. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los griegas del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I learned during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> You want to Mexican Americans as provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Is now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many wounded feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you alone, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico to one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members, just not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> After. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace to </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither will be won or lost </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the on 21 November agreed ceasefire continues, this week&apos;s fighting the tough-minded on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group even large losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and densely ’ s corners of the planet will be squeezed, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists in the Arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a heavy, regional power that once regarded as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamic stamp care before the Stürzung Bashar Assad might be, to Jordan, where Hamas allied to the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, by far the largest population and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Brotherhood verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more public opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, even from Israel and the United States will not be pushed out. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defence system, &quot;Iron Dome&quot;, has been able to stand the test of time and many of the Hamas rockets are destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position, many European countries have Hamas for the recent escalation of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has in recent years have fared well, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state œwar. They protect the Jewish settlements, which is in contravention of international law has been declared, but always be developed further. </seg>

<seg id="2268"> Although Australia is one of the lowest rates in the world and the changes are only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations will have to consider other countries have similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It said that the laws would the black-market trade, leading to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>

<seg id="2280"> &quot;Anyone who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, the Internet is not around,&quot; says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman to experience an increase in reports on brands noted that &quot;ordinary people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question must be asked: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that it even includes a video or a marketing agency, has to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing, with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> She has even gone so far, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay for the new rules, those countries to complain to the World Trade Organisation over unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia. </seg>

<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government has held talks with other countries, are considering similar packaging laws. </seg>

<seg id="2288"> These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>

<seg id="2296"> &quot;I have an hour earlier, a delivery sort it, now I need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government would simply completely ban cigarettes - then we said okay, that&apos;s it, we close,&quot; he was visibly angry. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In all the world as it is beautiful, also to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport when the plane was due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another flight. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax free shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and child development experts führen boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children - OK, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This is the brain in interesting thoughts to lose, and possibly the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on one or other screen rigid, brings us the benefits of boredom, not more. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should the boredom so welcome with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> To I come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;I: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom of a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls fossils has a Latin graffiti on boredom, which in the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define actually boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood&apos;s, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood&apos;s and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, &quot;a satisfactory job, but this is not to&quot; define. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not considered, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a &quot;disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can listen to almost as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood&apos;s believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that we are boring, even if we only have trouble us. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study &quot;The if O&apos;Rourke Mind: defining I in Terms of Attention&quot; - German, for example: &quot;The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention&quot;, which in September in the journal &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; appeared, Professor Eastwood&apos;s and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these sounds are not heard. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who are barely recognisable television heard in more boring than the other two groups, they have had problems, too, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If, on the other hand, a dreary work performed, &quot;as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help, not to feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can fight even by people who are physically more closely. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people get bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a &quot;scale to Lange Review26 vulnerability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale are statements such as &quot;Many things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monoton&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such scales, researchers found that boys and girls will be more boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers with quite a lot more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contact. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework you were bored, whereas 23%, to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of the parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He was sure, however, that &quot;the youth is seen as the most boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: is boredom healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people are extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them, studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom is the brain of a saying that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what you should do it best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is dull and the energy used to play guitar and cooking, will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television may make sense for good in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> If his bored child an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It is not, however, learned to themselves or to maintain control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;Self-regulation is conveyed from one situation to the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to maintain, but gains in other areas more self-control. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not to be critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to us away from the constant Aktivitäts wohlzufühlen berieselung and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood&apos;s agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds more often than we would have to be boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people in truth only, look for a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly to be stimulated, it is hard to deal with, even if the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Who the community college student and football player Anthony Orozco recognizes is in southeast Colorado court for a crime in this country will soon be legal: the possession of marijuana and a pipe, has less of it these rauchte. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco recognizes that he and some friends were in a Septembertag car in Lamar, near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco recognizes for possession of drugs and drug utensils load - excusable peccadilloes, each with a fine of $100 for - and received a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We will be treated like criminals,&quot; said Orozco recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalise the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offences less from the law, as the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences that turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures that have already been dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years no longer for possession on a small scale. This is permitted by law, once the new laws in the next few weeks will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced, to quote the marijuana offences and people are still in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in several cities to the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains about new state licensed marijuana operations at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so quickly that I didn&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington is puzzled scratch on the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> You are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, it is of the view that Colorado in any case, most States ahead is what the regulation of marijuana. It was the drug only for medical purposes and then for private consumption legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is so good for orientation,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, which we can follow,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6 and is thus the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the property is legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practical issues must be resolved at this time, such as the government target of a &quot;reasonable access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere is it more difficult, a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis &quot;, a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora, in which he declared that the prosecutor would be smaller marijuana offences in people over 21 years ago no longer, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; not to seek a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers will continue to be pursued. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in the north of Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck a harsher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to consumers on the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, while many others have been charged with offences. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our agency has a duty to pursue infringements, tatzeit point about crimes was&quot;, Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the rural constituency, shows adults for possession of small quantities of no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District prosecutor Pete skin these issues on supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding property procedure. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions throughout the state, local officials encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> With county prosecutors if it were a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver for marijuana offences representing the defendants in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;You have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute people for the legalisation of still cannot accept,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first States to deal with small amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national test cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they are also nervous on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level continue to treat as a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators no doors will probably occur in smaller quantities of drugs seizures, but will probably resist, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana transactions to tolerate. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado are not the fact that the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana operations, although this is only open in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We are not in a position where we license someone and then at the federal level have a huge problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the change in the law. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are then, for which the community has decided, and not after, for which the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: i was mobbed from Oxford, because I am Tory </seg>

<seg id="2408"> It has always been my biggest dream, a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once for the largest knowledge temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, which is the major pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance. </seg>

<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was harassed for one reason only - a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment so parochial and cruel seemed: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I have been a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, current reportedly suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution. </seg>

<seg id="2428"> The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: &quot;There is a growing leftward trend in universities. </seg>

<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the equivalent of the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but also happily attended. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues such as the miners strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa had found their way into the wood panelled rooms of Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century, translated into English. On what should come, I have not been taken. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the tutor Harry Pitt (live), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I stumbled. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face as a gate, and how much. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Refuse Thatcher fans, French to learn, or are they simply stupid?&quot; He asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students kicherten. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> To see tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that you in your free time between a couple of hours, so if you are not too much with your social activities are employed,&quot; growled to Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room with hängendem head in. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> On this evening, I sat in the College alone at dinner, when someone easily typed on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is, as it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is being harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the Tory incoming claim, supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub, I tried later to me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I do not at all points of view with Mrs. Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A young student in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the conservative current Eton College, said to me: &quot;You&apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How did Tories sex?&quot; Asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The beat each other? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States have had to have felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> I would ever be able, at Oxford University to lead a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would like-minded only after dark can take? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years before me, in my mind is extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only one who openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> It was not only hated, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was only rarely. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place found him provincial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-Leninist deterministic historical perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he was a visiting professor at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Thou shalt not be happy here,&quot; he said to me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began between Oxford and the house of my parents to move and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the four Luxor were all political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Something they would never do, not in my city of Pakistan spires. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes marred. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Enter the whole a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that you only get teased. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break my heart, if you go. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance weaker. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a Tutoriums the following week, in which another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I&apos;ve decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I secretly zerging in shame, I am my parents a &quot;brainwashing&quot; had been subjected to, and called it &quot;old stupid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was closed. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my Häscher. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> As they went, I grabbed a bag and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Like you can call me a wine EU-Seychelles schlapp# series. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-Jährige should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And even more tragic is that there was a University of Oxford, who not only 14 Tory, but up to now behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2594"> The SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s blame to ensure that they do not have children, to the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rapper# songs, the local slogans such as &quot;it will be a&quot; Perhaps &quot;(loaf) in the oven, the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun of. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, which the video was filmed, is the hope that the advert on funny way, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of music to the people to make their &quot;national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The breed, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed optimization evenings (fast flirting). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as to compose a Rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children, </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this issue is not easy, is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage the public to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government grants for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But has so far had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why not get the SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Ming, Director for marriage and family policies of the national population authority, says that this is a &quot;better training&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This is the people, except to marry and have a family to make a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities have the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy has led to a sharp increase in the more targets for the reduction of the population, to resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the few generations xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, the criticism that they maintain low wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Of unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> It has also had an impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to check the &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are known and in certain areas of the city should be built. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a huge sales success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that the lifestyle of the people living alone can promote, and that they discourage the construction of large housing for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company el Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; much faster than larger units sell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> You are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This means that they are for our cash flow are much better. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> It is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles in the way, if they have too many small residential units in a project to build. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could cause is the talks with the Singapurern, working in the financial district, says that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The children can get others. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;It is important for me, on my own money and time,&quot; says another, about 20 years old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women in their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they have no children. </seg>

<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; with the publication of these pages, but the rules have changed,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master permit in education at Yale University and author of &quot;Digital Natives and Immigrants&apos; these words to explain the phenomenon formed. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The Digital Natives, they are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, even though we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand that they have a defined criteria, which is widespread, published or cannot be said, in an age where the maturity that is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;You should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, they think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;You have to say that they should not do it, is not working,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras, then some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like, when it published a photo of you, as you&apos;ve published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know what the other about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Do you have other people asked for permission in advance, if you have photos of celebration labelled? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: will all have to know what you do at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks,&quot; he explains. </seg>

Sources in the heads of state and presidential office initially told that they would be handed over to the conclave, said later, however, that there is some time on the website of the Peruvian government would be published. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> If you have any questions on the text they gave that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press said. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists&apos; access to information about the summit was at any time. </seg>

<seg id="2711"> Then the president of Peru, sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final statement&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala was not the official document on the conclusion of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru, host of the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite emphatic request by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously announced, just published. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and remains a country that is on the international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and international courts,&quot; adds Piñera nowlook clicked his heels and gave Humala with handshakes before the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, after Colombia for a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake to take action against the agreement of Bogota had made what it agreed to the judgments of the international tribunal. </seg>

<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The head of state read the final document, which it announced in a statement that 16 decisions and the courses for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment of a total of 17 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship will make the decisions on what we extend residency rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that measures would be promoted to &quot;cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to access to medicines and on the Internet at low prices to improve in all areas of South America and in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is designed to expand our production capacity and our people to a better future,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided that a number of 31 flagship projects to give priority to the geographical ties in South America, especially in rural and border areas to improve... and therefore our countries unite and develop a new type of business,&quot; said the Peruvian President, in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the horizontal axes of his area of the coast to Brazil Schuldvermutung, and with two for a better connection with Ecuador to ensure, even though he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document to the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations serves&quot;, which it currently is excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America continues to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect of the summit said. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he was in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his opposite number of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime conflict after a question from Bogota in the judgment of the ICJ respectfully. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I will tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways, they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua make talks with Nicaragua is necessary,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope the President Ortega be able to say that we take this matter as civilized and respectful as possible to deal with,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention of the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto to be present. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, also in the run-up to the defence ministers of the bloc to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the latter country currently is excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, &quot;South America really can learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, of the 6th summit of the presidents of the Unasur (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans&apos; in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing &quot;and&quot; today is practically a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project, a South American citizenship, which the member States of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of the Republic of Ecuador also advocated the reshaping of the Organization of American States (OEA will be held under the premise that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and those that take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights have signed. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans are everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States,&quot; he said alluding to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has conceded. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights&quot; is fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it was &quot;well-founded suspicions have given that Assange extradited to a third country, and his trial was not respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which required him to its territory because of an alleged sex may therefore, while &quot;the Swedish law allows this via a video conference with the Embassy of Ecuador in London would be executed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Since then he has been in our message is, I have not spoken with him, but the ambassador has informed me that he had a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,&quot; said the leader of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger, though, that his physical and mental damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and no physical exercises carried out in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That would affect the health of all people,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa has said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was granted, the granting of a free briefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe&apos;s synnerligen. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, that we are not in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European authorities,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain this morning this licence granted, I believe that this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype to interrogate, as the Swedish law allows and in other cases, is the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa used the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, &quot;the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is no longer such journalists &quot;and not by the bankers or hegemonic and having dominated civil countries&apos;, and I think he in a re-election&quot; will deepen the revolution in the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;must be firm and no opportunism and none as legally wood-panelled coup should be held,&quot; because &quot;the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of the Republic of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua America» ahead with Nicaragua in the maritime border between the two countries to negotiate for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Currently, this judgment is not being implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they are in pursuit of a common path to be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> You have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that they look forward and overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He is also familiar to a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America, international bodies, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In relation to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, his third consecutive mandate in order to achieve that, he admitted that he has this opportunity &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that, if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he will withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the belief that it was the probable victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I win, it would be my last term as president, then I retreat from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This is also true that if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I was just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. He told me that he is a planned, routine treatment have visited, and expected that he would return after the election campaign could travel to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It is, in any case back in the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorean leader today in Lima, the Sixth Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), with the call for greater regional integration has been terminated for sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry confirmed: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb hit,&quot; he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take up just about his illness and started to inform themselves; and that with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz# virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was hard to imagine that there are many doubts, few treatment options and more murderous mata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of the MSSI to adopt, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> AIDS at the time was a synonym for death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible that this syndrome with quality of life to survive. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, many people still come to the clinic, which none of their disease and know where the virus has already caused damage and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, &quot;means the great success that the survival of patients, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly right,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, but he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people depended on the beginning of the treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 and 50 years by a count of 500 by. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above comments mean that anyone under the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, &quot;can be easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> This progress, to be reminded that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduces), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of the national database covers patients have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Die - Why so people still remember? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, is the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, in other words, very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a strong statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where it is needed, screening tests need to be offered on a massive scale.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de las del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, of his test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi&apos;s Sarcoma (a krebsart# hoş tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I was going to die, then three times to burst,&quot; says one in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to suggest improvement, I ernähre me good practise sport and take the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Now know his parents only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I am working, do a lot, have an active and responsible sex lives, I respect to my health and that of the other person,&quot; numbereth Fabrizio, the ” its intimate details with Milenio JALISCO, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of world AIDS Day fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to live as all the people responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this particular places &quot;was the distribution of condoms actually increases; previously, they were made separately, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> To the high-risk individuals for new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need?&quot; Is a common taunt issue of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and healthcare system, the young people do not want to expose them, the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested that these inefficient distribution newly oriented; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilets of institutions, which are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under his administration would be distributed condoms. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>

<seg id="2829"> You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the Stars and Stripes is contrary to international agreements have no validity. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judges at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale for the Northern District of Texas on the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> While the judge the matter indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law in the United States must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings in Mexico&apos;s trade to the bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that the international cooperation in case of default by companies with trans-national profile is not known. </seg>

<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies in recognition of the liabilities in the estate of the branches of vitro with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the debt would have been reached. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade bankruptcies) confirmed. </seg>

<seg id="2844"> It is not, will the Cerciorare-Einspruch, the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The serious in this case is that the court has set aside a document by the government of Mexico under the amicus curiae figura (friend of the court) has been sent to the vitro procedure carried out within the framework of the law on trading bankruptcies, and pointed out that it strictly abide by the agreements signed by the two countries had kept the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2871"> &quot;My life, I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s was,&quot; recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes exaggerates this statement is not. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all with photos and memories of his long career, decorated and testify. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The heart Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From then, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good manager, &quot;says Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that I am Gene Bartow, who has worked as a teacher and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a very strong and 2 metres wide players. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> If you want to? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow recommended then free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, go through naturalisation, and one of our best one. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember, as he said that if a championship for Mincy Bayamon, Gausse for another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the Vaqueros Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> This time, he moved it to its executions and Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we first the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup in 1990, when the fourth place, but what should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been the last game of the second time repeated, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This group of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who work in the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team won. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> My favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the US is a struggle, as when it against us in the World Cup won bronze. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &apos;Piculín&apos; (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) &apos;Toñito&apos; Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario&quot; Quixote &quot;Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, it was not. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that in terms of personalities, perhaps not the best, but we won a gold medal and great joy, who was on the vorolympischen tournament in 1995, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every forecast, we won the gold medal. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best players from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico, at this level so as Piculín dominated. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that, without his career in different leagues, in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a number of good trainers as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What you think is the best thing that you have achieved in the association? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, the beginning of the 1990s BSN up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only play in the national playoffs to teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children make many unnecessary travel and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I can see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, official and referee. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you play today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side. </seg>
