<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans to justify its policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center for the latter holds a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada are the US states for the conduct of elections in the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of the American government has announced since 2009, new laws that make the process for the registration or the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained after the elections in November 2010 in importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states have been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills have been introduced in 2011 that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that the voter photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship present. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, the periods for the early vote shortened, declared invalid for the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens through these laws also denied the right to vote, for which there is a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006 has no US state of the voters required to show photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, who has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, they fostered in 34 states of draft legislation that voters are forced to produce photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens, unlike Quebec does not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, with 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters people not by a government authority of their state-issued photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million in 2012 Neuwähler do not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, more than a hundred dollars are often required to pay to obtain the required identification. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions on young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, with 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, do not have the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are regarded as voters who cast their votes more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their of their establishment issued photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs that stronger for the Republican side choose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Clearly, these measures aim to limit the Hispanic votes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters was abolished on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups limited to provide assistance to those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns have to register voters in the general election in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 has decreased compared to 2006 by 17%. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws that seek to shorten the period for early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election in 2008 were in Florida, 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, while only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same is true for the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the whites, who constituted 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, have opposed the Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously passing laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require showing a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim of influencing the results in the decisive state for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in the electoral system, the legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: These new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: The test should be done or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test point indeed sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to a greater reluctance of cowardly men for the implementation of screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The studies carried out in the United States, many disturbances between the control group, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in mortality rates of patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed that the probability of the formation of metastases is at an observation post after 12 years by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, who had been ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men, Afro-American origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that aggressive and others who are Indo-. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The extent of the risk to the patient&apos;s cancer must be made very clear by the options available to him, where prostate crabs can remain untreated, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it opts for a more active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, there is no treatment for many men, where it has detected cancer, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in progression of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy is one of the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the most important thing is to talk with your doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA tests to evaluate. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Disease prevention of </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no smoking this value would rise to at least 50%&quot;, André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain unresolved completely. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem the risk for breast, colon wrath, fattening bowel, for cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sausages, should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage the cells, and the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But their investigations are currently not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study has to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also not yet shown. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk with your doctor about his concerns and his family history. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs quantum analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs Bosons last summer, has caused a stir, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> In fact, it is believed that this quantum state is involved in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And, finally, is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model whose existence - our best or &quot;least wrong&quot; explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but not yet observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs quantum state. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, it seems to be confirmed by new data, which this week on a large physics-congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data, in order to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, apparently because there is only a small risk to deceive themselves, and we take a look at what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world, there is a necessarily inevitable law, that means that two objects may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not too much, because you are hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also such a law: The Pauli exclusion principle, &quot;which says that two particles can&apos;t occupy the same space at the same time, if they find themselves in the same&quot; quantum state, &quot;but this&quot; condition is &quot;largely from some of their properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the physicists a share the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens who are described as Fermione and suddenly the obey. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move the boson, a nasty gang of anarchists, for whom nothing is sacred, certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in fact, at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The meson, which we will not deal with the &quot;strength and particle,&quot; by which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs quantum somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> However, it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read these chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The Photon, or the &quot;light particle,&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field precisely in this place, &quot;disturbed&quot; is, like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Through these &quot;disorder an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.&quot;), and this wave is nothing more than a publicity, and thus one of the boson &quot;carrier of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true for the Higgs quantum state, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, &quot;&quot; must be disturbed, so that this quantum state. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to very high energy, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks but could be. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Therefore, a giant like the CERN particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve that kind of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again help to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets are doing this, but others do not, for example, would never think of a sheet of paper on the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the other (as a result) no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> But for all this research can now be good, &quot;Mrs Plamondon asks? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to study all the differences between the observations and predictions of the SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also a number of physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could be a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; open and plug some holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter is still major deficiencies, because there is no explanation of the force of gravity (ups!) and offers dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, such differences were not found at the CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way: In the early 1960s were the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and was developed in 1962, the first time line were the first laser (NI), said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a &quot;laboratory gimmick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> It also can arise applications from all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, Willard Boyle, in turn, has developed in 1969 during his work at a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor, all digital cameras around the world today as &quot;eye&quot; and have earned him the Nobel Prize for physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that we can never really know it... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le DAAD </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;death with dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will be resumed in the near future, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this important area remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The DAAD has tried to look at this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, which aufzehrte him, had left him a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have managed to seven years,&quot; he said, half-heartedly, in his bed at the home for relative Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock, it cannot be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its work: A vast weakness prevents him from going to the toilet, and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> On the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees in resignation to help with food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Bravely manages to smile, and even to talk with the stranger who work around him, give him his medication, and give him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing in the Swedish,&quot; says Pierre players, a psychologist at the Home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back in the childhood phase for certain people is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept a step backwards, he noted. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people who work in the relative, major events taking place in the midst of these setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients, who lived in the home for relative Victor-Gadbois admitted, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> You have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, they are swamped by the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care. </seg>

<seg id="170"> &quot;I have&quot; good children, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I had no wish more in life, she says, before she accepts that it invokes a mask that helps her to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> In the next few days, there is still a recent visit of her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteer body care and assistance in terms of food intake. </seg>

<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to the relative, that is, to a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients if the latter have reached the final stage of her life, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organizations, such as the home-Victor Gadbois and the Society for domestic relative in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> These very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the relative specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October, a manifesto is in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures in the relative as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to a high-quality relative before accepting and euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, no one has taken measures to alleviate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions hard until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, when she broke off an arduous chemotherapy. </seg>

<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was at the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff that it has not agreed to this request, have been relieved of their pain by a team of relative. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it must be said clearly that the relative is in pain treatment Omni potent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to ameliorate Monereau, head of the relative of the society of domestic relative of Montreal 8% of patients to a pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, the doctors are often back to the terminal sedation, which amounts to sporadic patients either permanently or asleep by the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we perceive this side of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain is relieved, all say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, &apos;I want you asleep me, &quot;but&quot; I want my pain is relieved. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of raids and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, who is mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is alleged to have received in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Moreover, engineers explicitly accused of road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused a stir when he said the Commission of the functioning of the &quot;system&quot; for the preservation of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has several years paid 3% of the value of the contracts to a preserved in Montreal with the Mafia related mediator, who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr zambito has everywhere in the 2000s had his hand in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) at provincial parties, especially the Liberal Party was in power at the time. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also confessed to organizing an illegal fund raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him. </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former civil engineer Gilles surprenant put it before the Commission described in detail: In 10 years he received from the construction company gifts, free trips, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 in exchange for sewer contracts, costing it artificially pumping up. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they lubricate left by the bills with false additional services artificially inflated by 30-40%. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay has accused that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, who blew the whistle. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the municipality Rivière-of-prairies, in the eastern part of the island, rejected them from 2010 against the sale of parish property, purchased for $5 million and 1.6 million in property developers in the booming real estate market has been sold. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of black money in the election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The study, carried out in the end, she says that she is &quot;on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the ants under immigration system to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> She says that the procedure &quot;was painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are going to clean the wound, but only for Montreal would need a certain investigative unit, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> A regular. </seg>
<seg id="245"> For his part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is especially concerned about the role of the &quot;mandate, which are about the tactics in the picture,&quot; if they were not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he provide: &quot;I was told that it was just a poor substitute for the reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes that the donations to political parties to $100 to limit what he says nothing about the situation would change, &quot;as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, will be black money in politics in circulation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the procurement and the financing of political parties: &quot;We cannot fall deeper; if we do the things with courage to the bottom, we can build the house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec and Montreal that Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Can you explain him through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have come. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I make progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has given me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements encourage me every day to improve my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game, it is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything goes very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not break out in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You have the advantage of competing introduced by Carlo Jeff... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The new entrants this summer are accustomed to carry games very high levels. </seg>
<seg id="264"> You also know that every training session is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player like me want to offer the forehead and give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Jeff gives me a lot in terms of my game. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Jeffs is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Jeff gives all the technicians respect. </seg>
<seg id="271"> The Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will win more titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At that time, I had just recovered from an injury. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top rider. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We qualified in this way for the first knockout round. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we are against very good European teams have a say about our word. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want to be first in our group in Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the eighth and final home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> In the short term, the PSG can be a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already been the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG is the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Would it be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it is really concerned; this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season, we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have concluded with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, it should be with 79 points champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux is contending for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> That the media are expecting too much from the PSG think? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot of us is expected. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept that completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we were in a home game against Troyes 4-0 win, and it still is something that you can accuse us, this is certainly a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to draw up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds up over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have proven strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, an association of creates for two seasons, failed to qualify for the first knockout round, and who has also made huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the amount you invested thought to break with 15 points ahead. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of the equation. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were from this new PSG &quot;geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> That the Ligue 1 is exciting shows. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we have won it, despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better that one by one &quot;that dependence&quot; talks. </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Inter is powerful and many goals shoots. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is really extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This is an incentive for others to improve their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the world&apos;s best defenders, it also allows all others to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You have seen how the European Championships in 2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was anxious to take part in this European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me to squeeze a little game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things, from which I am emerged stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I will be able to realize good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was my baptism with the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and now we have to set an example. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views &quot;on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the&quot; Bleus? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strictly, which is close to the players and stimulates the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to make no comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved his goal, he had qualified for the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the &quot;Bleus&quot; to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The questions on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) is a prelude game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has worked for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin paying and selling is possible without bank </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, a political vision is as often happens in these technologies tangible: The belief that the current, financial crises of bank monopolies designed monetary system. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Indeed, that is convertible by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.), as well as a protocol for the secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been collected. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the course of Bitcoin reached in June 2011, a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros), five months later, he fell to 2 dollars before today, he has recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly tried compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October virtual currencies have shown interest. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She describes as a &quot;virtual currency Bitcoin with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that can be used to make progress in a video game, you win by playing or buy back (and sometimes). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Each time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, securities depository account book, auditors, money-issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How this network work? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose to pay a different address, which ensures the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A series of this transaction-related data will be signed electronically through a double encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the account book in the entire network of widespread public accounts. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is to sign this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is happening on a mathematical task that will start on computers, with the winners, which is a sort of provisional central banker has the privilege of this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a Zerstückeln of the file, the conversion of a large file, i.e., in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers, &quot;&quot; the new transaction and add the number before the whole thing will be hacking. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus linked permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user wants to pay twice for cheating, very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, one of the two transactions would only be validated by the network, and the other has no link, because they have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The circulating Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some leeway. </seg>
<seg id="380"> It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites, the services for Bitcoin, were attacked and the Bitcoin-deposit stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The weakness is not the real record,&quot; Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium assures that a company to pay with real money and the network Bitcoin uses. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, cash has also these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they are accepted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Dorit Ron Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the invoice book analyzes and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, was a &quot;mega-sale&quot; started. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged, Jon Holmquist, who works for the company coin Abul looks forward, converts the Bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper but it uses. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, the holder manages its identity and thus can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can be easily implemented with retailers, and the latter must have no new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> You just need an address, photographed by a telephone &quot;and&quot; can be detected, Pierre Noizat indicates that assures that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There has been a general trend in which hierarchical systems will be reviewed for more horizontally oriented systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take some time until Bitcoin prevails, but could be a turning point in 2013,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB does in her report that different to assess today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are withdrawn from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their responsibility in the Kapisa and Surobi (Afghanistan). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States are likely to follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers, we have seen as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, and the injured and crippled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who refuse an armed international presence, as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> You want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerance, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries are discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have watched from a landscaped hill with almond trees, was financed with the help of French loans properly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The lorry exceptionally of helicopters and tanks and convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, there will be no more course of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul empty, and the country was excessive because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The takeover was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organization Al-Qaeda overwhelmed farmers paid, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahedin, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The key figures of the anti-Soviet war in 2001, came back to power. </seg>
<seg id="418"> You have turned into this racket, they have seized land by the government to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> I have heard it in the campaign, the people want a government that is made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who were able to take advantage of the American contributions: The flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, which is one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties nor for the corruption of some executives, one will have to provide jobs. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All the armed parties are obsessed with mobile phones, television with his Turkish series, which is a modern world is seen everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> An army is now available. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities will, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of Western nations, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which had existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make him from a centralised state with a strong presidential algae Walt. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai wants no foreign controls, especially during the 2014 elections planned for April. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country since the 1950s and before long dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries have not been rebuilt, functional congestion works are not available and major irrigation system has not been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables produced nothing. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative is left the priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been required. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without the energy to handle the iron smelting or ground, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have left the Mes Aynak copper mine of almost, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site their excavations and remain the most important employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports to resume normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Junior high schools for boys and girls, Institute for French universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support of the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, has a service &quot;civilian-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages, many charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation making to try the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; to win and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, for which many local workers were required to have been able to help to suppress the uprising: Irrigation wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil conservation and increase of farmland. </seg>
<seg id="447"> The souvenir, we are back to military spending by two billion? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions in these often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres lying valleys very tough. </seg>
<seg id="449"> In the message, dozens of written questions of small projects of communities in the province of Kapisa made. </seg>
<seg id="450"> So that farmers have shed the uprising led by foreign groups, according to their own statements, continuing their desire would be lower, well controlled and directly relevant civilian aid in their favor. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new poker game of President Mohammed while Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt regarding the constitutional declaration that grants him temporarily the unlimited authority, more than ever, it remains divided, he decided to go for broke. </seg>
<seg id="454"> To the surprise of everyone he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day in its final version. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Egypt is now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>

<seg id="590"> Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country. </seg>

<seg id="603"> What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, spokesman for the migration agency reply that it seeks to reduce the number of forced laborers. </seg>

<seg id="606"> However, their rights must be protected even before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> On problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant languages will inevitably face without people with evil intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will stay with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much her fault as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also provide a sound basic education. </seg>

<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="626"> It also costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The staff of the Russian police know that our most falsified documents and we are not registered, and cases of extortion. </seg>

<seg id="633"> The falsified papers were printed with a normal color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners were it not for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to spare as the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates are not available for simple, are both officials and civil rights activist. </seg>
<seg id="637"> For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers who fall for the first time by the test, promising only that it is time for a language course. </seg>

<seg id="690"> Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez sought in the mid-1990s as buyers of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> According to him, the scheme has not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He got a photo album, which was shown everything possible. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like&quot; in the luxury goods, the military personnel recalls. </seg>
<seg id="695"> According to the buyer gets Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As a potential customer, I just don&apos;t buy, but ride with the seller in the forest, and there we have a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I can shoot it there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot we negotiate with each other,&quot; the expert, describes the action. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shopping from the couch </seg>
<seg id="699"> Internet search engine results to websites and groups in &quot;VKontakte&quot; where weapons &quot;for different purposes will be offered&quot; show. </seg>
<seg id="700"> It will not require any papers, there is a personal meeting. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;You need just the right amount of money,&quot; says in the advertisement on the website &quot;fight gun or rifle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> There, users to give your orders and requests. </seg>
<seg id="703"> It is also sold to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Of course, without a license,&quot; asks users &quot;Ivan&quot; (direct quote). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;Buy a TT. Moscow&quot; is the question of &quot;Fedorenkow deranged.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Security Service recently turned countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service galore. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The people are as hungry fish in feeding and then end up in Siberia and must fix coal </seg>
<seg id="708"> The military commentator and former military Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard of the scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Officials to take the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer transfers the money from a bank machine. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, he gets a photo and a description of the captivity of the weapon,&quot; the spokesperson says the nonprofit organization &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; Dmitri Kislow. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranez points out that you can start to finish empty and come behind bars when placing a question on a website. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service recently turned countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service galore. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The people are as hungry fish in feeding and then end up in a Siberian labor camp and must fix coal,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="716"> A Makarow for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislow &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; you can buy a gun type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> You have to wait up to one and a half months. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The weapon is spent in military arsenals of middle-ranking supervisors. </seg>
<seg id="721"> The official statistics of the Interior Ministry, the number of offences with illegal arms across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and devices shrank by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the United States are striking fast-food and supermarket-workers </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting behind the cash register at some point of Mc Donald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, it was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell further or whether they will soon be back in the air. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart- and fast-food workers are monitoring the organizers of the protests aimed to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy is not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, which sell-outs were held in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and his mother, together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain aimed at lower- and middle-income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, buy many of the Walmart-only slightly paid employees at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart into one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often so cheap, because the employees are paid poorly. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about severe conditions, for example, lack of forklift or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the protest at the &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company&apos;s own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart-employee who 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> There are about 1.1% more than they donate now for pay. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If the wage increases Walmart fully pass to the customers, cost of each purchase them in the future, only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> It would be a year for them, compared to more spending by only 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it came only in nine states to protests and the company gave no losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took into his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of the Walmart-cash at the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees work laid down and the protest action &quot;just another PR trick&quot; of the union, which organized the protest, was. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests were this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which in this progressive city not wanted and so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and other inexpensive restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the company sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law stands at $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food restaurants will gradually raise the minimum wage, but not too much, and, on average, get their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one less than they deserve in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school at McDonald&apos;s behind the counter, however, the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No one saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now you meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s constant people who complain that they get along with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is the forum of the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, a comment, whose author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children, if one does not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants of the protests, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&apos;s in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, as more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It further demanded the formation of unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the corporate governance, to stand in the way of that goal and union members to dismiss or issue early warnings. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, it makes the corporate governance not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason for the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> With them, </seg>
<seg id="767"> There have been vocal protests on that day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The climax of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we should together, the fast-food employees support so that they receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from everyone in the fast-food industry are employed in the tens of thousands in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether these protests will be the spark mobilize whole mass. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately on lists.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Supporters of modern technology in the popular theme of augmented reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Google first presented in the summer at its annual conference a working model in November was then known, that Microsoft had filed for a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It irritates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - you briefly describe what your research group operates. </seg>
<seg id="779"> We deal with the interaction between man and machine, however, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the human race is largely stuck in the phase, which works with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years, and the radical changes this interaction foresee. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the sensors take a step forward, and today is no longer sold without taking Xbox, since all motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although taking brought the interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, work on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to let the computer world into our physical world and make them more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> There is, however, a need that not only the users, but also recognized his surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could add to the real world much easier through virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First of all, we need these silly VR helmets los! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about language control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - it is certainly not the solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it would not always have all the others his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we were working in the area of governance of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, with sweeping gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not from the object camera, but recorded by a bracelet, which registered the movements of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Still, it is relatively large, could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But overall, the future belongs, however, mixed management types, such gestures and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How? </seg>
<seg id="800"> We would like to ask you, for example, to offer you these jets can? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say it, and at the same time point. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Normally, I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to detect. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - does this mean, you want the user adapt to what can make a machine at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think we will have to work in the next time, especially in the development of new types of sensors that allow it to capture reactions from people. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The laser sensors can be, for example, because they offer in the depths of a good resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What claims make based on your work with the Xbox Take-sensors to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> &quot;Of course, would be at a speed of 1,000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the pipeline itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only the resolution along the X and the y-, but also along the Z-axis are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of frames per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of people have said very dynamic and open, the current 30 fps especially for gestures are too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond, a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors are closer on the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much that the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I needed for my work as a device, only without contact control and with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - had to be increased the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Take is currently working with three cameras, &quot;one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second a receiver for the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the object deep. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could solve the problem.... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be a flexible, Take-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how during the three-dimensional investigation of a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft presented his glasses, not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that the lens has regarding the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, it is not pleasant to keep logging a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: The most amazing version would be a &quot;changing&quot; enhanced reality in which we could on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone switch </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal gadget and its strength (private) is you can only see, but also its weakness, because prevented an enlarged reality through glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> It is a problem that critics often point out this idea is that there is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="834"> The group wants to give the answers to this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often talk about the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method, the use of second-hand is currently as something unusual projection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure well. </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the &quot;pictures in the air&quot; something tangible, for example, the interference by some ultrasonic radiation directed at a certain point the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still so weak, when someone blows over the knuckles. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in your finger, it is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to outflank the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> It can think that it can feel what it should feel if it looks just a bit? </seg>
<seg id="843"> It is a good idea, so we have tried it yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a person who is physically in a closed room to believe hides, he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we are working on plans with treadmills (other than in gyms, movable platforms and large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain is only moderately on lists, and we still have a lot of work-years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: On many issues, we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Their own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt continues the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde,&quot; which is dedicated to urban dwellers who form the vanguard of the art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the select list already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city, and they often find recognition in Europe landed without being in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of the extravagant Rosbalt artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, sometimes with scene-meeting or private viewings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images are issued by Kirill Miller, they attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social and philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and conjured up by his presence on the streets of his fellow citizens and smile at them for good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and was felt at the Petersburg barrel organ player, as he is for this difficult role in terms of his artistic life, his philosophy and his image is finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why you&apos;re always in red and yellow and turquoise, for example, through the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red, the compromise between artist, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the company of anything that deviates from the norm is, aggression and bad behavior. </seg>
<seg id="861"> However, I will come through my provocations with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Each of my past provocations an invitation for a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When you knew that you have to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In the main exhibition in the Palace of Culture, where my work were on display. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that I have to go down this path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter went back to an end, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friends with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; it was &quot;Pushkinskaya 10,&quot; and then end was only once. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It takes me to the theater, to the fashion, to music, to everything except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all united in your kind clinic... - it was important for me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best artists congregate. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied an area in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there were up to the renovation of a musical and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: NAME., Tequilajazzz, and I remember well how cord came with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore T-shirts, and close to them belonged to the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, &quot;Leningrad&quot; was from her. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of &quot;Halli Galli-.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery &quot;D&quot; or the club &quot;137 Griboedov&quot; originate in the art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, meant as a culture. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, there was a poll in the press, which was about the award &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artist of the year,&quot; and I was arrived at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At present, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous to do without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your work has a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - many of my pictures are real pearls and bring out the timeliness and sharpness of thought. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be an exhibition with the theme &quot;The Russian museum have&quot; as clowns. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was socially, but now it hurts and fear, so to be. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Let us save the world, for example, by telling people that everyone has completely. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the exterior and not on the inside of the human being. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not be a person&apos;s hand, but should he spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception disappears through the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we saw you in the role of urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and be flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people were large groups: The bohemian loved one and the ordinary people of the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now, you&apos;ll have to think about whom you will like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult star has about 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - Among the appearances of several thousand Boneheads Michailow come! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - On him come abandoned women, there is the sexually-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and everything is based. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have supporters, and the most important thing is to cheat them and destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were hung from a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It intellectual culture and consumer culture means. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, which is quite another. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and money refused to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good culture experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> They say: Servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real tsars, it was different, because the Czars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are needed. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have, the way could be the experts, but they are blocked because it requires more high-level experts who assess the former right and clear the way for them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now, only the own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same is true for the Erarta, must, however, with the difference that they say honestly that they do not accept all contemporary art and some artists find so other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Petersburg - What is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg - is not the European Capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones art can grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers and readers, and that is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious people visit the exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> Us that are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art needs to be modern, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> In danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or clash with killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space ships with Erdbewohnern aboard are on the search for a replacement. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are many choices, in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Indeed, &quot;Mars and Venus,&quot; says the scientific staff of Astronomisches Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> While the conditions on Mars, however, are relatively pro-life, a temperature of 500 degrees exists on the surface of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would only be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, possible in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The question of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first with regard to the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of in-orbit bred peas was not in the least of the species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects,) of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila, in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it needs to be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; says the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without a solid surface the chicks in the wild. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later, stumpften the instincts of the newborn. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Four days later, she died then. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We have lost twice chicks hatch and then abandoned it, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew for the failed experiment is sticking with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments are continuing. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But will the Bion Biosatelliten &quot;&quot; are only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space in already. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just the Biosatelliten, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing of the space rats offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproductive directly in space could be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals that are taken from their natural habitat, can simply follow their reproductive driving. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, humans could in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations such experiments are carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women already fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> There was the greatest risk for Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious that owns the humanity, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The gull flew, and no one on earth would be able to answer the following question: Is it the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> Will it bring after this flight a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, no one answered that question,&quot; space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse says. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrijan permissions, was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja gave birth, which was twice in orbit, and even Shakespeare work outside the space vehicle, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, a risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonauts, where everything went after long flights, and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,&quot; concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov quite rightly, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, humanity needs for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Hydro-lab in preparation for the cosmonauts is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in limbo, the cosmonauts routine to win the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is the small Ichtyander, would testify that life in the country rose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the amniotic fluid, and that it may be easier to get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, from birth to pass for the first swimming just two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget about something,&quot; baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa says. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While a newborn child for the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman cannot function without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of weightlessness, the stomach and pelvis muscles is enormously back quickly and thus also decreases the ability to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we do this by birth, a senior aids. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber, squeezing the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; Is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov quite rightly. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> To feel the gravitational pull of earth, the organism can train the skeleton and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child is in orbit, not as an adult to be put into a pressure suit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply that missing, which is vital for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment, which together make, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely unangepassten people bring to the world,&quot; says the director of the bioethics commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, it becomes a reality, however, if the people in their space ships leave to a distant planet, which is the home for the All-born offspring. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ chief: Control of the black-and-system through the fault of the policy fails </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has linked to public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, however, falls in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the interview for this Aktuálně.cz says the vice president of the Supreme Control Office (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly, and I think that this is not the case,&quot; KALA comments on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar outcome is also a joint control by Czech and German auditors is apparently. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of bad practice, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so-called &quot;black-system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would harass the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;But the law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the government chairman is not easy, and the surveillance office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, not in his work,&quot; notes KALA. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries in terms of public contracts were compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> So what was there? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel investigation with which we have started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Put simply, it is important that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts and the national legislation to build and, finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not over yet, we have to observe extremely interesting differences. &quot;Generally speaking, the laws are with us, maybe even a little&quot; strict and perfect, &quot;but the actual application in Germany in some parameters. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Thus, it is not enough to create new and more detailed rules is confirmed, we must also deal with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Whether the project can you help? What do you for this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is such a joint control could help that we cease to strive constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing thresholds, though it has apparently not very positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means to buy something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that we are straining the system in this way only with excessive &quot;paperwork,&quot; and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system when the threshold values remained if higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How the system works in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart is the NKÚ of the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to us and also a college, which is only slightly different, however, in principle, work both authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are these auditors in individual states - that is the German system different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control federal funding, which is in line with our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are managed by us from the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of state auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to the German legislation, which is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would be reluctant to compare with no concrete details. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but you can certainly not say, however, that Germany is considered better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> That is perhaps because the auditors are there better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This is not, however, such comparisons, I may not particularly like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> In this regard, it can be noted that even those countries which are a model for us, are also struggling with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority had the revision of the public procurement law, you already feel any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our controls take place later, one must expect a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> So far, we feel the effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new instrument of control &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and tested with this almost 14,000 public contracts and analyzed, the changes will certainly have an impact, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls have been modified, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with additional bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules are &quot;strict&quot; and could not be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules, a review unterzogenen people are against the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable to the effect that any breach of the public procurement law breaches of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But is it sensible to make the law even tougher? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not to punish those who have committed a formal errors, which affects the real decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out here? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us first of all, what is not targeted. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with control of the so-called &quot;black-system&quot; badgering, what does that mean exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> If the black-system now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A bill must have valid, and if something is illegal, then the government chairman is not easy, and the surveillance office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, not in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We change the law and allow the matter,&quot; but he could not say that we act as if nothing had. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder is ruled out with the best offer alone due to procedural errors. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what is missing here, in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Eisglätte prevails on the streets, but they are mostly dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic snow and Eisglätte is in part. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Most of the roads are passable, well, sometimes increased caution is in order. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karl Bad </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Ornest Šimon: At our concerts, we want to gain positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about that the doomsday is scheduled to take place in less than a month? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those disasters messages that we pounce people so much. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The Tap Tap we care more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to halt the doomsday or prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you realize a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we plan for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end on December 21, at 11: 10 a.m. forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held from 9: 00 p.m. at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be roughly at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, in a time zone 14 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> This idea comes from whom? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally from me, then we have fleshed out the idea, together with our graficdesigner Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> We do not want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the doomsday, but we also want to consider, together with the public on the state of the world we hand over our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags and key supporters against the doomsday developed, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can support us, too. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers also included the so-called anthem against the doomsday titled &quot;doomsday comes from.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. If it is playing to the benefit concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, and provided in the end, that everything is fine and the doomsday is not... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem is to be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the hymns are transmitted together in a direct circuit from the Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem of Tomáš HANÁK, who plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings with Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> As you have come to the cooperation with both? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which has to do with the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try to integrate these people hard in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It was clear that most to cooperate with us are interested, and have fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> The purpose of the proceeds of the concerts benefits against the doomsday? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo where we already six years together with the club in the Tap Jedlička Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly attended by editors who help them in different activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Since the students themselves do not have the means to travel to the editors, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In connection with the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building, in which we will move in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert, several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> On what criteria you have chosen them? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support lesbiens occur Illustratosphere with Dan Gemini, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Learn everything else on the Website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> A similar &quot;big events are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Its overseas plans are not very small, so far, you already have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. Moreover, we must, of course, many instruments, suitcases and other bags waiting... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA On-and British Airways were always prepared very well for us that I have sometimes surprised by some. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through your trips abroad to compare the situation in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities you have and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> As you have seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses that everything is in the East is still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not, where it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is, of course, there is not even that one vorlässt a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are clubs who are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things where we are behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is, however, noted that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities operate independently in the public space, who can use toilets etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the public arena, we are with the band The Tap Tap slightly ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly will strong personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to form a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I started as a manager in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am among musicians and saxophone playing, I, along with a colleague, a music-AG. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, that is, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič laughs, likes to say, things get out of control. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known, but only in recent years, or I am wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us the cooperation with well-known singers; we also have also begun actively campaigning for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We became aware that if one is doing something and see it is not outwardly, has his own performance in a sense. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the EU funding, we can be as good, high-quality equipment and etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Was it your goal to bring it with The Tap Tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I sensed the potential that we can do things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business, one of the other copies today. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical in its own way, as anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long period of time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the viewer has mostly is, of course, have pity; it is only natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned beings that we would regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who can live a full life and develop, provided they have the necessary funds. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that when people with disabilities can do something, not only for themselves is a step forward, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was for this success is also helpful, that you are a strong leader, we hear from many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to do something good, we must make no compromises and in many areas demand also needs a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and once they realise that they have tested twice a week, complete preparation stages and have to spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm among many expires. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> So it works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the beginning, i.e., since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. &quot;People come and go, and that we cannot prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Will take place on the day before the projected doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Venues are: INCHEBA Arena / Prague, Brno and Plynojem Fléda / / Ostrava, Czech bands and other musicians 12 </seg>
<seg id="1192"> All three venues are finally connected via a live circuit and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem &quot;doomsday&quot; comes from the band The Tap Tap. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled education center to show that under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The admission costs 400 CZK, children under 12 years stay free tickets are available in advance in Bohemia Ticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland has been on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of the space agency, Poland is the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008, ESA member was). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency and participated in the following years in several ESA projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before World War II Polish cosmos fans deal with the space, but they were not always understood. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work &quot;entrance to the Space Exploration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) cold left the audience, however, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Šternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the Space Exploration&quot; by Robert Esnault-Pelterie&apos;s and André Louis Hirsch donated Prix REPS-Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the craters was named on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925 was in Poland, a railway trolley, for which a rocket propulsion was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not yet clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the trolley. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the institute Komórka Tech NIKI Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The surviving documents show that the research has got to the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research, however, was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 turned up in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric hunt rocket, and the following year was the work of &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Lotnicza&quot; of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war were all projects for the military use of missile technology from the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work was completed by the start of war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another article on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy, in which four major items of space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the International Federation for space travel, founded in 1951, and indeed, the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, became the first PTA-Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This office he had until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA significantly participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was approximately 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the Bledowska Desert flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another development stage should already be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM 34 should remain at an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of high-altitude winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, the further development has been. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The first missiles of the type RM was in 1962 to 1965 meteor-1 rocket being developed. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length cm amounted to 510 and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> These three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which is the size of the transport area for scientific instruments were different. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1B about 0.34 liters and meteor-1c states about 0.62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude was in all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968, was in the aviation institute the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to a payload of 10 kg, at an altitude of about 60 km to transport. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions of the meteor-2H and Meteor-3 built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee followed. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos program in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miro Law Hermaszewski after the Czech cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on charitable work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> That decision provoked a lively discussion in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason is that the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that comes with rampant financial speculation, hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) a price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept of a state is to understand where the manufacturer is trying to survive by imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition by offering the competition &quot;to grab a larger market share and increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy them cheaply, or give up their business, however, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labor costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for caused by unemployment, the rising government spending needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and replace the society they cause social and economic damage. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of its own population and thus artificially to lure foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly applicable laws in changes. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly due to economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there is a public food distribution points for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people affected is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases in which workers will receive a wage so low that the state must increase their income by the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all the EU&apos;s southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state where the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance on the margins of society and about whom to hope that at some point, private investment capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here, the question naturally arises where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it from another EU country, moves only poverty from one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This affects the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state did not get involved with capital on its own economy, and that planned economy will lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital narrowly insists on its position that the state cannot lenkend into the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then you have to ask whether the private capital not influenced by the politics and the entire state in their own selfish interests or even draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here the clear answer is: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, a legislation, in which everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is so charged that a State Department private lack of finances, densely entwined with industry law firms with the preparation of draft legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills will be passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The violence comes not from the people, as they proclaim the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously, the liberal democracies are currently in a situation like Appian describes it in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeius&apos;: &quot;The state has been understood for a long time in the fall, and the posts were filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Corruption proliferated incontinent, and the people had already bought votes in the election... &quot;&quot; people to speak with character applied for posts, so that the state had eight months as a result of this decline any consul... &quot;&quot; You really began with the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that a strong man to be elected... &quot;Appian is thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is based in today&apos;s society, as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference of his own advantage, not paying attention to societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is by its very nature, not for the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites who are not in the least for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we need to look in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Seen from the current state of the sinking of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a pause in which the next round emerges. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly disastrous the fact that today&apos;s elites in the future, the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have already witnessed today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance towards. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on charitable work here is no solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to drive down the social level of the population down. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore system. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state weaken. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> ... &quot;that nothing comes from violence, or ever Sting fragile could arise in the song&quot; sings, whose main verse reads in the chorus: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When my sons wanted no wars, there would be no,&quot; the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild says in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> While some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians regard as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is a victim; at the end of the current residents were born in Israel, including the self-governing territories in the current political situation and saw the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is that the readers a glimpse behind the scenes to open, view the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East, particularly useful. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based in part to accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can make a Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities itself, which governed their moves autonomously, or whether someone was behind her throne, who drew their actions to a predetermined destination. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not created within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under this astronomical rich families, one stands out particularly that could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know whether someone is above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> A lot of it is not written. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably,. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of its name with high criminal acts, in the background, the consolidation of power, the proliferation of their assets, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all banks in the world, and the countries where they are not involved in the central banks they lead, wars or arm themselves to these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis only four remained, with Russia, meanwhile, has accused the Central Bank of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, its own (read: State) notes issue and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite for the Rothschilds led over the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Masonic of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aim was to eliminate the big royalist states nature of Europe, by the second war, in particular, the colonial rule of Britain should be broken, and the third war aims to reduce the global population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would be for their facilities and their luxury and would not consume so many resources to create a universal religion (the Ecumenical here is nothing more than the apron) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, is triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from chao - order out of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and crises such as those of them in 1907 triggered always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so as not to repeat). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> On them by the assassination of the Hapsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering World War I, they destroyed the Russian empire through the revolution, the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian empire, the war was no longer needed), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to ignite the Second World War, the bankers left by the policy of creating a latent conflict situation in occupied Germany with gigantic war reparations; they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to the Germans, only a sufficiently strong leader among cheer, who named the culprits and simple solutions offered; another factor in the creation of the multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia was with a strong German minority, which should play the role of a fifth column and also took to rekindle the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as at the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There have been terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether it&apos;s massively from the chain that international bankers had initially kept him, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and paved, as well as by the war reparations against Germany in the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If it will succeed the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people during World War II, as a victim in the front line of battle, this time with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (just think how sharp the people into pro- and anti-Israeli divide). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong, just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their aspiration stood at the beginning of a global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> One must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership of the international bankers in Israel, but as with us, the people, only their own candidates for the election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism-prone, international bankers loyal dutiful politician who is doing everything it can to provoke a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly spread to a global conflict, and over the control of Iran, the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, about 20% of the world&apos;s oil supplies run, could lead to a deterioration of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the light of the words of David Rockefellers appear there in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is everything, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip is implanted to subject the essence of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that the little ones and the big, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants are all a malt oak in her right hand to her forehead, or that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt oak, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here, who has brains, who put the number of the animal&apos;s wisdom. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: Call if about the worst, Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> For their release, they demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades has maintained the patronage of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, she was not able to impose in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco everything made in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats have been freed after 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian government had been given. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat against Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo of the film director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that brought the United States a small part of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran to bring, helped them an extravagant story for covering their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly locations in the country for a science-fiction movie. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of the genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The experts for &quot;Exfiltration,&quot; Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The camouflage was credible, seemed to rule on this film project in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, &quot;but also a so-called&quot; Caper Movie, the story of a successful piece (such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table in the office corridors, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck did with this film a remarkable start of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a losing actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO his third feature film is the thriller Gone Baby Gone (no breeze, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film Afflecks, which is not in the home of the director of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that contrasted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story moves somewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck has achieved a similar effect with his team with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with the fact that the story is not really a lot in the cinematic sense exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He works with the little but quite successfully, although he is sometimes a bit of reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis is averted at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway rather memorably). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to show a lot of action in too many places, too. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood employees is very charming, but their characters would have earned more space, and they are in the film is far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film loses a bit of traction. It is a movie that you have some interest in the design and to a thriller reminiscent of the 1970s retro style down. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> He awakens enthusiasm, however difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a day in some way living piece of history and as proof of how excessive are the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for inflating of balloons, bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges proclaims this year has decided that the &quot;most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;This idea of recently put forward by the EU plan brought us, a women&apos;s quota of 40% to introduce in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik nacher, who cares about the organization of this survey, compared with the daily Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice is located on the unification of insurance rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, for the insurance companies because they objectively pose less risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Another incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote will be by the end of February 2013, &quot;nacher informed. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> On the controversial EU regulations of the mandatory admixture of bioethanol for fuel, which is damaging nature in its wake, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because it is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages, this year because of the eggs were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism of the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter&quot; or ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs has earned in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas have to be 14 cm long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU machine often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries are represented as the Czech Republic tries (currently, for example, with veto-threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobby interests were also behind it that banana trade of the highest class in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and no &quot;curvature anomaly&quot; exhibit. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself by arguing that they are merely harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would hinder trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables have softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries already on the grounds that the previous directives to a waste of food would lead. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be accompanied by saying that children under eight years of the balloon without the supervision of an adult would fail. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU, citing an American study, according to balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies for children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious incursions at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd, a directive that European officials themselves subject - everyone who plays in the EU, an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece does not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities laissez on behalf of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member country. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU imposed the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our EU accession in the territory of the Czech Republic was allowed to decide. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, and a large fine threatened us. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for funding. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are put at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will be asking for a refund from the EU, &quot;the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas said in the autumn of 2004 (Abitur). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He gave as an argument that the grain harvest was very high and the state-run camps were overcrowded, as a result of the so-called intervention buying. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> As the Czech Republic took another route to sea ports, according to the palace, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros in us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The European Commission, the Czech Republic, was so far that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for funding provided the municipalities of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, should it be funding for the setup of grant money requests to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations in the Member States is easily the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and therefore deserves more recognition for efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A more serious problem is that experts believe the EU funding for projects that absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but in the budget negotiations have been forced by individual member states. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions also evokes here, the fact that the Czech Republic is similar to other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and fight this battle is not over. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Even so, the Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria called Olomoucké tvarůžky defend &quot;the Inländerrum Tuzemský (rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, we had to rename our manufacturers, however, in&quot; Tuzemák. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products in the EU, of Carlsbad rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the Saazer hops in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> With an EU-brand to the Pardubice gingerbread or Hořicer roles pride. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> &quot;The people want me to save the Republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur, Okamura said. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how do you get the idea to stand for the office of president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not to be me, senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything would work in our country, I would stand anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer find ourselves with the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people&apos;s taxes and the retirement age will be increased. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something I like, then I try to propose a solution to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I&apos;m already over 40, and independent and not belong, I have no other way to influence things to run for senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have succeeded, and then immediately on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> This does not go back on your constituents? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I told myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have clarified it and said that I will be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not only that we as a people ranting in the pub and in front of the TV, but make sure everyone who wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The media are trying to steal one of the honour and lie to confuse the freedom of speech with freedom. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists, or that I was a consultant, Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The battle for the castle you have included with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> So, you need to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen, I have argued that the travel guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, rejected it on purpose, and that is only the population. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party-less, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I can think of no drawers and party dogma of any party to take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Watch as a human being in politics rather right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From Czech perspective, it seems to me that people see me more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this right-left thinking, but completely unimportant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we can make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I would like to connect people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the mutual or by the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It bothers you, if someone calls you as a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But they acknowledge that not by what you have just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you add in a company with a business plan, then you have an ideal target and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you want to approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament only keywords you remain. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And you come in politics in the long term, not far away. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that you, if you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and to try to convince the public that they bring to our side to achieve these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And if the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, highlighting abuses, can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> You only need to look at the direct election of the president, who was due to public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the policy I have only just begun, and try to find my program for the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn&apos;t, then I go back in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a little like Okamura whether the Czech Republic should save. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I can do it alone; that is why I have spoken with several famous people about whether they don&apos;t want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have spoken with Radim Jančura, however, rejected due to overwork. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I also have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported, who discovered the fraud in trading, with light heating oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the eligible voters went to the polls at all, and those who have gone representatives of the establishment, have mostly chosen. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, the direct election of the mayor and district, for example for men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the establishment of a separate party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past have every potential party member, and not the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about financial statements, how would you? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I value my private wealth to about 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> &quot;I have a property with a value of about $25 million to 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu yogurt, which is worth about one million for an apartment, and then I have a few million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a child&apos;s dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in a car, Galanter on women was, and at the same time, fought against the evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive an Aston Martin, a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you don&apos;t want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> That is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already spent 2.5 million into the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program may not have much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will be covered basically through my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senator tight budget, I could not live alone; so I could pay for my son, for example, not the English school that costs 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Only if I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So stay active as entrepreneurs to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you will go back to these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that is not linked with the amount of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have reduced my activities in part. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy managing director of the travel office is in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I still have to live by. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> Which monthly income they were used as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Some 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As president, I would stop my activities, however. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a technician at the roadside. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large operation, says: &quot;But, well, it is already the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All of them have Internet, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is still in one of these old-style libraries, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little visit needy sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80,000-resident community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this stupid circumstance, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general education and emulate the seven fictional bridges displayed on the euro seem to be pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive formation. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers that there is only one way to deal with the statistics, Mr realized: A library to her. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of great bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition-hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And the jury looked nonplussed while still with the armpits and shrugged the cheeky Maas stack, its fine souvenirs of a pyramid and founded aktionistisch ended his speech with the words: &quot;Dear municipality!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeken mountain! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain built up. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> He is part of a revitalization project, which includes an underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the books mountain was awarded the second prize &quot;best library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Moreover, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless small-town retort that had not so far more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white facade, one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, richer for a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But especially Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Books El Dorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift that leads through the mountains, but the real joy of open space and read the town to climb the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker soil and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And books, books, books everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a big, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal lies,&quot; says winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have asked the classic space configuration on its head and gestülpt the reading area from the inside to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the book&apos;s is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environment and technology center. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special pleasure, the black bookshelves, who are facing a wall, sometimes parapet, rose close countries. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel and smell are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even hardcore architects and engineers at the unknown elements offs shake their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work here with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trou Borst, project manager for the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we have encountered in a friesländischen holding one day on a suitable waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, is used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeter thin plastic woven as root. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and time-efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin textile respects, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bulky. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> The library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP (mountain) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little after new cars and a little after athletic footwear. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> According to 105 degrees is arrived at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 meters long wandering in the cafe will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficus trees. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide atmosphere, particularly the right humidity for literature, but in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe, but this house is&quot; despite the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology, Trou Borst says. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the books mountain is under a glass of fall, the sun shines even on sunny days, briefly into the interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad wood glue Binder, who are right on the glass facade serve as shading and catch a large part of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of fully automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry, already dared the way into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> , Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde that boeken mountain Spijkenisses even as &quot;long overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: To open a few weeks ago, everyone residents was invited to donate a book from his personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Thus, the optical gaps should be filled in for the time being, not yet fully-stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is heartwarming. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; architect winy Maas says. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation every residents now has a certain relationship with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only to grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed the king discipline, which are called in the jargon identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> So young and uneducated, they may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is finally a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balances in Berlin on a narrow diplomatic degrees. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then, Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> So why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it also supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also included the voice, when it came to set up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was finally enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues a clear position? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it was just switch his foreign policy and away from a policy that were managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans appear so between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they grope still to their role, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as they have in France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy means because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have had an influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why it needs to be careful to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want to give too much weight, which is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, abstained from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe in Europe and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe Germany will record that even some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests have to be taken into consideration. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Are there any differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite sympathetic to the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But due to the political situation here, the government will be able to take that position publicly, of course not. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so like of Netanyahu&apos;s policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany, it is difficult to reconcile his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> It has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany itself, if you look at the role as a major international players - wants to play a key role in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The leadership or Germany is still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not yet accustomed, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is difficult, the country still to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> For example, if we look at the euro crisis, there is every time Germany assumes a greater role, a variety of anti-German sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That makes it the Germans not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> In this light, Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States declines in European politics, the EU to fill that vacuum at the moment but who else is there? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like it, it makes them uncomfortable, and much more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in the academic research and policy experts from Europe and North America, along with the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he focused on German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Trademark protection&quot; in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani, a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> What Armani Polo is? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind them, a China officially registered designation, which has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, she enjoys protection as long as the actual name donors complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear whether they get right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing says, who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators range a few additional letters, so that they can register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> It is easy for Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada is rather than one Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are legally copied in this way, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name, used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna left there. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are world champions in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Patt hole cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he is opposed to Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; a passenger mark. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is geared to &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> Thus, women are meant that fishing is rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;This is bad for business, you have to fight,&quot; Patt hole. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research firm CLSA China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But deletions of dubious entries in the trade register are difficult to achieve and go into money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years, the procedure may stretch, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Patt hole reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because of the name, objected to &quot;market reality is for the long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff had bad luck, he had to pay even imitated the money because he violated its brand in China, stalemate hole says. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes, the law of the jungle here. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also affect graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker plaster. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese may still use an emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyer Geely was originally a blue-white logo, which reminded of BMW, the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile could look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that it gave in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and equipment shortages. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, but it was returned from the &quot;emergency situation in the workflow to normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure had fallen by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost featuring such cases, we have concluded, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 objections on completion are still in the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> By contrast, it costs a lot to </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, more than 1.4 million applications were received at the CTMO trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record, meant that China come up for the 10th time in a row, the list of featured in all over the world, the authority with shares. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> That holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011, had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> It simply means that any application on average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> By contrast, addressing a multiple costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese copy. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans were able to ensure that the illegal manufacturing imitation motor vehicle parts was mined. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the followers secured the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> But even that failed because surnames in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical heading in Munich said. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich because. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two instances of Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Must be extremely </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could be difficult to quantify, the company archives have even a hundred-year-old acts with regard to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered by the other side in vain for a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; to resolve. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much it is worth to us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, when imitators secure there unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to reverse the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It must be extremely carefully,&quot; Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole to rates of German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners &quot;should register everything that is worth protecting, somehow, even in China,&quot; as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg below deck in the last act of his trademark drama, then we would have to pay royalties for the other side&apos;s own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be forced in the segment in question out of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> AIDS Day: Noise, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In the choral work near Heidelberg imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a relationship that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, there is the possible: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies and gentlemen slippers look sexy on the parquet floor of the clock, find it quickly. </seg>

<seg id="1707"> Then the voices of the singers swelling can occur slowly lobby - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano - You and pursue. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductors, makes it almost from its cloth shoes, even if it with his smooth wild gestures brings together. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir imbongi work near a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> The 50 singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, a human geneticist until Haussmann. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;If &apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and talk about it in a foreign language: Zulu, from 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> For self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Worldwide, there are approximately 34 million HIV-infected, UNAIDS estimates that the program of the United Nations to Bekämfung AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million people live in the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni found the association Voices for Africa patent in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them visit a secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the child&apos;s school fees, a school uniform and a hot meal a day in the Gogo-Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means on Zulu storyteller or Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The Bantu language fluently speak to no one in this room, but sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost ten years, the choir songs a exercises in this strange soft language and brings it every now and then back to where they came from originally: To South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because 733 8 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple less limestone and straw huts, most of whom are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have no parents, because they succumbed to the virus. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni shows on a small scale, and quite Swaziland suffers: The highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Circumcision of male foreskin that reduce the risk of contagion demonstrably by half, will be adopted by the population. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency virus, with mid-30 to die is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, discovered the chorus of the village, but especially saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which not only was a lack of parental care, but simply of everything: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a school in a poor country, there is certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals to send a few euros a year for a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later founded the choir of the association &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; which is almost professionally since the AIDS-orphaned in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes and hepatitis ejaculation. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Lice and itch are among the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the main groups concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany through sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> The heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, dan Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country - but comparatively small: About 20 percent of new infections of HIV in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections among young people are much more common than in other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here, Humane Pappilomaviren also occur among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> As the number of infections has developed? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert-Koch Institute from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011, more than doubled. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections is since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can genital sores, urinary symptoms, discharge, pain and blisters or cause warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> They often cause no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because pathogens can be passed on from sexually transmitted diseases, including through smear infection and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the STI cured and diagnosed with late consequences can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fees, which the choir ersingt throughout Germany, some things come together. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We have already sent a total of about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni,&quot; Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association says. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and strong woman manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also cares about the orphans in good, at one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, as it is called the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and ensure that the children appear to be on time in their uniforms to school every day. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Anyone who has more, comes into the house to protect Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club, as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> It also has a &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; Nähschule launched two chicken houses built and, together with the American Health Organisation PSI organized that many in the village have an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease is so obvious throughout the country, it is silent, they prefer dead. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is&quot; an absolute taboo, Annette Lennartz says, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> In fact, strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life, the HI-virus in recent decades has spread so quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> There were free condoms at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, &quot;but they are hardly used. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our insights into space: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the sportfishing. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been steadily - and the insights they deliver, deeper and deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It makes you look into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner workings of the Gran Canarias Centro on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is hanging in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in the elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its special feature: The high light-gathering power. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is, after all, despite comparatively low mirror diameter - in the world&apos;s largest mirror telescopes. </seg>

<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, you might say, being in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here, the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, not much, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Aserisch and is very durable. </seg>

<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to the tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was in May with the Eurovision song festival famous - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documented from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years ago, a child conceived </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum of the shepherd Şirali Müslümov is to have become 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is a birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 here in the region, in 1973, he died,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man had been married three times and had 23 children, aged 136 years ago, he is said to have fathered a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> A Şirali Müslümov has billed his age by a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But even Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, the elderly in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;There are a lot of striking hochaltrige people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;also in Sardinia live very many very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to a lack of documentation was, however, no scientific evidence to bring about the age, marital status register lacked. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, melted butter cups </seg>
<seg id="1908"> The fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking reach a Biblical age, however. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why are so many high elderly live here in the south? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the specific genes of Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum Director Fatulayeva, believes that it is up to the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But it is the high-calorie diet of Talyschen should be as healthy, love the meat, bread and milk products, and drink a glass of every day, many of whom melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view, not just plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps young people in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years for these latitudes, it is still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the floor with a butter barrels, which they move tirelessly and herrollt. </seg>

<seg id="1919"> Two young children are jumping. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen prepares one at home, in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu-glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly to under her headscarf, she hides long, dark blond braids that reveals her son proudly in front of us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I washed my hair with milk, so they were never me and retained their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; Mirzayeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough to </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has only ever eaten that what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev,&quot; Aliyew took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> By 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no need for Azerbaijan&apos;s elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva, for local conditions, an amount that it is possible to live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps Mirzayevas long gray son is correct: &quot;The elderly in our culture of respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved and cared for, are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is missing in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>

<seg id="1943"> We need to create the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And that he will succeed is in my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all people, but especially well to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because they all hopelessly divided thus far in a confused opposition, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> He had, Mohammed Morsi said almost entschuldigend, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and its powers expanded, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what of the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, as are the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary should be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Indeed, the 234 articles from the Islamist-dominated the 100-member constituent assembly in one night, 15-hour Parforceritt were pushed through, some worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the case law based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is called &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will take advantage of the vague wording and related legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least a new article conducted near: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-Ashar upon University, the main Islamic institution in the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary as a result. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should remain intact. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These dishes served during Mubarak&apos;s rule on the repression of political opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator of up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state should also, as it is in the draft, &quot;protect the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and promote their morals and values. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is legally so unclear that state institutions control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> For another bans, the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to insult or slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Similarly, the phrase seems dubious, &quot;insulting people is prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Already a caricature of the president or a joke there will at the expense of a Leader? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft, before Morsi to sign and after his words &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition formed for weeks against the power of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed that the Charter to fail before they can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned, and we will prevail,&quot; said Sabbahi lean, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft constitution &quot;belong on the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via short messaging service Twitter, he accused supporters of Morsi&apos;s desire to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and&quot; him, the opposition Jasser Said said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers are not punished,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the counter-demonstration, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Bank of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi attended and shouting: &quot;The people calling for the application of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded that Morsi: &quot;Don the country!&quot; And protested: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, probably would have provoked civil war-like situation. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> That obviously wanted to risk Morsi&apos;s supporters. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box, in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> A majority of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The word&quot; human rights is not even </seg>

<seg id="1990"> The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they sat in jail under Mubarak or in court. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Because he would not share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> This, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the word is not even human rights in the new constitution,&quot; he laments in conversation with the &quot;world on Sunday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi&apos;s extension to all three powers in the state were forecast, the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president put them de facto repeal,&quot; laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> But without civil society organisations a democracy could not work. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which sees the ideological direction fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>

<seg id="2011"> When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegian flows into a celebration here at Fagernes, which this is, well, really very impressive speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;We eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Harvard Halvarsen that actually works in the local fire station, but, as a &quot;general&quot; the Rakfisk festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;People like the Mansche from more than the Rakfisk,&quot; Harvard said. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The spirit can oust the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I eat a few bites. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it fails to bring the Rakfisk in nasal proximity, he is not a bad thing, such as sushi, which has quite a long bus ride. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling capacity and soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and, no doubt using alcohol consumed in subdued senses. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to find work to leave their country and immigrated mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who was not so long ago, much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly fragrant part of the Norwegian history. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> He is one of the more expensive meals, which you can buy here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything here is really expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs as much as 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often in the world press, and most people seem to disrupt it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here you hate them still to mention by name - Anders Breivik shot the racist right-wing extremists, who last year, 77 men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it focuses only on the &quot;incident on 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegian find it hard to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main responsibility for today&apos;s wealth of Norway&apos;s growth since the early 1970s, one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are so good,&quot; Anna, our waitress says that round tablets distributed with mature Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are, as they say - a prudent people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Her English is like that of the majority of people here are spotless. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not very declaring, we do not like bragging. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested for the benefit of future generations into a special fund. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When all cast in the years before the Great Depression with money around, which they had not, Norway held his wallet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we go in winter, skiing and hiking can go in the summer, we are&quot; happy, Anna says. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And, of course, eat Rakfisk,&quot; she adds with easy laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand in the snow and another court to ask me for - from Rakfisk I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> As a moose-burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat told me. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But on the evening of the Stinkefisch is back on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I stayed, is one of several venues that organize the Rakfisk-dinner, where guests in the best sense of smell - or perhaps the most challenging - fish vote. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live TV circuit with a fly-clad presenters, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What did you score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Our points, Harvard are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Are sharing and laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico&apos;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC&apos;s Will Grant analyses of the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently, the traffic in Mexico City particularly badly. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which has sealed off several important transport routes into the capital and on the roads for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president connective and take over the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons Mexico has become economically well off, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost over the past six years already 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence,&quot; said Pena Nieto earlier this week in the Oval Office, the US President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before with the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, one remembers, for example, to him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents of the resort to credit him with the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto, who represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that were once here. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> With his name badges outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally 9th Gabriel Hernandez, who as Congressman Nietos Pena&apos;s party, the PRI works. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Member of Congress, 9th admits that the party is after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The allegations by the opposition, the new president&apos;s lack of substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, above all, but he is also someone who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Tlacopan, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could be on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo, not bigger. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under highway bridges and, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs operating in those areas, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a corner fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies were alone in the last two years left stele murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that is itself the city of Ciudad Juarez exceeds that for their violence and the notorious killings of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has addressed the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not adequately. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But, in the worst case, his government have closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete, typical of the derelict district, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me pictures of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if her body had been washed,&quot; recalls Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the bodies had already been fixed. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down from the wall. It is placed next to a cross, which bears a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But exactly this, so the family, you have denied her until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me when I was a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> You want to accept their verdict simply and shut up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that is not possible, if so many flaws and omissions were there,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday, the president of binding, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to care during his tenure, especially around this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president, he is as he was as a governor,&quot; said the PRI-Congressman 9th in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But, just before the families of the victims in Ciudad neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The prosecution claimed that Bradley Manning have complained about mistreatment </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutor goes against Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The hearing deals with the Mannings time in the military prison in Quan, Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense is seeking a dismissal of the indictment because too harsh prison conditions </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The pride of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecutor&apos;s office has tried to note that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information of American history - several occasions failed, over his alleged mistreatment suffered in military custody to complain. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination Mannings a procedural hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein during that documents to weekly visits to the prison officers Mannings during nine months of prison time had made in Quan, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the indictment, Manning had been punished by the harsh prison time already sufficient - Manning had testified that he had considered the suicide in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The intelligence analyst for the US Army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of, while serving in Iraq to have stolen thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has Manning confirmed as a source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning the forms by which officials after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quan tico-filled in military prison, where he from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced prison conditions for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein questioned him on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that it is an excellent treatment by his guards as &quot;&quot; and assessed the treatment by the establishment as a whole as &quot;very professional&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, so thin, no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials Manning had consulted directly on his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials have discussed it with him and to deal with them, however, had been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (after meeting the concerns)&quot; No problem, &quot;and that meant not necessarily that I said nothing,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he complained about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the from him a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicide thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade its observation status to &quot;prevention of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is a step below the suicide risk, and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to convince people that it was good, and get rid of the observer status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life, from my point of view,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> From Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison at the naval base Quan tico in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that in Kuwait, he had considered suicide and was due to the heat even unconscious. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not to know what was happening to him, or in the outside world, was wearing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell at Camp Arafjon,&quot; to this cage, Manning said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was moved to Quan, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> It took him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to stay on the move, since the day it was forbidden to sleep or lie down. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He had always have to sleep with a light that moved from outside into his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If he had turned up at night and see his face guards could no longer, we have awakened him, so he is back again. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011, Mannings lawyer raised a formal objection to the Mannings treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, as he had the night naked in his cell in Quan tico sleep and stand at a morning counting naked in front of guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had never during this counting the opportunity to encase themselves with its ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> In the survey on Friday, Manning has said that it will have a command of his guard concluded that he should drop the ceiling with which he would have to cover, he admitted, however, that no one had asked him to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced into the previous night to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an official that he did not constitute a danger to themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> The official said Manning was that he would have the federal government of his underwear or his flip-flops can use to get themselves to hurt, but not done. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> On this night, Manning said, were his underwear, flip-flops and glasses have been removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope the judge will take account of his prison experiences at least and drastically reduce his detention standards, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has indicated that Manning will commit minor offenses guilty of other charges, which are considered too extreme, while should be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecutor&apos;s office is a justification of the prison conditions expected. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all among the highest safety precautions in Quan tico Deutsche prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges against Manning, the benefits of the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people were forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was at the passport control arrived when confusion in me. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: One for &quot;Wochos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Foreigners with&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain, to which I should like to travel. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California and was called all my life, &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic symbol - just like my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York, &quot;Italian&quot; name. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I decided for &quot;Mexican-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But it was here in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Foreigners with. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues that are expected if the heads of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with just as likely in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc after the model of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against Mexico&apos;s drug cartels, even though he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the leadership of the country forced under the gun stores, leaving them more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event to overlook. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Once a US government official even mildly critical of Mexico, one hears in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the Montezumas children go on the war path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Yet the greatest challenge lies in Mexico&apos;s truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers, people that the country offers opportunities, and other costs, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or parents - commanded large part got no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, was that person. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we have perhaps now living the American dream, visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that we have many members of the Mexican ruling class not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Their view, our existence is a symbol of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not see us now trapped behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child immigrants legally in the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tension because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are, and Mexican Americans take them so badly. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While American citizen, she sees itself as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans that I know, feel that neither the first nor to belong to another country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> I should learn during my trip, there is one thing that makes this relationship more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie want to resume their ties to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> You want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Should we tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders to step up their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Well now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many feelings hurt. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the unjust distribution of income, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you have to alone, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> That is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico before a century and a half, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans bear a grudge for how their family members were treated just not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm,. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are Mexican, &quot;than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can there be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events such a hope seems to nip in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual blame countless buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time rockets from Gaza are taken near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally find their end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is neither lost nor gained </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems appropriate anything but. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire holds on 21 November agreed that this week&apos;s struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had to record major losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desperate and densely populated corners of the planet spent together, it is Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, gains Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and rich friends can draw on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a revival of regional power that was once seen as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent forms - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style Stürzung Bashar Assad&apos;s regime before it could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the largest population and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt 2011 until his overthrow 30 years, had left little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Brotherhood is verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders even more dependent on people&apos;s views. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be a player who can be excluded even from Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas is not a threat. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defence system, &quot;Iron Dome,&quot; has been able to work, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep peacefully. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remained, not least thanks to the security wall in the West Bank, and thus the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state will be that protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, but still further. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is good. His Likud Party is ahead of the elections on January 22, led by Avigdor Lieberman still struggles with a previous group allied RISC. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why is this nanny behind cunning Palestinians and handed them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they had, in fact, control of the West Bank, they would not like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, including firing missiles? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep and punish them behind the wall in chess, they should dare to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will be able to win, but the Arab spring could make them a dash through the bill. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries in power have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments hardly in the overhaul of its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The fact that the pragmatic President Morsi teamed with Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israelis should think long-term. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic tribute. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a nudge from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The right answer to those who are from the more sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: Two states, Israel granted for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The - for the near future, the hope is that the cease-fire outside grants more influence to enforce this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now work with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of arms to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem to convince. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama needs to do its share to persuade Israel to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems that he would be as a reluctant participation. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws for single cigarette packaging come into force </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, brands, logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, olive green cap, which are printed with graphic images that show diseased body parts and cigarette smoke sick infants and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font is from next Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> Thus, the world&apos;s most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging introduces Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking will be eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> At the same time, the government is based on studies that have shown that people who started with 26 not to smoke, with 99% probability after not starting anymore. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see in children younger age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to promote their brand image,&quot; Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It was said that with the laws of the black market trade would benefit, which lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The laws are too serious, unintended consequences,&quot; Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia says. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand has increased after cigarette holders and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging tremendously since the corporations, British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the top Australian court with their appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have sold up to 6,000 units at wholesalers and waiting for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the hook is the popularity of social media in exactly the group to which the plan is based. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws has tobacco companies from the TV advertising is banned, it prohibits them, acting as sponsors, and most traders forced, cigarettes in shops no longer to be interpreted, and now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and pages, but it has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Whoever has marketed tobacco and left only a small area to promote its products, so the Internet isn&apos;t,&quot; Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care says at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noticed an increase in reports about brands that have been written by &quot;ordinary people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2282"> You have to ask the question: Is this just a private person, so much pleasure to Marlboro cigarettes finds that she is even a video resumes - or has a marketing agency to do? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry concentrate instead on marketing to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> She has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries has increased trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government has held talks with other countries are considering similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada was the first country to give his photographic warnings. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Meanwhile, they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers defiantly show. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You simply take a stake and is&quot; the box away, Victor El hage says when buying a pack of cigarettes on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, &quot;King of the pack&quot; in downtown Sydney, says the single packaging have hampered the filling its shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;In the past I have used an hour to sort it a delivery, now I need four,&quot; Yu said. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should simply ban cigarettes entirely - then we would have told us okay, that&apos;s it, we are close,&quot; he adds visibly aggrieved. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored! </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving unexpectedly, I spent five hours in the airport, when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But a growing number of academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> When it comes to them, it is, for us and our children okay - to be bored at times. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Thus, the brain is forced to lose themselves in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us stare nowadays almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom benefit us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Should we welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of &quot;boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) that is not so. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom&quot; has a very long history, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls beaches like those adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom is there. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many species have been identified and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, &quot;to exert a satisfactory work can be, but not to be able to define it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Thus boredom differs from apathy to the effect that the person is not working, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The apathy, however, there is no urge to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a &quot;disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can sound almost like depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two states could be in context, bored people see the problem in their area, or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in terms of Attention&quot; - earlier: &quot;The idle minds: The definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, &quot;Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment where participants listened to a tape in which a person was read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard this noise. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard the barely audible television, said they would feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for them and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task of the disruption of the attention, can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, if you put a dreary activity - &quot;as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt can distract music and help to feel not bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by people remain physically more attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will eventually dull - my delayed flight, a roaring speakers, a particularly ermüdender film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people get bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a &quot;vulnerability&quot; scale for long while. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale statements such as &quot;many things I have to do, are monotonously repeated and found&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are in a pretty tough bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored in school and doing the homework, while 23% said to be bored when they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> However, only 3 percent of parents said they would feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson says later today, 21 years, he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He was, however, confident that the youth &quot;is perceived as a particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: Boredom is healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes, as in extreme cases, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drug-addicted to relieve them, studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are examining the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researches the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what you should just do best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is boring and you use that energy to play and to cook, you will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television may provide for happiness in the short term, but in the long term they evaporate. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Anyone who reaches his bored child an iPad can distract it from the boredom. It has learned not to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;Self-control transfers from one situation to another.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not just to talk, but also in other areas, more self-control. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Also, we should not see too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to can&apos;t us off the constant activity and technology drip. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds as if we should be more boring, but the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful is boredom,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that people are looking for in truth, only for a way to unwind and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly stimulates, it is hard to deal with the noise is silent again.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice in this state will soon be legal: The possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe with which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said that he and some friends were in a car with it in Lamar, near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police found marijuana in the car had been Orozco for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, summoned excusable peccadilloes, each with a penalty of $100 are provided - and received a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco said. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalise the answer in hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less by the law than from the site. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures have already been dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession on a small scale, which is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offences and pursue quote people still in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities vote, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so rapidly that it is hard to know what will happen next,&quot; Daniel J. door, the police chief in Aurora says that lies east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in the state of Washington scratch perplex me on the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that Colorado is in any case, most states ahead of what the regulation of marijuana subject, where the drug was only for medical purposes and then legalized for personal consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is therefore good for guidance,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Insurance spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith admits that there is no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, which we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and is thus the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the legalized possession. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practice issues need to be resolved at this time - about how the government target of a &quot;reasonable access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere, it will be difficult to find a location for licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal says cannabis, &quot;a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November Chief door sent its employees in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would be minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years no longer track, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; no prosecutions for such offences will strive for. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief door added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for regulation of growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to be persecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he stated that his administration would pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to consumers to the withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people need to be in possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana successfully prosecuted, although many have been prosecuted for other crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our agency has a duty to pursue violations, where it was the obligation of crimes,&quot; Buck said, in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country, shows the possession of small quantities of adults no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also decided to drop all outstanding possession proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think I&apos;m wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changed,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was already clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions in the whole state fostered among local officials a profound dilemma regarding the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> District prosecutors when it was &quot;a&quot; cultural barrier, Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver said, for marijuana offences representing the defendants in court and on the ground, a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws for acts. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have had such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for criminal that they can accept the legalization,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states, the small amounts of marijuana like alcohol treatment, Colorado and Washington as a national sample cases are traded for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervous on instructions from the federal government, which wants to sell and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level, continues to be treated as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department is backing down. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite the arrests of several special medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states largely. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators have no doors are likely to occur in small quantities of drugs for seizures, but is likely to be reluctant, under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado are not only that the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though it only opened in about a year ago. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the West decided to a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to get into a position where we license someone at the federal level, and then face a major problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the change in the law. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We have done this, for what the community has decided not to follow, which has opted for the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many questions remain. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petro nella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not only university students of today are attacked for their views. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once held for the largest temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the major pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance promoted. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history - I had packed up my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said that I would be gone, because I had a problem with fellow students have had sex in neighbouring rooms. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author of A N Wilson said rogue, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth, however, was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> They had harassed me for one reason only - a reason that appeared in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: My late father since Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students from the center-right suffers from a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same protection of equality, gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2432"> In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I was in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher, a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would have even wake up Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the first semester-week, new students and tutors come to know, I received a taste of the future events. </seg>

<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that they take in your spare time a few French hours - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities,&quot; to her like Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room with hanging head back. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> On that evening, I sat alone in college at the dinner, when someone typed me slightly on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is how it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is being harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the Tory first semester, supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub, I later tried to block me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I was not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove to be unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in philosophy, politics and economics, who had visited, ironically, the force as a conservative Richard College, said to me: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>

<seg id="2465"> I felt as homosexuals have had before the more liberal legislation have felt like the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever be able to lead at Oxford University a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would like-minded meeting only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> If I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations to suppress? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that lay before me, spread in front of my mind into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, who announced himself openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only hated for it to be a conservative, but also because he advise Thatcher in terms of foreign policy, and they had written speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in taken were accepted all political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires. </seg>

<seg id="2485"> I am sure that you just pouty. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break the heart, if you gingst. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had the pressure to tamper with his convictions unholy. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another history tutor had claimed seriously, I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Although I secretly zerging in shame, I was, too, that my parents had to undergo a &quot;brainwashing&quot; and called them &quot;old idiot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The relief lasted only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford&apos;s career. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was closed. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes of my Häscher tasks. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me a startling wines repeated. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-old should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory prime minister produced, but still behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human work animals from Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they over 70 kilos of sulphur in the steep, rocky paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work the hell, and others are literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by catching up sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He needs to rise every day, down on the floor of the crater, where the earth from the burned sulphurous gas in contact with the air itself. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Now that he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the downhill path of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they have to keep the balance and put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> You know that each step can cost their lives, as they have done, a French tourist who plummeted years ago to the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Above all, they are on the road between the tourists that they take pictures like circus monkeys and run at the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, which has set up a mining company a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The company PT Candi Ngrimbi who exploit said since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and its workers is never better), which she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and used in the manufacture of baking bread, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive for each way around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros),&quot; said Anto, which is usually three flights a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> For each route he takes three hours, after which he is completely done, at the end of the day, but then he has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but would be three times what he earned with the field work. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to be paid on the day, and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167), is very high,&quot; the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> He earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that Indonesia is as important as the sulphur: &quot;I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and his eyes are often coughing fit wanted because of the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27-year-old Anto since three years of his life on the line at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur left him at the first mark, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and his eyes are often coughing fit wanted because of the toxic gases from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work here two years, because I open a shop or Spanish or French want to learn,&quot; he promises in a more than decent English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This friendly and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could work as a tourist guide, waiters or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and every morning at 2 p.m., because the sulphur vapor and even at night, with its distinctive yellow color in the darkness shines bluish. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 carrier download on the crater floor the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not reduce the sulphur mechanized to save costs, and the agencies that are working on their own account and paid for by weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature park, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to take photographs of the volcano and human animals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals and not humans&quot; Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old vehicle, which operates three decades since leaving the school on Kawah Ijen protested. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, &quot;as long as it is&quot; because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not going to retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulfur burns the eyes and throat itch, if the wind suddenly einklemmt turns and the miners in the thick pillars, rising from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the normal breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, back from the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> With the basket on his back with his 53 years Unainik is only able to take 50 kg. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his companions 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which has three trucks break a goat path between the bush to the camp in Taman Ari are transported in 18 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I am not going to retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life,&quot; explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth, where some teeth are missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur-carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The time passes, but the mediocrity keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: Those who work as human cargo el on Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The blame for this Singapurer that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children&apos;s education. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you&apos;re my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civic duty and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rapper&apos;s songs, which local slogans such as &quot;pushing a&quot; (Netherlands) loaf in the oven, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, who shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to raise awareness of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to perform their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and witty. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> When it comes to reproduce, we are the worst performer in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings (quick flirt). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought: Why do we not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Anyone who takes this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year, it&apos;s $1,300 for political measures to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for married couples and parents paid up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax advantages. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, which is also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why the Singapurer not get more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policies of the national population authority, says that it was a &quot;better training&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed people to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities have contributed to the higher number of people living alone and delay marriage and birth, the result is reducing the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, led an immigration policy aimed at a sharp rise in immigration to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are web sites where the barely concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants to be criticized, especially against the Chinese, who, for keeping wages low and integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers. </seg>

<seg id="2632"> This means that they are for our cash flow is much better. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He admits, however, that the new standards developers give clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>

<seg id="2663"> Even if someone empfähle him a stranger, he would ignore it. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Afterwards, he outlined a series of steps to configure a user account. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge this boy photos of friends would upload awkward or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or I will let him in. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this is cyber-bullying,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people to move, it must be understood that the purpose of the social networks to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in teaching at Yale University and author of the book &quot;Digital Natives and Immigrants&quot; these concepts to explain the phenomenon has evolved. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants, they should teach, where we learn even more,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that this is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria about what is, or should be, and that in an age where the maturity is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy to ask them questions that brings them food for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell you, they should not do it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras calls some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. &quot;Why do you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like it, when it published a photo of you, as it was released from a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know what the others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Have you asked for permission before the other people, if you have labelled photos of celebrations? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another question: Must all know what you&apos;re doing at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring of </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professors, primary school teachers and educational consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the directives of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age, or what you share, or he would publish&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the Guardia, the children must be the lesson &quot;Thou shalt not speak to strangers,&quot; recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru, without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and, in theory, be signed by the seven present rulers. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EF tried repeatedly to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth Annual Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the state and presidential office told initially that they would pass the exam, said later, however, that it would be published at a certain time on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> For questions to the text, they said that the content was set out by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists&apos; access to information about the summit was limited at any time. </seg>

<seg id="2709"> The few information floating around among the journalists, were received by the press, some of the speakers at the meeting of the governments of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document, which was widespread during the day, was the list of participating presidents, which caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> After the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala was not the official document at the end of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, host of the Third Summit South America - Arab states (ASPA) was Peru, and on this occasion, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced despite emphatic call by the press, nor published. </seg>

<seg id="2717"> &quot;We are the ruling on&quot; the differences that we put forward at the International Court of Justice, respect and implement, Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was, is and remains a country that abides by the international law, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submit themselves to the international courts,&quot; and gave Humala announcement deals with a handshake before the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ, came after Colombia had made a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, who considered it a serious mistake, action against the agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to abide by the decisions of the International Court of Justice. </seg>

<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe, the economic consolidation (in Latin America), no triumphant trains, but will serve to increase our production capacity and a better future for our peoples, &quot;added Humala me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give a series of 31 emblematic projects, which are intended to improve the spatial relationships in South America, and particularly in rural and border areas... and unite our countries and develop new forms of exploitation,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, including five Peruvian who were on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should make for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process is used in this country for its resumption of the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America will continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations remains, was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in a regional meeting that he expected on Saturday in Mexico for a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat respectfully the maritime conflict after a question of Bogota in the judgment of the ICJ. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I will&quot; me tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega, Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all of these routes - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua are necessary,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega, that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention, at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, to be present. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc to the adoption of the action plan for 2013, the dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region should be strengthened also met in advance. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; said Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the 6th summit meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that Europeans were killing &quot;in the Second World War and other conflicts&quot; and &quot;today are virtually a fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, push the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;Must be achieved, the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The president of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries, and to take account of those who signed the agreement of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who teach undertake, never too little, and in return for signing the South Americans everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, is based in Washington and financed by the United States,&quot; he said, a reference to the political asylum, Ecuador has granted the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he regretted that decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights was&quot; fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that there were &quot;reasonable suspicions at the time that he would be extradited to a third country and met his procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized the Swedish justice who have asked him to subject him to an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sex crime, &quot;while the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference that can be said about the Embassy of Ecuador in London had.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Since he is in our message is, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador told me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lung, but no serious,&quot; the head of state said Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger that physical and mental damage he did because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors, however, could carry out there. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That the health of every human being would&quot; damage, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of an open letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it would be in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities, Europe&apos;s, and he emphasized that it made with the London talks to find a solution for the captive founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, that word we apply in this case, there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a set of procedures at various European authorities,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain gives carte blanche this morning, in my opinion, it&apos;s done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr Assange interrogated at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, such as the Swedish case law has made it possible, and in other cases, the problem was resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to confirm themselves as defenders of freedom of the press and said that what he will not tolerate that, &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that weaken the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who aspire to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador &quot;no longer by such journalists and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewer bourgeois countries,&quot; and anticipated that he will deepen during a re-election, &quot;the revolution to continue on the path in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the body needs to &quot;stand firm and will be no opportunism and not as a legal-pannelled coup must&quot; because the legitimacy of democracy &quot;was destroyed in Paraguay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which announced before the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime boundaries between the two countries &quot;for absolutely right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At present, this verdict is not implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South and Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> You have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that they can be overcome and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that it is &quot;for Latin America right to call international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if he could lose the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the faith that I was the one guaranteed the probable victory, so I must assume this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, then I retreat from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies if we lose. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. &quot;He told me that he was bombed for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected after the election campaign that he might go back to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It does not necessarily mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader took part in Lima today at the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> A cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb hit,&quot; he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried to weaken without apparent success. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to care only about his illness and began to gather information about it; and that with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s, it was hard to imagine, as there are many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even then, the director of a clinic of the IMSS to adopt a marriage, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, many people in the hospital, who know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already caused damage to their immune system and exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections are still to come. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, means &quot;the great success today that the survival of a patient, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April of this year from a respected scientific publication had been backed up. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> An expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system, attached to the people at the beginning of the treatment, and greater opportunities for those who are dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Put simply, mean the above that, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, &quot;can be easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to view this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today stands at an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality in recent years has decreased significantly (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has reduced of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011, the annual report (yes), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected since the release of the patients have died of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco 2011 255 people died in the year, and until May of this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, be assured that there are since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why do people die so still in it? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drug. The problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they know their infection status, namely in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a telling statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a secondary infection. In order to influence the global mortality earlier diagnoses are needed, and therefore must be offered to all people, where necessary, massive screening tests.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2814"> Between the health programs and the simple citizens large holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the specific places, &quot;the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were made separately, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The risk of people for new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need it?&quot; Is a question of widespread derision by social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health care system that are exposed to young people, the correspondent said. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to orient these inefficient distribution; the condoms should be not just behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions that are frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted the promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It should be paid for them, not the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether it would be distributed under his administration condoms. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality is not; it best to get the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>

<seg id="2824"> It&apos;s 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is in fourth place nationally in terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases and in 13th place in relation to HIV. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that it is the main method of trade with Mexico in bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures for companies with cross-country profile is not known. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the unification of international trade law, the American Law Institute, was used as a peacemaker. </seg>

<seg id="2836"> However, that possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, it is not the first case where this scheme was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by a company of the group from the Instituto Federal de National mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Conn courses). </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is true that after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, which in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, a majority would have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The outcome of the vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent. </seg>

<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of Los Angeles as the country&apos;s &quot;Héctor&quot; Hetin Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years part of this sport, whether as a player of lower classes, players in the first national league, agent and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;My whole life I have many hats,&quot; set up in basketball, even more at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, CEO and president of the Association of the national team in the 1990s, Reyes recalled during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes exaggerates with this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of almost all of his long career and prove it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The heart Bayamón </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he and his 15-year-old anniversary as manager of the club or has celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;That was my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967, as managing director, has or be allowed to coach. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were a lot of rewarding years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy with BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good manager, &quot;Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I know that I am Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a very strong and 2-foot-tall player. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want him? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico had ever. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow recommended on the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best.... and suspension. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for further care. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> With the championship of the Vaqueros Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already in 1988 at the top of the association. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> After the World Cup in 1990, when it occupied the fourth place, which ought to be bronze, if this would not have been Canadian referee, who had to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This group of the World Cup in 1990, was the best national team that you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream Team. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> My favorite, the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won the team gold and offered the United States a fight is, however, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz) were not only back, but also the young players (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote&quot; Morales, who was in 1990 because of a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and gave us great joy was vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in woodlands, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> It was without doubt Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The boy, the work of Leo Arill like me well. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you believe is the best thing you&apos;ve achieved in the association? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s until 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What remains to be done unto you? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The guys that play in Ponce, for example, only in their field and meet only in the national game on teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the children are unnecessary many trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, table-officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am proud of. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What you do today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and now and then I go to a basketball game. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of the television network CBS on the Ewing clan and other figures in the area was from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who shot J.R. on?&quot; That expectation should create an episode full of emotion, where the figure of Hagmann was killed almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were being wagered in betting houses. </seg>

<seg id="2940"> Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: A devious businessman and untreuer husband who sought to leave his sick wife Sue Ellen alcohol (Linda Gray coach). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what is supposed to be on the tombstone of J.R.,&quot; Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should read &quot;here the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing rests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only business that he has not won. </seg>

<seg id="2945"> He is an admirer of millions around the world and irreplaceable and leaves us who had the fortune to know him and to love in our hearts. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; aired a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was shot, told the station. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series. </seg>

<seg id="2956"> After the liver transplant he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to help frightened patients. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them if their operations&quot; before and after that, he declared in 1996. </seg>

<seg id="2960"> The start of the course, which studied the &quot;end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Every week, the students are studying apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Each semester, if the religion professor decided on a course to the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;long count backwards&quot; in the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it meant the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the next two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called &quot;Deudarmaggedon,&quot; as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that it ever was,&quot; said Charmé this week, students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If someone analyses of what happened in the world today than we were 30 days away from, this would be a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history lessons about the &quot;end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple of beisitzende Professor Barry vacker gives the course &quot;media, culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, the students are studying apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why these ideas spread over time,&quot; he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios are offered, which lead to a specific human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students analyzed films with apokalyptischem content and studied how they could compare themselves compared with real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform students about what possible, probably, credible and impossible,&quot; says vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple title &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We are not in 2012, so that we retain the option to be able to hold the course, in the event that the world&quot; will not go under, Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;impending doom&quot; students need to study, create projects and participate in audits. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> Penn State in the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, so the students have no other chance to continue working as a &quot;until the night, where the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were very popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;In two hours, there were no seats,&quot; Restall said of his course for students with a high average, which filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> For weeks before the semester beginning we received e-mails from students who asked whether there were free seats. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, in turn, guarantee that the course is one of the interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It&apos;s fascinating to see what people are doing in order to console themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from age, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or its absence. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains all the apocalyptic movies to have seen. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I have never heard of a classroom, where it is taught,&quot; he stated. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy it. </seg>
