<seg id="62"> Such special support are not set for a long time so storks chose columns of power lines - bound industries rely on wires thanks to what the aistiny settle costs reliably. </seg>

<seg id="152"> It had intervened with the police investigation as hard as you can allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Mr. Ditta did not honour their profession, and disgraced it. </seg>

<seg id="166"> Producers of jets are at war on seat width, when on the game large orders </seg>
<seg id="167"> Among the leading manufacturers of planes fierce dispute regarding the width of the seats of a tourist-class on long-range missions erupted, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute is fostering round the width of the seats, provided on long-haul flights to passengers of the economy class, whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the statements about the effectiveness of the last aircraft proposed Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for the implementation of the industry standard that would provide a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in salons of economy class, but her main American competitor to Boeing said that airlines must solve it. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The dispute goes when aircraft manufacturers compete on sales of more and more large versions of the twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and on the effects potentially record orders are expected from 17 to 21 November. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Configuration of the rear of the plane — especially whether 9 or 10 people in a row sit — is central to the alleged economic efficiency of new projects &quot;mini-airbuses&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accomodate 20,687 people based on seats in economy class more than 17 inch in width posted on 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy class of 350 people on the seats 18 inches wide rowed on 9. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Giants in aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical issues through advertising in the professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> And now Airbus addresses directly to the public before an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It did recently as may be the beginning of new advertising war, demonstrating to financiers a slide from three people in the restaurant next to each other under the name &quot;would You agree to it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> &quot;Boeing proposals long-haul flights on seats of narrower than at the regional turboprop aircraft&quot; — head of the sales of Airbus John Leahy said. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With changing diets people gain weight, but plane seats dramatically has not changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Among the early 1970s when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards of modern distant travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the Department of Health of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The grasp of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the health service of the US. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus claims that her competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s when the average grasp of the waist of those who were named by &quot;jet public&quot; recently, was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus said that commissioned a study showing that the additional inch in width of the seat improves the quality of sleep for 53 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing challenges Airbus figures by the size of seats and said that producers should not interfere with decisions on how to airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> According to her, studies show that ease of salon depends not only on seat width. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It&apos;s actually is limited to providing to airlines choice and the ability to do that in their view they should make for success&quot; — an expert from Boeing in salons Kent Kreyver said. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want that we decided to them, which will do for them profit. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For passengers, the issue is to increase in space on each side, but for suppliers, they tend to be a factor that may affect the profits. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Behind this dispute there is a race for orders for aircraft evaluated on at least $700 billion at the catalogue prices in the coming decades — there is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As for the first reported in July, Reuters news agency, the location of seats — him that stirs up rivalry in the fight between the latest jets. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing declare 20 per cent increase in profitability in one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models in comparison with the market leader in this segment, 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The alleged characteristics of Boeing are partly based on comparison of 10-seater ranks 777X with original 9-seater configuration of ranks a constructive solution 777. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The prize in specific prime cost declines when compared with 10-seater configuration, currently in use. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason why Boeing does it, is to compressive more seats and make the aircraft more competitive compared with our development&quot; — Kevin Keniston, head of the department of comfort for passengers of Airbus in Europe said. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say parlours with complete 10-seater series for existing the 777th indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangements that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is caused by the threat from the 777th model&quot; — a specialist in the interior of the passenger compartment Mary Kirby, the founder and WFP Girl Network editor said. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not deliver a chair, but offer a catalogue of vendors from that airlines can choose. </seg>
<seg id="198"> The sellers of jets traveling the world even carry with them roulettes to check the competing lay-out. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Extolling comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with very dense configuration of salon for budget airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus proposals A350 with 10-seater ranks, but said that it still did not sell it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of salons, offering broader places when passing on some of the planes. </seg>

<seg id="223"> Within two weeks almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo came — these are one of the most brutal clashes since a truce over 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was supported at first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then the government of the apartheid era of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country. </seg>
<seg id="225"> After the armistice of 1992, it is the opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe that the country hardly will again come down to a full-scale conflict, but recent events forced to be fidgety foreign investors and local residents. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal fields in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the US. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The ruling party Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo&apos;s party accuse each other of the created tensions. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Renamo&apos;s party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Attacks on the former rebels then flared when government forces attacked Renamo&apos;s bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakama — the leader of the group, told the Financial Times of Fernando Mazanga, the representative Renamo. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The government blames Renamo instituting clashes, accusing party of the attack on soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The president Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Guebuza said AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt the &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all that remained of his forces to try to prove that he can force the government, their own decisions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that wars want to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="235"> However, concerns grew after the message that Mazanga said Renamo&apos;s refusal of the 1992 peace accord. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He said the Financial Times that meant non-compliance with the agreement by party Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="237"> &quot;Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness&quot; — said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The previous negotiations between parties made for easing of intensity which was increased by a series of collisions this year a little. </seg>
<seg id="239"> &quot;It is two influential people (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) who faced foreheads&quot; — Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open university and expert in Mozambique said. </seg>
<seg id="240"> None of them is not a good negotiator and none of them are not prepared to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="241"> The party of Renamo, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government. </seg>
<seg id="244"> The proportion of votes for Renamo been falling since 1992, whereas new party — the democracy movement of Mozambique (MDM) that was founded by a former member Renamo, as expected, was improving its performance on these elections. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza who should resign next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country. </seg>
<seg id="246"> &quot;He doesn&apos;t want multi-party democracy, he doesn&apos;t want transparent elections, he doesn&apos;t want the world because he does not want to leave the presidency&quot; — said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has, however, it has carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key road leading from the North to the South. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Most of the fights took place in Sofala province which is a few hundred kilometres North of Maputo, but includes Beira — port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal. </seg>
<seg id="249"> In June of Rio suspended the use of tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened with attack on the railway. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Mazanga it was evasive when asked him whether Renamo will repeat this threat. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Renamo&apos;s party wanted &quot;to alert the international community that matters in Mozambique go too well&quot;, – said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Instability strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also excited by corruption, slow rate of development and kidnappings which became frequent recently, speaks Fernando Lim, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;People think that responsibility for the future of the country had the government and the president who has to find a solution to these problems&quot; — he says. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Omar Sultuan, the demonstrator, said that people just want stability. </seg>
<seg id="255"> &quot;No one is initiated by neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the resumption of peace, they want a free access to roads&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Instructions for use electronic devices on aircraft in Australia in the meantime, will remain in force </seg>
<seg id="257"> Passengers of the Australian airlines will need and turn off further the tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the U.S. to mitigate the rules on these devices. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allowed the American carriers to change the procedures so that passengers can read books, watch video or play games on the devices during take-off and landing, provided that those will remain in &quot;flight mode&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers can already do it during the main part of flight, but many irritates that they have no access to the electronic books during take off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The Australian media believe this decision, which demanded that the American airlines to carry out a vast amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change the procedures in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="261"> In the office of civil aviation security also noted that they consider the application, but stressed that restrictions on use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight still ​ ​ work in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="262"> &quot;Office of civil Aviation security has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices on planes&quot; now — it said. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The fact is governed by rules that require airlines to provide maintaining security at any time, and from passengers — to follow safety rules on which they are reported by crew members. </seg>
<seg id="264"> The Virgin company that already discussed with the Office of civil Aviation Security increased use on board the entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but said that it will follow the instructions of the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="265"> &quot;We would welcome a review by the Office of civil Aviation security of the question of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (on board wireless entertainment system) is by our planes&quot; print secretary said. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Qantas said that will follow the rules in place at the time. </seg>
<seg id="267"> &quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and soon we do not plan it to change&quot; — she said. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The resolution FAU extends to the American airlines. </seg>
<seg id="269"> However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we certainly will carefully study the solution of the FAW and reason, caused it. </seg>
<seg id="270"> For carriers of the US the impact of the resolution will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Traders will have to prove that their planes have resistance to radio frequency interference from mobile devices, and also to review benefits, training materials, rules on the transport of hand luggage and instructions to passengers. </seg>
<seg id="272"> &quot;After the airline will test and will confirm the noise the stability of the fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices, such as tablets, ebooks and smartphones, at any height&quot; — said FAS. </seg>
<seg id="273"> In rare cases poor visibility the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices in a boarding. </seg>
<seg id="274"> In addition, according to the panel&apos;s recommendation, heavier devices must be placed under seats or in the overhead luggage compartments during take-off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Obama refuses the words on health care </seg>
<seg id="276"> Among the criticism storm president Obama is pushing back on the often repeated, unambiguous pledge yesterday that &quot;if you like your medical insurance plan, you can save it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Seeing that hundreds of thousands people receive notices of the termination of rendering services from the providers, republicans scarified the president in recent days that he misleads the American society. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Yesterday Obama adjusted its initial public promise slightly. </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;Most people who have health insurance, which works can save it&quot; — he said in his speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="280"> For what he called &quot;revival in the news&quot; on the end of service delivery, Obama called for the Americans receiving these notices to look for other options in the market. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than projected. </seg>
<seg id="282"> &quot;You get more favourable conditions&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="283"> The administration announced that it should be no surprise that 5% of people who buy insurance themselves may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the law on affordable health care. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;Let me say directly to those Americans: you deserve better &quot;— Sibelius in a statement to the committee on Energy and trade of the House of Representatives in Washington said. </seg>

<seg id="310"> The Blizzard studio free of charge released on the PC platformer of 1994 of Blackthorne. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Reports WoW Insider about it. </seg>
<seg id="312"> According to its data, the game became available in Battle.net in the section of the classic games Blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="313"> However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it now. </seg>
<seg id="314"> The game is still also unavailable to the Russian users. </seg>
<seg id="315"> As the media, a version that Blizzard now issued on PC transfer, outwardly is no different from the original version of the game. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Platformer Blackthorne that Blizzard released 19 years ago, initially came to the SNES consoles. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose residents were divided into dark and light kingdoms. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Once the dark governor Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become an individual governor of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The main character of the game is Vlaros&apos;s son Kyle, who was saved from death after being sent to Earth. </seg>

<seg id="325"> Koulson resorted to breaking of phone to check the secret message </seg>
<seg id="326"> The former editor of the News of the World newspaper Andy Koulson allegedly used &quot;breaking of telephone, surveillance and the opposition&quot; in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clarke held the post of Minister of interior at that moment. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The prosecutor, q.c. Andrew Edis informed Old-Bailey&apos;s court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received doubtful news that Clarke meets the &quot;an attractive special sovetnitsa&quot; Hannah Polbi. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The newspaper requested the private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to hack voice mail of Polbi and trapped her at home to an interview, but also Koulson too called it and left voice messages — heard court. </seg>
<seg id="329"> &quot;Charge believes that Mr. Koulson who is currently NotW editor - it is not such a person who will stand next to someone&apos;s house, hoping to take someone by surprise, he is the person who likes to offer history for people to see what they say&quot; — Mr. Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="330"> He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: breaking of phones, surveillance and the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to. </seg>
<seg id="333"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="334"> If he knew about hacking phones? </seg>
<seg id="335"> He said that no, we say: &quot;Oh, yes! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> Rumours of Clarke&apos;s novel for the first time drew attention to edition to News of the World when the source, which is sexually interested in Ms. Polbi was said: &quot;Don&apos;t waste time, it with Charles&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="337"> The tape with the voice messages received from his phone at least three times was withdrawn from Mulkeyr&apos;s house in August of last year. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Investigators also found computer records of the private detective in which Miss Polbi and her sister appeared as &quot;Projects&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="339"> During the period when she was under surveillance, the grandparents of Ms. Polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="340"> At this time, the former chief reporter Neville Tyorlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled surveillance movement of Ms. Polbi. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Having left it a voice message on June 18 the 2005th, Koulson told: &quot;I have a history which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I very much would like to discuss with Charles&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Mr. Edis said that Koulson&apos;s participation in this story happened on the same script as other influential people, for example to the former interior Minister David Blankett. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Jurors heard on Thursday that Koulson imposed confrontation with Mr. Blankett on the affair with a married woman while he met sootvetchitsy Rebekah Brooks, who was then married. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Koulson and Brooks deny conspiracy to other people in order to hack into the phones from 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Mulkeyr, Tyorlbek and Uezerap admitted breaking of phones. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In grounds of the Ministry of Interior there is no sister Circle group, which in the U.S. ranked Leps </seg>
<seg id="347"> In the databases of the Russian security officers of fraternal Circle group, which Washington was on a singer Grigory Leps, it does not appear. </seg>
<seg id="348"> As noted to &quot;Interfax&quot; in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation after in mass media there were messages on entering by the U.S. Treasury Department of Grigory Leps into check lists on suspicion in belonging to the Euroasian criminal syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;, all databases were checked, but such group it was revealed not. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Distribution of this information helps to uphold the myth of the so-called &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; that was ostensibly working abroad, believe in power structures. </seg>
<seg id="350"> &quot;Even in the name, &apos;The fraternal circle&apos;, is a certain element of mystery, a hint of a secret box contains. </seg>
<seg id="351"> &quot;All this is very similar to a PR event&quot;, the negotiator of the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="352"> The US Treasury announced on 31 October, entering in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate &quot;sister Circle&quot; of Arthur Badalyan, hryhoriy Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov. </seg>
<seg id="353"> The names on this list are suspected of links with a certain Vladislav Leontyev and gafurov Rakhimov that are seen as influential members of criminal groups and are in sanctions lists of the US since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="354"> According to American authorities, hryhoriy Leps &quot;serves as a courier for delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="355"> In the production centre of grigorii Leps declined to comment on allegations of the US to the singer, calling them &quot;nonsense&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="356"> In 2011, the US President Barack Obama carried fraternal Circle syndicate to the number of &quot;significant transnational organized crime groups&quot; and asked the Ministry of Finance &quot;to undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Entering the man in black lists of the U.S. Treasury entails freezing of its assets to the US and a ban on business contacts with it of people living in the States. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light on how the movements of the tail of the dog are associated with her mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies have shown that happy dog wagging its tail to the right side (in terms of the dog) while alarmed dogs vilna with a tail, mainly to the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in wiggle by the tail and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, the neuroscientist from Trent university, says: &quot;It is well known that gave people the left and right sides of the brain differently participate in shaping driving forces who cause positive or negative emotions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we tried to look at it and at other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that the same as a person at dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how dogs respond to multidisciplinary povilivaniye khvostov of other dogs, researchers tracked animals when they watch movies about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analysed their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Perhaps we will understand already soon why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another </seg>
<seg id="367"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have demonstrated to dogs of video with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors, and we can manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="368"> When animals saw for the rest emotionless dog moved the tail to the right (in terms of the dog wagging tail), they remained entirely weakened. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noticed that the tail inclined mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging tail), their heartbeat became frequent and they looked alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think dogs deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact, he believes that dogs learned from the experience, what movements they should worry, and what — no. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He notices: &quot;If there are several meetings with other dogs and often wiggle their tail to one side are associated with more friendly behaviour, and the right side provides less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Researchers say that these results can yield to owners, vets and trainers a better understanding of emotions of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="374"> A specialist in behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, visiting fellow at veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said he was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides have value for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year, a group of scientists from the university of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn heads to the left if look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if look at the happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in other scientific work of the university of Victoria in Canada, said: &quot;Dogs approached more frequently a dog robot when wiggle of her tail went to the left, but not to the right instead of becoming alarmed — contrary conduct in relation to the Italian research&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be because dogs are in various studies not fully perceived animals in movies or dogs robots as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It could be useful to study how dogs respond to the real dogs, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;While on various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs no exception&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour could perhaps be registered very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Whether the elite of Europe is prepared to do business with England? </seg>
<seg id="382"> Campaign of Business for Britain was launched in April with the commitment to bring together representatives of business and to determine which changes the founders of prosperity and jobs of Great Britain want to see in relations with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="383"> To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to introduce the ideas of Great Britain, business and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The YouGov company interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad swath of business in Britain in size, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Findings of the poll would be surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We found that the vast majority of businesses looking for export capabilities beyond Europe now, paying particular attention to the countries that modernized and grow, while EU countries to stagnate. </seg>

<seg id="390"> The last and most indicative - our survey of business executives found that a clear majority wants Britain taught a course of a variation of the contract and for its relations with the EU based on trade, but not on policy. </seg>
<seg id="391"> This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists &quot;significant change&quot; that will return powers back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The stakes are high - fulfilling the changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for Great Britain will provide 16 per cent shift in the voting remaining in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports its plan to review conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It also shows that the case is that the review will lead to significant shift in the current balance of power back towards Britain. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The best conditions for the British business are possible and are becoming more and more necessary because the eurozone took a way of closer economic and financial association. </seg>
<seg id="396"> The priority should be given to jobs and growth in Britain, and as show our survey, it means a strengthened focusing on trade for business and fundamental changes in standard activities of Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="414"> In Siberia you should not be a Wigan: the Orangery tomato will not replace soup </seg>
<seg id="415"> Why the vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent for RIA-Novosti unclarified. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The people who absolutely denied animal products should not live in Siberia. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Here to them not to transfer winter without loss to health, and no casing tomatoes compensate for them, the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of the Day of Wigan consider. </seg>
<seg id="418"> To drink oil in litres </seg>
<seg id="419"> The strict vegetarianism when refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life. </seg>
<seg id="420"> However, dietitians are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia to adhere to such strict rules in food, at least insalubriously to health. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Full refusal of animal products is harmful. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Animal protein contains essential amino acids that are very difficult to repair the vegetable. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is necessary to include in a seimas at least milk or eggs &quot;- the dietician Marina Bogay is sure. </seg>
<seg id="424"> It cites as an example the fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The richest with him vegetable/seed oil - underwear. </seg>
<seg id="426"> &quot;To consume it in quantities are necessary for a man, you must drink in litres! &quot;- the nutritionist says. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to diet in the winter. </seg>
<seg id="428"> During this season, the vegetarianism is particularly called into question. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In the context of our realities require exceptional food. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Not to freeze the increased calorie content is needed. </seg>
<seg id="431"> &quot;If the person limits himself on animal products, respectively, the calorie content he did not gather additionally&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="432"> A registered dietitian Olga paznyak agrees. </seg>
<seg id="433"> She adds that imported vegetables and fruit isn&apos;t an option. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It is better for person to feed mainly on products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The genetic code is set to the best assimilation and uptake of these products. </seg>
<seg id="436"> And in winter, people don&apos;t want not cucumber pogryzt and hot soup or something else posytny &quot;- the doctor explained the position. </seg>
<seg id="437"> According to her, from this, that vegetarians can eat, various cereals, grains, legumes, local vegetables, remaining apples at the winter, the frozen berries are relatively useful. </seg>
<seg id="438"> But, clearly, it is not enough for good food. </seg>
<seg id="439"> According to a gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a level of vitamins sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Full transition to vegetarianism in our rigid environment when the temperature could change in days to 30 degrees and in May snow lies is inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The body to life needs energy, and that, above all, fat &quot;- is made by the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Doctors note that the veganstvo is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Children grow, they need construction material, including in the form of amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="444"> And in line to vegetarianism, we give them the defective. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Pregnant women also need more protein, vitamins and microelements from the menu. </seg>
<seg id="446"> &quot;Veganki them is received less&quot;, - Bogay is sure. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Arifulina said that an adult is free to choose anything, &quot;to play those toys that wants&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="448"> It has already created organism, the skeleton, bodies. </seg>
<seg id="449"> And yet the children should eat fully. </seg>
<seg id="450"> If parents give it any microelements or amino acids, choosing to him that he would eat, it is just a violation of the rights of the child. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Tomorrow, you will not restore the lack of certain substances for brain development, sight, bones any more&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="452"> All interviewed medical professionals agree in opinion on low quality of growing in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruit. </seg>
<seg id="453"> That lead to us and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer microelements necessary for us than (grown) in an open ground. </seg>
<seg id="454"> &quot;The Quality of products, not that&quot;, says Bogay. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Sometimes the desire of producers to reap a higher yield causes damage to quality. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and not fragrant&quot; - the doctor gave examples, adding that they were likely to be stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizers. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Also become suppliers not of vitamins, and pulp. </seg>
<seg id="459"> The Head of Laboratory of Siberian physical-technical institute of Agricultural Issues, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with it. </seg>
<seg id="460"> She said that at the right approach and respect for all the rules and requirements in greenhouses cultivation of full vegetables is possible. </seg>
<seg id="461"> If they try to banish more from square metre, of course, and will begin to water more frequently, and to overfeed plants with mineral fertilizer. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes quickly grow, they large but watery and unsweetened &quot;, she explains, adding that the quality issue first depends conscience on the manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Russia out of the fight for urban pollution cars </seg>
<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve traffic problems of the major cities were observed in the majority of megacities of the world since the second half of the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It was typically talked or their reorganization and expansion of roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and timing of their use. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The example of Singapore, where the rigid quotas for a rise in the number of private cars is imposed is widely known, and the right of acquisition are bought at auction. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Its price may exceed the price of a car by two to three times. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The European cities, including London, imposed fees for entrance to the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, enter the so-called green zones where travelers is allowed cars with certain ecoclass also using quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles). </seg>
<seg id="470"> The environment agency the protection of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;the five-year plan of clean air&quot; in the total cost about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> As said &quot;Kommersant&quot; the director of enforcement of transport pollution of municipal bureau of Environmental protection of Beijing Lee Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year period - reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, growth in the number of private cars to the greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) as well as increase for no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="472"> According to the agency, now Road in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the general air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Among the main measures of the programme - limiting the use of the road, as well as additional taxes for car owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> In addition, urban measures of &quot;The green five-year plan&quot; include the transition to fuel European standards accelerated compared with another country, the introduction of local system ecostandards and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on outdated vehicles (in addition, a boost financial programme to replace old cars on hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and the office), development of public transport (including high-speed). </seg>
<seg id="475"> The ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the People&apos;s Republic of China their six) one day in a week (the relevant information contains in registration plate of the vehicle), and also delivery of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of action of a lottery, the total of permissions to registration of private cars in Beijing made only a third of number of 2010) is also among automobile innovations of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="476"> According to the existing &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot; state program, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in their 2012 was 138). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to the Ministry to protect the Environment and Natural Resources, in 2011 on &quot;mobile sources&quot; 41% of all pollutant emissions in the atmosphere of cities fell. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars exceed industrial and, in St. Petersburg, by nine times ten times. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In the Russian Federation so far, only start thinking about opportunities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that the administrative and fiscal measures to suppress demand for road trips - business clearly unpopular, they can be taken by society only on condition of their total universality. </seg>
<seg id="481"> If Moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters poorly sensitive to any regulatory to influence the official and personal cars and cars &quot;exclusive&quot; users that the total number is not less than 200,000 (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow). </seg>
<seg id="482"> The other day urbanists from the WHAT center in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of the urban areas between a housing estate, the area of pavement and the number of road transport is analysed. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Key findings of investigators: the city centre is provided by roads twice smaller required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or simply on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="484"> As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but storage of cars, not to expand, and to reduce the carriageway (the streets became more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of a security zone of the historic center (the total area about 3212 hectares covering a number of central regions of the city). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Will lead tax maneuver that increases the tax on mining (MET) on oil at the same time, with lower export duties and excise rise to a rise in the price of fuel. </seg>
<seg id="486"> According to experts, these measures may provide additional 619.3 billion rubles in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Trip on dirt, rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care </seg>
<seg id="488"> Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bvelle and his team perform almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> In this West African country of doctors there is not a lot of — only one on 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="491"> Vote here or via your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="492"> Dr. George Bvelle — one top 10 heroes of CNN of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="493"> You can vote for it or for any of the other 10 main characters that he became a Hero of the year of CNN. </seg>
<seg id="494"> This person would receive $250 million to continuation of the outstanding work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> For 21 years George Bvelle saw his father was restored to life and falling again into unconsciousness, wandering on hospitals that were not equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Dzhamef Bvelle was injured in road accident in 1981, near Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="497"> First at it the hand was only broken, but the arising prior infection spread to the brain and caused bruising that recalled itself until the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="498"> &quot;In Cameroon, there were no neurosurgeons — George Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had money, we would make it from Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead of this Bvelle escorted for years, the father in a crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment which they could get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It is hard — Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="502"> — You can leave the house at 5 a.m., come running in the hospital to be the first, but you&apos;re not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> There is a lot of patients. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some may die because they should wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation is not much changed since the father Bvelle died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> By comparison, the ratio in the United States — one doctor for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if Cameroonians could address to the doctor, it would be too expensive for much of them. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health expenditure in it are private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;Their only problem is poverty — Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="511"> — And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the suffering of the father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle has resolved to do anything about it. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Last year, Dr George Bvelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central hospital Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="515"> It also established ASCOVIME non-profit organization that provides countryside trips on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008, and his group of volunteers assisted nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday, and to 30 people deadlock in vans, tie medical belongings to roofs and go on a rugged terrain to visit the villages in need. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Not always they are accompanied by good luck. </seg>
<seg id="519"> More than once they had to push cars through rivers and dirt. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they come, they meet, as real heroes: it is a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms which local residents can only proposal. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for a holiday, and Bvelle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning, the crew begins accepting hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We accept 500 people on each trip&quot; — Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come with all the district in a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these clinics of the day off provides various medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people were receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others may get crutches, the proposed points, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evening the crew provides simple operations under local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Operations were usually performed in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator to cover operational and sanitary equipment processing, Bvelle and his volunteers work into the early morning hours of Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="531"> It is excessive speed, but rural musicians usually help maintain the commitment of the crew. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They all night beating the drum that we were awake and continued to work&quot; — Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday members of the crew go back to the city, tired but proud of their work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> This group consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students performed 700 free operations for last year, and they know that their aid may be of great value to those they help. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One person explained that the free operation to treat hernia received by him would enable it to work again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;It will change the future for me and my family&quot; — the man said. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to these clinical receptions at weekends and work in the hospital as a surgeon Bvelle also works at the nights in private clinics around Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="538"> This second work, according to him, provides 60% of financing its non-profit organization; other means be covered through private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I don&apos;t even know when he sleeps&quot; — Katie O&apos;Malley, a medical student of the second year of Drekselsky university in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the group Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="540"> He always or in hospital, or attempts to earn money for the organization that it was possible to continue those campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For future doctors and nurses, such as O&apos;Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bvella to achieve its objectives, is the ability of practice that they were never at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We had the opportunity to assist on operations where we helped remove spots of blood or hold tools for doctor Bvelle&quot; — O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="543"> As a student second-year student, you would never get this possibility in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Student volunteers usually pay the journey to Cameroon, often arriving with the proposed drugs. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on arrival in Yaoundé their food, transport and training Drew by Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;It is a hero, undoubtedly&quot; — O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It provides the life of this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Bvelle almost permanent the workload is not a difficult experience. </seg>
<seg id="549"> To help lead happy life to another, to keep its promise to the father — him that brings it great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I am so happy when I do this work - Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="551"> — And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees what I do. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I do it that people laughed to reduce their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Visit the website ASCOVIME and look than you can help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> To &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in the US, the new name - &quot;A sister circle&quot; was finally assigned </seg>
<seg id="556"> This week, the black list of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in America was filled with new names and four companies. </seg>
<seg id="557"> The US Treasury entered into &quot;A sister circle&quot; of the three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and the Israeli. </seg>
<seg id="558"> A famous singer Grigori Leps, whom the US suspect of carriage of money to members of the group was one of the Russians. </seg>
<seg id="559"> In total in a black list of the US 22 people involved in &quot;A sister circle&quot; and six entities affiliated with it. </seg>
<seg id="560"> However, many experts have questioned that such organization does exist. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;A statement to &apos;A fraternal circle&apos; is like trying to combine separate criminal groups&quot; more, an expert in organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti said earlier. </seg>
<seg id="562"> In his view, &quot;The fraternal circle&quot; reflects a popular perception of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I didn&apos;t meet anybody in the Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such criminal organisation&quot;, - quotes Mr. Galeotti the American Center for research of corruption and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="564"> A professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="565"> &quot;If they also work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization&quot; - the Centre for research of corruption and organized crime provides her words. </seg>
<seg id="566"> In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that &quot;The fraternal circle&quot; brings together in a greater measure of confidants of the Russian kingpin Aslan Usoyan known as Grandpa Hassan. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The criminal authority was killed in January this year. </seg>
<seg id="568"> Thus, Lasha Shushanashvili&apos;s activities and xachariah Kalashova, filled up the list in 2012, was closely associated with Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri mirzoev had to Grandpa Hassan nephew. </seg>
<seg id="569"> However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals and have nothing to do with Usoyan. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In his opinion, all of them were united by rather common financial and criminal interests, for example supply of drugs from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Meanwhile, the scandal over inclusion in &quot;A sister circle&quot; of grigorii Leps, a favorite singer of the Russian president Vladimir Putin - drew the attention of the Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Naturally, we hope that we will get more detailed information in this regard such a decision why it in such lists was introduced was made from our American partner colleagues, the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov said. </seg>
<seg id="573"> In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="574"> As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Tony Blair said he would use chance of return as prime minister of Great Britain, but acknowledges that return is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="576"> The night before in an interview to mark the fifth anniversary of the resignation, the 59-year-old politician set out the eyes of various aspects of domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Since the resignation in June 2007, after ten years on the leader&apos;s post, Blair largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting the majority of the comments to foreign affairs and the role of ambassador to the Quartet of Middle Eastern peacekeepers. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Answering a question, whether it returned to the prime minister&apos;s position, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, told: &quot;Yes, of course, but hardly it happens, so...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="579"> The head coach &quot;Milan&quot; Massimiliano Allegri regretted neutral result in a match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with &quot;Lazio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> The expert also noted that failures on the launch are caused by a series of injuries of the leading players. </seg>
<seg id="581"> It is a pity to me that we did not manage to win, - Allegri quotes Tmw. </seg>
<seg id="582"> The team played the sound match, having created 3-4 good opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="583"> In the first time, we allowed nothing to &quot;Lazio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="584"> In the second Romans added, but in general I can&apos;t say that we lost concentration. </seg>
<seg id="585"> It was necessary to win. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Last season we conducted a hit task in the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Now we lag behind schedule, but it is caused by a series of injuries of key players. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Rami and Honda? </seg>
<seg id="589"> These are very good players, with nature. </seg>
<seg id="590"> However, our structure is also now good. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Look at Kaka who held a high-level meeting. </seg>
<seg id="592"> The British police hands to Assange delivery notification </seg>
<seg id="593"> The British police presented today, the notice of delivery of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for asylum. </seg>

<seg id="605"> Virtually every publication of his strict, built on contemporary vital material stories and stories causes hot discussions among critics of the most different directions. </seg>
<seg id="606"> It can be argued that the aggregate articles about prose and Senchin&apos;s journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature since the late 1990s, before the start of the 2010th. </seg>
<seg id="607"> In discussions about works of &quot;one of the most disputable modern writers&quot;, according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, mostly it is talked that its participants understand as the word &quot;literature&quot; what see the present and the future not only our literature, but also life. </seg>

<seg id="610"> Snowden could be questioned in Russia </seg>
<seg id="611"> The ex-employee of the American intelligence services Edward Snowden is likely to not travel outside of Russia to give evidence in cases of the wiretap of telephone conversations of the German chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="612"> As told &quot;Interfax&quot; on Friday, the source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from the State prosecutor&apos;s office of Germany in writing or internally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Edward Snowden&apos;s travel outside of Russia is almost deleted. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;In this case it will lose their refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by the countries - U.S. allies&quot;, the negotiator of the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="615"> &quot;However, in principle, the State prosecutor&apos;s office of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written matters to Snowden&quot;, added the source, adding that this issue should be worked out at domestic level. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Previously, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify on the case of a wiretap the American intelligence services of negotiations of the German chancellor. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="618"> The ex-employee of the CIA it clear that he knows a lot of things. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA blocked all its movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="620"> But this requires to clearly define all conditions of his arrival &quot;, - Shtrebele reported to Euronews TV channel. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The advocate Snowden Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement by a source of &quot;Interfax&quot;, said that his client can cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how - will solve. </seg>
<seg id="622"> A US citizen Edward Snowden working for the National Security Agency (NSA) of the US and the CIA fled to Hong Kong in May 2013 then published information on classified intelligence operations of the US on surveillance on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Snowden flied through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because its passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities which in absentia brought him serious charges and prior to the beginning of August remained in a transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The first of August Snowden received a document on temporary asylum to it in the territory of Russia for a period of the year and on the same day, left &quot;Sheremetyevo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Yesterday, the American&apos;s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client had obtained a job in &quot;a major Russian company&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Last week reported the German media about surveillance by the NSA Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="627"> According to journalists, Americans started listening to telephone conversations of the chancellor in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The tracking station was allegedly in the US Embassy in Berlin. </seg>

<seg id="638"> Children must learn myths and legends as &quot;models of the way of life&quot;, the author says. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Tales from the Torah could show that &quot;the brute force cannot defeat distinguished cunning&quot; and legends of king Arthur show how it is important to have dreams. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Saying that many myths will be &quot;too wild, too blatant and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools&quot;, Crossley-Holland supports &quot;careful selection&quot; of the texts suitable on age. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I think it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I supported their introduction to the curriculum twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He added that &quot;excessive moralistic&quot; the sponsors and teachers &quot;battles interest&quot; off to school, and the main ideas &quot;are sublimated&quot; in an exciting stories. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Crossley-Holland, which was translated by &quot;Beowulf&quot; from Anglo-Saxon language, as well as &quot;The collection of Norwegian myths&quot; for Penguin and &quot;British folk Tales&quot; publishing house wrote, said: &quot;Of course, You can have intentions, but it is better for you to keep them around&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Perhaps big difference between an adult author writing for adults, and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope. </seg>
<seg id="646"> That everything should be simplified or lead not that to a happy ending, but it is essential that there was a innate understanding of the good and evil. </seg>
<seg id="647"> And it must be sublimated; it is open through history, but it is not clearly formulated. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Old principle: show, not to say. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> It first of all crisis of defaults on poor consumer credit and mass dismissals of workers. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now - not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Recently it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce queues &quot;- the chief economist at Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graf said, introducing a quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now the nominal growth of salaries in Russia - about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> At inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But profitability of the Russian companies falls so probably they will be established to improve staff costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising to 10%, GDP - only to 2%, Mr. Grafe explained. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Companies have faced profitability reduction. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If she did not grow up, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The Russian business could raise the salaries, chief economist at Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin comments. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To lure staff from the party or to hold this, employers should raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia is also supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. Grafe, because of the highest rates on consumer loans of multiplicative effect this type of credit does not have on the national economy. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;We are no did not see the benefit for economy of consumer credit growth, money is not at odds on the economy, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot; - the economist said. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem in other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on the poor loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> They are taken by mostly relatively poor people who have nothing to provide in security. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Interest on such loans high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, do not return to their more often &quot;, Mr. Grafe noted. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - possible crisis of defaults on poor loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The director of the HSE Bank institute Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of emerging banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit institutions, without access to cheap resources which the State Banks have, were forced to raise funds of the population with high interest. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, the State Banks came to the track of war and began to reduce lending rates, says economist continues. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit institutions cannot give out loans under the same per cent, or they will have a negative interest margins. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If the State Banks do not refuse a dumping, Russia is threatened by full bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes. </seg>
<seg id="676"> In recent weeks, the economist believes the cancellation of certificates of a number of banks as a harbinger of mass crash. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;The State Banks will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was never intended to systemic crisis &quot;, the head of the institute warns. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But growth in consumption will slow down and without crisis of non-payments, believe in Investbank - because of failure of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military, put in the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partly the autumn to consumption will be broken by a freezing tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, lower inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only a point: if investments do not grow (and prerequisites to it are not yet available - see the reference), increasing consumption all the same will be slow, are confident of Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not see prerequisites for implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> In his estimation, Russia&apos;s economy will begin to decline at the cost of oil less than 90 dollars/barrel. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank yet not in force to lower interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation fell, and banks began to increase rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to an inflation targeting &quot;, - Clemens Graf said. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The percentage the Central Bank policy does not affect market rates, only affects pace of interbank lending. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;For the Central Bank is the collapse of all hopes&quot;, - Clemens Graf assessed. </seg>
<seg id="689"> The money received at auctions of the Central Bank uses banks not lending to economy, and for the office of the liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as the rates are falling, the exchange rate changes at once, it means that the funds try to leave on speculation against ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work&quot;, Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to start up ruble in &quot;free swimming&quot; by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But it is necessary or to do it before, or to increase the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he says. </seg>
<seg id="693"> In his estimation, rouble exchange rate is now artificially by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> I cut only one road - to weaken, the expert concludes. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the Central Bank has provoked in financiers while a reasonable doubt that the elimination of a currency corridor is not part of a policy along with their weakening of the ruble, it can bring down ruble much stronger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel&apos;s wiretap </seg>
<seg id="697"> A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met to Moscow Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Whether in conversation the issue was discussed Snowden as a witness by the State prosecutor&apos;s office of Germany on the case of possible tapping the phone of German chancellor of the spetssltsuzhbama of the US could be interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snowden offered to provide the necessary evidence. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The meeting would take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He made it know - Hans-Christian Strebele said, that he knows a lot of things. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the National security agency run by Keith Alexander blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> But you must first determine all conditions of his arrival clearly. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are now taking steps in response to the scandal over spying programmes of the US. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The Senate Committee on Intelligence approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. department of electronic investigation yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="706"> THE FAW: &quot;Air passengers can use gadgets now by aircraft (but not to call from a mobile phone)&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Air passengers will be able to use the electronic devices throughout the voyage to read, work, play games, movies and listen to music, but not to talk by mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers should not expect changes will occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How quickly this change is implemented, will vary depending on airline, the FAU administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference said. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines should show the FAW as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update the manuals for members of the flight crew and the rule to lay devices to conform to the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The FAW said that he had already received plans from some airlines to increased use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices soon&quot; — said FAS. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Now passengers are required to disable the smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They should not restart them until the plane reaches the height of 10,000 feet and captain will not give a green light. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers have to turn off devices again when the plane decreases to planting, and not to include them until the plane appears on earth. </seg>
<seg id="717"> According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxing, said the FAW. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most of the new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, as expected, meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Glejding, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed these changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a sure bet&quot; — said Gleyding. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We frankly tired to feel like &quot;persons on duty on school&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But Internet connection to surf, an exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at the height of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency. </seg>
<seg id="723"> It will be invited to passengers to switch the smartphones, tablets and other devices in a plane mode. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Thus, still any &quot;Words with friends&quot; — intellectual Internet game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on a smartphone in 2011 when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device when the plane was at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> And heavier devices such as laptops, it will still be required to pile in the luggage compartment as they can hurt someone if fly on all salon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also remain prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulatory powers to phone calls relate to the Federal Communications commission, but not the FAW. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The FAW can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month Mark Rozenker from the National Transportation safety Board, the national expert on the safety of the transport of CBS News, stated that cell phones are still regarded as risk. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;Cell phones — it is really a problem not only because they have the potential to interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is airborne&quot; — Rozenker said. </seg>
<seg id="731"> The industry advisory committee created by the FAW to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allowed greater use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> In recent years, pressure on the FAW for the purpose of easing of restrictions on their use has increased. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Critics such as Democratic senator from Missouri Claire Makkaskil, argue that for the prohibition there is no compelling reasons of security. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Compliance with restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult to be provided as the use of devices becomes universal. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that to a third of passengers forget or ignored instructions to shut down the devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> The FAW started restricting use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of interference with the navigation and communication equipment when passengers launched with themselves FM radios — high-tech gadgets that time. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also developed and approved by the FAW as resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Airlines offer passengers using Wi-fi at cruising altitude for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The planes modified for Wi - Fi - systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority of liners is adapted to greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices usually radiate radio signals of a much lower power than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit minimal signals when you turn the pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But the signs are more powerful when devices download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those who achieved easing restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices, there was an Amazon.com company. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011 the representatives of the company loaded the entire airliner devices for reading e-books Kindle and flew on him to check for problems, but did not find them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Members of the FAS advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether any risk is the use of devices. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd from the National association of air passengers said that considers interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Other members of the committee said that there are only individual reports of pilots affirming that devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports, the very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAW allowed pilots to require passengers to disable devices during instrument landings in limited visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The group of representatives of the tourism industry has welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step toward passengers who now use a set of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAW acknowledges that the comfort of passengers was not incompatible with safety and security&quot; — Roger Dow, the director-general of Tourist association of the USA said. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Vilnius suspects Moscow of an attempt to defame the Lithuanian president </seg>
<seg id="753"> Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the eastern partnership a statement to the agency BNS made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB). </seg>

<seg id="756"> According to intelligence service, the preparation of information act is committed by the department of the analysis of public management processes of the presidential Administration on interregional and cultural ties with foreign countries. </seg>
<seg id="757"> The structure is headed by Eugene Umerenkov who more than was once visiting Lithuania and who took part in congress of the Lithuanian people&apos;s party. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Also a party of exploitation allegedly is an employee of the division V. Smirnov. </seg>
<seg id="759"> As an intelligence service claims that Smirnov under cover scientific work until the end of 2012 was regularly to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and members of the media. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Now entry into the country is prohibited Smirnov. </seg>

<seg id="769"> The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could deprive the process of smoking of joy </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could deprive the process of cigarette smoking of joy. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further testing before tests in the public are necessary, to which some years, but professor Ronald Kristall from medical college will be required Whale Cornell in New York said that the first results encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We very much hope that such a strategy of the use of a vaccine can help, finally, to millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all methods that are available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction strong enough to overcome it through these modern means&quot; — professor Cornell said. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotinic antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start making a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing financial nicotine blow by a smoker. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In tests the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine subsequently, continued their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="778"> And mice who had not been given a vaccine, &quot;relaxed&quot; and it is a sign that nicotine reached their brain, for the researchers say. </seg>
<seg id="779"> These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine journal. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of a new vaccine will probably be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Kristall said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But it is more likely that she will be used by smokers to quit smoking. </seg>
<seg id="785"> &quot;They will know that if they will start smoking again, they will not receive from this joy because nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit&quot; — he said. </seg>

<seg id="793"> The new payment for hand luggage extends to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Border said that will levy $25 if the tax is paid in advance, and $100 if traveling pay, with only have been at a gate. </seg>
<seg id="795"> The representative of the state border Kate O&apos;Malley said the payment of $100 must force passengers to think of payment in advance. </seg>
<seg id="796"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to charge for it&quot; — she said. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Companies have begun charging fees for the first and second bag surrendered in luggage, in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Passengers trying to avoid these fees fill so much, how many will be able, in your hand luggage placed in the top luggage compartments because of what in these compartments often there is no place. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Collection — one way to force passengers to carry by less on board. </seg>
<seg id="800"> O&apos;Malley said the new charges not really for the sake of making money. </seg>
<seg id="801"> The fact is that the most loyal customers of border state that it becomes more difficult to find a place in the top luggage compartments. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Passengers who buy tickets on the site of the airline would not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="803"> This means that a passenger in turn at the opening to the flight border may be able to carry a bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> O&apos;Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at the check-in desks of border is designed to ensure that passengers will know about taxes before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="805"> New charge border for hand luggage will not begun to be raised until the summer, although the date has not yet been set. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Passengers often complain about the pay for baggage and other charges, but airlines adore them. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on Wall Street believe addition of baggage collection is familiar that airlines raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> However, most of them did not concern charges for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. entered the first charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter of Allegiant Air followed suit later. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with such taxes is the Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen who closely tracks additional charges said. </seg>
<seg id="812"> In his assessment in the report of December 2011, the prosecution for hand luggage brings Spirit of $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former senior manager of the Midwest Airlines, flew the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting to him that he would find in the gate when passengers face unusual charge Spirit for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;The process of landing was the smoothest that I had seen in his career in airlines&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth, and the emergence of a fight at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and landing held rapidly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Border also follows Spirit on the payment of $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Border said that passengers who get soda or juice, can leave themselves all can and that adding coffee it will be available free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> She will still distribute free of charge water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> US Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but denied it in seven months after passengers started to complain and no other major airline followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Border initiative of charging for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline — is its last resort to attract customers on its website. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It allowed all airlines incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, but not to resort to online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> But border went further all in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September, he started to serve twice less bonus miles of often flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday it cut bonus number of miles to 25 per cent from a trip miles. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, a trip to 1,000 miles with border purchased from online travel agency would allow to receive 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site border. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Border have a base of loyal customers in his hometown of Denver, but his case is reduced and becomes unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenue fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities were reduced by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic is trying to correct border finance within sale to airline. </seg>
<seg id="832"> Putin made impunity for friend Assad </seg>
<seg id="833"> And now - news because of the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck rockets of the Russian production, which reportedly intended to &quot;Hezbollah&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Syria today met an important condition - to destroy the production of chemical weapons by 1 November. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It was made under the agreement brokered by Russia and that allowed the US not to launch military action, which they closely approached this summer. </seg>
<seg id="836"> In more detail our chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel will tell on weapons and that all this means to the Syrian president. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Washington stated that Assad&apos;s regime will be punished for it. </seg>
<seg id="838"> More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas. </seg>
<seg id="839"> And punishment came. </seg>
<seg id="840"> But not in the form of the American bombing, and in the form of a transaction that Assad&apos;s friend - Vladimir Putin arranged. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Syria will refuse the chemical weapons to the middle of next year. </seg>
<seg id="842"> And today is an important milestone. </seg>
<seg id="843"> The group of international experts reported that Syria put out of action, the stated factories on the production of chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="844"> More long-term and arduous task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it. </seg>
<seg id="845"> We understand that it is about 1,000 tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Earlier Washington said that the days of Assad are considered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I think Assad must leave. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The question is not whether occurs it, and in when it happens. </seg>
<seg id="849"> It is not legitimate anymore and should leave. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Also feels even more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> His opponents are separated and poorly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Its people to flee their homes, many are starving. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Some should feed on the leaves and cats. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Many believe that Bashar al-Assad avoided prosecution for mass murder. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad impression of the individual ready to cooperate. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions. </seg>
<seg id="859"> When a child dies from hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother than that did not kill him using chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Assad remains so far. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Also changes the weapon for power. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Domich will work 240 hours for an extremist movie per social networks </seg>
<seg id="863"> The Lenin district court in Tomsk sentenced by 240 hours compulsory works of the resident who placed the video of an extremist nature on the social network, the representative of the press-service regional court told RIA-Novosti on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="864"> According to court, in March 2013, the man posted on the page on the popular social network video, which is registered in the federal list of extremist material. </seg>
<seg id="865"> On it criminal case in the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation &quot;The action aimed at the incitement of hatred and hostility, and to degrade a person made publicly&quot; were made. </seg>
<seg id="866"> &quot;The Lenin district court heard the case in a special order and found a man guilty of the above crime by imposing a sentence in the form of 240 hours of community service&quot;, the negotiator of the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="867"> She added that a man completely pleaded guilty. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The parents of intersex children could choose &quot;uncertain sex&quot; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor at the children born with external genitals of intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="870"> The newborn will not necessarily attribute male or female any more. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require parents to call any gender of these children, allowing parents to specify gender as &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; in their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on exploitation on assignment of a floor by the newborn, and counter discrimination of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I&apos;m not a man and not a woman&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> I will remain the patchwork product created by doctors with bruises and scars. </seg>
<seg id="875"> About one of two thousand children born each year is neither the boy nor the girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They have an interseksualnost, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;breach of sexual development&quot; — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovarian or testes) or unusually developed external genitals. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Wallis Simpson may have been interseksualy. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identity remains poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that if the sex cannot be identified, better to use all available information and to give it than to wait and trace psychological and physical development of the child before the operation if at all, it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="879"> The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher who specializes in issues of gender identity, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Intersex children create an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;Some people have threatening violation lives that require surgery, but most children does not have them&quot; — he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign a floor without operation and then look as a person develops. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science how at the child any gender identity will develop, is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> No one can answer questions about why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It as a mystery about why people also being homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report sent to the European commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender as their state is not concerned with gender, and their biological structure that does not meet only neither male nor female, and is typical of both at the same time, or is not specific to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, the breast and the constitution; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also provides an overview of discrimination, intersex and transgender people in employment, and about the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes because of prejudice face. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boys with gender biases have a special camp now. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal has already allow adults to put male, female or &quot;the third floor&quot; in the official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Norri Mai-Uelbi became the first person, recognized &quot;asexual&quot; by defended in court the right to save the &quot;uncertain&quot; sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the Ministry of Interior, in the German passports third symbol in addition to M and F — X, that is intersex will be used. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighbouring France gender issues still be controversial, according to news release on the France 24 channel. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011 dozens of lawmakers from France, this imposed Catholic country, signed a petition to seize &quot;the gender theory&quot; from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we overturn two other pillars of civilization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that applied to children sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;To raise the child relatively hard and without additional restrictions, particularly if you don&apos;t know the sex of the child&quot; — she told the website for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with male and female genitalia, called hermaphrodites — by name beautiful Greek god who wielded signs of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And more than just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then back to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many challenge the ethical foundations for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the floor assigned to it when grows. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century it was called&quot; an urgent psychiatric case &quot;&quot; — Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When these children were born, you called not a psychiatrist — you called the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory of how to treat children with mutilation of intermediate type, was proposed by Dr John Mani at Johns Hopkins University, who considered that gender is easily change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; into circulation and claimed that environment signals, including social — how parents raise the child — interact with genes and the child&apos;s hormones, defining, whether the person will consider himself as the man or the woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case of 1966 known as &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theories had been called into question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised the boy&apos;s parents, whose penis was injured during negligent circumcision, to fully gelding the child, having also deleted his testicles, and to raise it as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> &quot;Mani presented a case as a good example of transition, but it was not so&quot; — Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When the boy was about 15 years old, he is again a boy and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But in 38 years he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations on a sex change announced themselves &quot;unhappy with result&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="913"> That is was also Jim Bruce&apos;s case, the 36-year-old writer from the State of Montana, which was born with male chromosomes of XY but mutilation of intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors could not determine accurately whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis, and were confident that he will never be able to lead &quot;fulfilling life&quot; of the man. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external genital and Bruce&apos;s testicles were surgically removed, and it was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Began to give it female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew that I am not a girl&quot; — he said ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was miserable, but it was very difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In 18 years to it the vaginoplastika was appointed. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he required medical records. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he learned was awful. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give it to the body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of mutilation. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Having learned the truth, he is again a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing the chest. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Operation made it futile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today, he defended others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring into norm perception of people with an interseksualnost. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Ann Temar-Mettis, executive director of the California law association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;tends to encourage the demonization and stigma&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child&quot; uncertain sex &quot;&quot; — she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We fear that it will promote intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to appropriate male or female, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we have yet to see how this law, therefore, everything will prove that we can do — it to speculate. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Temar-Mettis said her organization supports the Australian law as &quot;it allows adults to opt for the third floor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a formal sex&quot; — she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The German law means its request at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This battle that small children should not enter at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arleene Barats, the mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter in violation of sexual development and that helps hundreds of other people with the support group, said that the German law &quot;will support&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> The daughter Barats, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but it has a violation of sexual development under the name &quot;syndrome full tolerance to androgens&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="939"> As its androgenic receptors not work properly, at Katie female signs developed. </seg>
<seg id="940"> He has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, in 29 years, Katie is married and studies internship in child psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="943"> &quot;The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions&quot; — Barats said. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He gives them time to make some analyses and to understand the situation, as well as the period before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In that case you as it should be — raise a child, love the child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We don&apos;t need to make a transaction that is nonreversible hasty. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that moves parents because they don&apos;t feel they do well&quot; — she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Ultimately, the child will decide with what floor to him or her is more comfortable — and it is remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="950"> It gives children the chance to make the decision independently. </seg>
<seg id="951"> US Secretary of State: intelligence services sometimes &quot;gone too far&quot; in data collection </seg>
<seg id="952"> The United States Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that in data collection and wiretaps American intelligence services sometimes &quot;gone too far&quot; nevertheless the politician noted that the information on the wiretap of 70 million people that appeared in the news media is not true. </seg>
<seg id="953"> I assure you that innocent people during this process does not tolerate, but an attempt to collect information was. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Yes, in some cases it has gone too far and was unlawful. </seg>

<seg id="969"> Ms. Howells said: &quot;All public was struck, and all shouted cheers and clapped&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="970"> He ran in the sand on the entire length of the arena and although looked so tiny, perfectly made the case. </seg>

<seg id="986"> On Thursday the court of appeal of the federal district has suspended a court order requiring changes to stop-and-search programme of the New York police department and discharged a judge of business. </seg>
<seg id="987"> The court of appeal of the second Circuit of the US announced that the execution of the decisions of the judge Shira Sheyndlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city. </seg>
<seg id="988"> In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution how it implemented a programme for street detention and interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The city filed an appeal to its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including an instruction to appoint a controller to help police station to alter its practices and related training programme. </seg>
<seg id="990"> On Thursday, the court of Appeal heard debate of the parties on the application for a business suspension. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The court of Appeal said the need to remove the judge because it violated the code of conduct for judges of the US and is not counted on the need to avoid bias demonstration, partly because of an interview series in the media and the official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The judge ruled that police violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably turning to black and Hispanic according to the stop-and-search program. </seg>

<seg id="1004"> He said it during communications with readers of the page on &quot;Facebook&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can say definitely that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which is, including, and customs payments. </seg>

<seg id="1007"> And it will mean, as prices should fall. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;It comes to goods that come from EU countries&quot; - was written by Azarov. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be to such direct, it will be indirect. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> But, nevertheless, there too, there should not be a price increases. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Therefore, reports on billboards, which appeared in our country has been quite a lot recently that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, not really true or if more accurately to speak - not at all so &quot;, - Azarov summed up. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Rescue package of $325 million for healthcare in Tasmania </seg>
<seg id="1013"> The federal government insists that the rescue package of $325 million for the weakened health of Tasmania will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend means for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> The federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek said that the Commonwealth is &quot;urgent action&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island nation, a higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> The decision on funding for four years was made after consultation of the government with the independent member of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> &quot;The government proposed a package of the emergency rescue, which we believe will address specific problems, facing staff&quot; — Ms. Plibersek announced today. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The package of $325 million in size includes $31 million to blitz campaign to planned operations. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, would help overcome backlog. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> There is also money for the clinics receiving patients _without in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after a hospital, the training of medical experts, mental health services and introducing systems of personal electronic health records in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &quot;These investments will go on the ideas expressed by the best doctors realization how best to help health system of Tasmania&quot; — Ms. Plibersek said. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in the regime of strict accountability and responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Staff will need to support the current funding levels to receive funds from the Commonwealth, and monthly to report on where it spends these additional resources. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> The commission of three people will be created to make sure staff provides services as effectively as possible and is more effective. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr. Wilkie declared today that $325 million will solve nothing, &quot;if they are not followed by original reform which will put health system of Tasmania on steadier basis&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Nevertheless, he praised the government to respond to its request for an urgent assistance with which he first turned to the prime minister at the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I hope that the package of the federal help will promote considerably to a conclusion of health system of this staff from critical condition&quot; — Mr. Wilkie told. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the state government, these additional electoral procedures largely offset recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But the federal opposition representative on health Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s statement is &quot;a decision similar to the adhesive plaster&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;The reason why we are here, is that Labour state government pulled out $430 million from a health system&quot; — he said ABC TV television companies. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the state government tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million, it is impossible to pretend that it is good news. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from a rescue package would not be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Cry of despair of a voter Obama </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for president Obama twice, sharing the hope for the possibility of change </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He said that Obama allowed obstructionism of republicans to nullify commendable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> The obstruction cannot excuse problems with the website of the health system reformed by Obama attacks of UAVs </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Memories of the Obama campaign are of 2008 a sad reminder of what could be </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Nathaniel P. Morris — the second-year student of medicine at Harvard university. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I read terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me at the time of sadness at the second year of medical school and will allow me to have a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It is called &quot;audacity to win&quot; and these are memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When I stop writing reports on my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book returns me when the policy encouraged millions of people, and speeches could capture spirit. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The victory was impressive, and hosts of news programmes have pause for reflection of this historic moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates wept with happiness, and my parents protected all newspapers that only they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> The young team of strategists had to come to the White house, and people were prepared to change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> In an effective date of Obama in the post in 2008, its level of support made 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Return to the present is rude awakening as wrest from dream. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> In the years since I lowered the first ballot, changes have been made. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It was that I could not even imagine. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I give Obama commended for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable health care to the conclusion of our military from Iraq, cancellation of the rule &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&quot;, Osama bin Laden&apos;s murder. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Indeed, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closing of the base in Guantánamo among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after innumerable times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it before colleagues and peers, I finished the explanation that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The obstruction of republicans cannot explain leave to wiretap of foreign leaders or the strike of UAVs on innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> He cannot explain data collection on privacy of Americans by the National security agency or persecution of the debunkers opening illegal actions of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> He could not explain the deaths of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki out of court or non-compliance with limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that the efforts used by the White house to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive … since the Nixon administration&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And recently it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I don&apos;t know whether it to me to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Whether I had to understand at the age of 18 years, what the management can contradict political campaigns which precede it? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It is clear that the work of elective office is not a predictable programme of action as our public dialogue will be formed by opposition political party and such random events as massacre in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Nevertheless by all examples which are listed above by me it is visible that they substantially were own choice of administration. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And it what bothers me most. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I once again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney submitted incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed as if he is unable to decide on their own policies or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I believed that in the second time Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, will meet the expectations that we have heard in such a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, this week when Obama&apos;s ratings have dipped below 45%, it has become much harder to come back in 2008 through this book. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It makes me long for the many commitments have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week, I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton retreat in Obama resounding defeat in primary elections in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At the meeting, according to an analysis of the reasons for non-implementation it has told staff that they should return to normal and remain loyal to the end. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I wish that we return our call — he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> — We must remember who we are &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Five years have passed, Mr. president, and I absolutely agree with you. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> The opinions expressed in this commentary belong only to Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> In Egypt, the first freely elected president took the oath </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohamed Morsi took the oath, but the date of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of political struggle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised &quot;new Egypt&quot; when took the oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> On the inauguration before the Supreme constitutional court of Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the courthouse on the banks of the Nile built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We seek a better future, new Egypt and the second republic&quot; — Morsi during a ceremony which is broadcast live on state television said. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability&quot; — Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, fundamentalist group, which the majority of 84 years of its existence was a proscribed organisation serving as a target for tough action of successive governments said. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small train soon after the 11th morning local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential hydor times of Mubarak, the movement was halted for only a short time to move his convoy in the usually lively road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although Morsi derided as not charismatic &quot;spare wheel&quot; of &quot;Brothers&quot;, his personal prestige shot up from the moment of his victory and Friday statement in which he tried to present itself (himself) as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to finish this uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state&quot; — Morsi wearing a blue suit case with a red tie, to judges in the room lined with wooden panels, where he took the oath said. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> After Morsi went to Cairo university, where he had to deliver his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> An official reception with the army orchestra which fulfilled the national anthem during which he stood at attention &quot;quietly&quot; was extended to it. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> There was a military figure field marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> Its arrival was met by the slogan &quot;Army and the People — One Hand&quot; which was chanted by hundreds of audience in the main lecture hall of university. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo university in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamic student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that completed authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year arose and promised to return the powers of the president of which his position was denied by the Council of War, which accepted cases from the deposed leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But having agreed to take the oath of office before the courts, but not before parliament as it is adopted, it carries out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Morsi&apos;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools designed to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> School courses of English literature would require that students studied at least one play by Shakespeare, the novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> At examination &quot;extracurricular texts&quot; will also be presented to encourage more extensive reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> The integrated course of English literature and language will be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015, pupils will be obliged to move individual final examination in the language, with emphatic recommendations of the choice of English literature as separate examination. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Department of Education has to issue new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow — to the first themes subjected to radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> He will make changes to other major themes next year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Separately, the regulator in the area of examinations of OFQUAL will submit a revised structure of final exams of high school, with new evaluation system and smaller volume of term papers. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Acting in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gouv told that &quot;the broad consensus that we have to reform our system of examinations was reached to return public trust&quot;, insisting that school final examinations will be &quot;more difficult, more ambitious and more strict&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that English schools spend less time for mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during the quarter) than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For comparison — Australian schools give on average 143 hours a year, and in Singapore students enrolled nearly 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Though formal requirement will not find more time in the schedule for mathematics, sources in the coalition were told that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics in combination with the increased coefficient in the table of ratings, will serve most likely as incentive for providing additional training by schools in this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> In the curriculum more attention will be paid to &quot;tasks from real life&quot;, including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football - discord reason? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma in &quot;An open rostrum&quot; policies and experts said about how to preserve the national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals also such were delivered: prohibit football in the North Caucasus, because from that game - one scandals and strife. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled about recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to decrease &quot;tensions degree in society&quot; politicians and media must be correct in statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Perhaps he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the shows, threatened to surround the Caucasus, with barbed wire if you don&apos;t want to limit birth rates... </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All speakers said and the measures for the management of migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize the relationship between the peoples of Russia that gave discussion confusion. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev - &quot;the model conflict that could be predicted&quot; but &quot;at us is responsible for these issues too many people and organs&quot; and too many cooks spoil the broth. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which has long against migrants were practised by Europe, according to the public man, failed, and we should look for the way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> The historian Yuri Petrov heightened expectations of a new single textbook of history. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;Still it is necessary to create a manual on cultural history of the people of the country that schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan and vice versa&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov proposed to criminalize &quot;calls to dismember Russia&quot;: &quot;If the US to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and will provide 20 years of prison! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky has struggled &quot;not to incite&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, he accused journalists who submit painful and compelling national problems for public discussion of everything: &quot;In the midst of controversy you never know, you can tell you! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev right there advised journalists to conclude &quot;charter&quot; and to agree to engage in talk about it clearly, and then the same obligations can also assume politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is installed, Mr. Vasiliev said. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It gave the law that gives on regional and municipal authorities responsible for international Peace in their territory as an example. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for the act: in it there is no &quot;clear ideas that such adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms, and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Funds, themes will treated differently the volume of these powers. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> In addition municipalities have no staff needed to address these complex issues, there are no funds, and the centre does not provide policy advice that they could use to them... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of the State Duma&apos;s Committee on Nationalities Gadzhimet safaraliev invited to create special department with the terrible name &quot;Department of Homeland Security&quot; that would deal with national policy. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valery tishkov, in the 1990s headed the same department subsequently abolished opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It is enough to have at the federal level of the special person, &quot;the minister without portfolio&quot; to which it would be possible to contact if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We are on the razor-edge, shells are torn by a row, very important to representatives of different ethnicities and religions together to oppose provocation, and the work was to get decent information support&quot; - the representative of ROC on links with society Vsevolod Chaplin said. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Any neutrality of the state to dangerous ideologies, religious including to be, in his view, should not. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Here Oleg Nilov took discussion to the unexpected course: &quot;More talented people than in Chechnya and Dagestan, it remains to be seen, but they are pushed not that way, not on that road&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;Not that road&quot; is the development of football: &quot;That the footballer was beaten all the crowd, flags burn, comrades throw stones of each other... </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe we don&apos;t need such football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another sport - rugby is called... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;Equal it will not be in the world in this sport! &quot;is a member of A Just Russia warmly said. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> In the Caucasus nobody will play rugby! - right there Mr. Zhirinovsky interfered. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You still offer curling to them! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> It is necessary to know national characteristics, all the same as &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; to offer it to the Georgian &quot;... </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl on the stands representatives of the Moscow club - have distinguished themselves in wild behaviour during the game with local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football should be banned across the country... </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Confessions of National security agency strengthen paranoia of corporations to the state surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> In the warm afternoon at the end of August, the helicopter of the German police flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> Under the instruction of Federal service for the protection of the constitution (bfvs), maintenance of internal intelligence of Germany, his task was to photograph the rooftop of representation of the US, which is less than 5 km from the European central bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> The German media say that bfvs hoped to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions caused negotiations between the US and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Klepper, director of National intelligence of the US, in September, reassured that the US do not use the foreign intelligence &quot;for the theft of trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But since Edward Snowden — the contract employee who was the unmasker — started publishing a treasury of secrets of the intelligence of the United States, European governments and business leaders are not sure any more, if he can take the director, the word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports about the National Security agency of the US monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in cloud service providers of the US including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by surveillance of the state to new heights. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> News that the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel was heard, perhaps about 10 years is the last straw. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the most powerful man of Europe can become a target, of course, potential targets are also business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the United States and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think it is likely that these data are used to mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany must wake up&quot; — Oliver Gryun, president of the association BITMi, which is small and medium IT companies in Germany says. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies are confident that the US now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency Eee. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> In all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, there was no evidence that the US transferred trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians expressed concern that the EU is not enough some opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce their dependence on the US. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Entrepreneurs are skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the German parliament said that we must create the German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can only close your eyes and slowly open them again … </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;This is not an option&quot; — Gasso Plattner, president of the German company software vendor for business of SAP says. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a need for powerful European IT industry, you shouldn&apos;t let it must been lost more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Everything except the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> And yet the scope and technical development of agencies on espionage of the US became renowned for Snowden&apos;s revelations were shock for some companies that used to think the biggest risk of surveillance is China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Big shift occurs in the cloud where heads of the European companies sold better that the data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction, and thus potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to a study by trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-US participants dropped plans to use services of the cloud provider, who is in the US after the exposure of the American programme for the intellectual analysis of data of Prism. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Jim Sneyb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: &quot;We see that consumers ask a new issue that did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they physically will remain in that jurisdiction &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German leaders claim that the latest reports — it only confirm that they already knew that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets, and, therefore, these data should be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> That there is an economic espionage — not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> It always took place. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;It was the subject of discussion, many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy&quot; — Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF said. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, and we also spy on them as it is in our national interests — to protect our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Leaders of corporations usually don&apos;t like to boast of those responses which they pledged as it can provide dignity to the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In large companies, the thought that to take a free flash card at an exhibition or to leave your laptop without supervision in a hotel basement, it at least unwisely was acquired for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Hakenberg, a board member of the Audi carmaker, said that many years, it is standard practice - to collect mobile phones before council meetings that they could not be used as taps. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The federal Protective service of the German constitution recommends that the heads of companies to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Prepaid mobile phones jump out later. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in a particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;Small and medium-sized firms often do not have experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access&quot; — cautions in the report of bfvs. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> The US warn their own companies on economic espionage from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> The national Intelligence U.S. report in February placed France, together with Russia and Israel in the second row of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, endorses The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> A board member of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are most worse&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French agency of an internal investigation into the DCRI reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;Services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on allies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The Los Angeles international airport was evacuated because of the shooting in one of terminals. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 WCS). </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Protection evacuated staff and passengers of the second and third terminal. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to preliminary data, the man had fired from a rifle of high power. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Some people, including a member of the Transportation Security Administration of the US, were wounded. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> The police returned fire and detained an attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> He was lightly wounded. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Tripodi denies that is subject to Obeid&apos;s influence </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The former minister of the work of the New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the person involved in the investigation of anti-corruption supervisory authority of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The former minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refutes modify the order of the lease primorskiy objects at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who was secretly owning shares in three real estate on state-owned land. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended the ​ ​ investigate whether Mr. Obeid at several ministers of staff lobbied extension leases for Serkyyular Ki, where the family Obeydov owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing of the tender after the expiry of their action in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> It investigated claims now that Mr. Tripodi knew about clandestine involvement of Mr. Obeid in real estate, after the testimony given by a former deputy head of the administration of Mr. Tripodi Lynn Eshpoul on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> For several years of the discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease was set to open competition. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Tenants were against it, and also wanted longer periods of rent. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> In 2009 leases for businesses on Serkyyular Ki, which brought to the family Obeydov about $2.5 million a year, were extended without exposure to open competition. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Mr. Tripodi, who was the minister for infrastructure and transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported open competitions. </seg>

<seg id="1221"> Under the control of the state now and share construction. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> The law protecting from fraudsters was adopted by regional Duma in final reading. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The document was not born from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In our region 4.5 million people suffered from dishonest builders. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Problems of most managed to be addressed. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Incidentally, the new law registers the rights and responsibilities for all parties to share construction. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh region duma, said: &quot;It is no secret that in this area, the abuse bound by that, in its 98th year shareholders same acquired, and in the 2000s, the same shareholders too began. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="1230"> The regional parliament adopted such law not only under pressure of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region, although take away. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> So, last year on the migratory account became a little more than 100,000 foreigners. </seg>

<seg id="1235"> Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh region duma, said: &quot;They violated the law, but are not criminals. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Courts are not, and you want to deport - they should be contained somewhere. </seg>

<seg id="1249"> On Wednesday, the centers for Disease control and prevention published a list of recommendations for control of food allergies in children in schools. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is the first list of similar recommendations, which was issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies grows. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Now one of 20 children in the US has food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> The centers for Disease control and prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007. </seg>

<seg id="1254"> It also encourages schools to hold adrenaline reserves — most often for injection automatic medical syringe of EpiPen — for assistance is used in potentially fatal anaphylaxis. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> State legislatures made changes to regulations recently to allow schools to do adrenaline reserves with less hassle. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> The notice also contains a list of the typical symptoms described by children who had an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Children can say: &quot;It feels as though something pokes on my tongue&quot;, &quot;the feeling that is always on the lips of me hair&quot; or &quot;language pinches&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The Kenyan press is appalled by the provocative media law </seg>
<seg id="1259"> &quot;This terrible place, is also the reason for the question: what may prevent destruction of judicial independence by Parliament in the future? &quot;— the newspaper reported, calling the law is unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> &quot;The law very harsh and punitive, and we reject it&quot; — Cyrus Kamau, the managing director of Capital Group - the parent company CapitalFM into which one of the independent radio stations that are most respected in Kenya and the news site enters said. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> He said the new judicial authority on media &quot;will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government&quot; and restrictions on content and advertising will do much harm to the situation of Kenya in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> &quot;I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to deputies&quot; — he told. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> According to the The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government &quot;to take media stranglehold&quot; and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya &quot;received a serious blow&quot; and criticized the bill as &quot;draconian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen the national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the mall Westgate. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Kenyan media drew the wrath of authorities, broadcast of surveillance cameras, where troops were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly looting expensive shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The call of the two journalists and an official of the media on interrogation, although the call was cancelled after mass protests of the media was the response of the chief Constable David Kimayo. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Under the new law of the publishing house can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists — to one million with additional risk to be &quot;delisted&quot;, that is to receive a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the penalty was not paid. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> According to Daily Nation, &quot;one has only one penalty to paralyse the majority of FM radio stations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> She also reported that these measures can have devastating effect on the so-called &quot;a lively blogosphere&quot; of Kenya. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Politicians understand that, with the media silent, they will be able to do whatever they will take in head, with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> &quot;Nobody ever learns&quot; — journalist of Nation Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and will return us to hunting and gathering&quot; — he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Kenyan lawmakers were the target of public anger and in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In May, they voted to cancel the reductions appointed by the national commission on salaries and restore the size of the huge salary, component of 532 thousand shillings a month, which are not assessed by taxes — one of the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Investigators check the mistreatment of the child in Biysk </seg>
<seg id="1277"> On 29 October media published a message that the teacher of one of kindergartens in the city of Biysk for training purposes, locked the child in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Now investigators all the circumstances are investigated, and legal assessment is given against members of kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> After the prosecution of Eugene Vasiliev&apos;s bad taste spoke </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Yevgenia Vasilyeva on which person almost a year, the media attention is focused, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both on theft in the Ministry of Defence, and about him personally - the relationship with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, his poetry and about addiction to valuables. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> However, on 1 November, the person involved in the business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot; violated silence. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Said in an interview of Life News of Vasiliev: &quot;Initially, of course, the task was made just one: to pull out of me any negative information concerning the former Defence Minister &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> There was a blackmail in what I have to testify, otherwise I would go to jail. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Today these threats stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Next, we go to court, we will prove his innocence. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> We are confident of victory for 100 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Thus from interview it is possible to draw a conclusion that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyeva was touched by words that at her is unimportant with taste. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Perhaps the statement by the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in a collection of paintings, which was collected by the person involved in the business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot;, forgery, were found means. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Among the seized property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in the deep knowledge of art, got as masterpieces of world painting. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> However, the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after the arrest of these pictures found that they have no artistic value and, quite simply, are cheap imitation &quot;, - Markin in early October noted. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence... </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Then, after all admitted that they from the Ministry of Defence are not stolen, and said to me it is bad with the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments? </seg>
<seg id="1294"> In my opinion, it&apos;s just a lawlessness &quot;- says vasiljeva. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> In response to the question as to whether she would plead guilty while one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to it, Vasiliev said: &quot;Naturally, no. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> There is nothing to recognize in general. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Simply mislead the people, that&apos;s all. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In addition, in response to today&apos;s statement by the RF IC that vasiljeva refrained from dealing with the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer for the person involved announced that he and his client &quot;the investigator made it impossible to get acquainted with the case file&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> What served as a reason to revelations by vasiljeva who is under house arrest, who was still not communicating with the press? </seg>
<seg id="1301"> It is possible how the woman she could not but respond to the charge of bad taste? </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Or the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda claiming a couple of days ago are right, what it &quot;fell even further into trance under house arrest&quot; because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov&apos;s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family fold? </seg>
<seg id="1303"> The famous military observer of &quot;KP&quot; Viktor Baranets in the article &quot;Serdyukov returned to the wife? &quot;wrote: &quot;Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock it may become more talkative during interrogations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Before Vasiliev assumed some allegations of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The defender of &quot;Juventus&quot; Leonardo Bonuchchi will not help the team with the closest match of the championship of Italy with &quot;Parma&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> As reports Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include it in the demand for the game to save before the match of the 4th round of a group round of the Champions League with &quot;Real&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Also Lichtsteiner, vu Ini and Pepe will not participate in a duel with &quot;Parma&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> And the forward Fabio Quallarella was restored after an injury and is ready to play. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> The British government said the study aimed at improving economic force for Scotland of the project of the railway line HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> The HS2 project involves opening of the high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, from the beginning of the First Stage in 2026 </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The Minister of Transport baroness Kramer noted that the project &quot;will combine Great Britain&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The Minister of Transport Scotland Keith Brown said that it works on the plan, &quot;delighted&quot; with perspective, with the British government. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The first phase will be in the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> When the Second phase was completed, the lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> In June, the government revised estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and the North of England from £32.7 to £Cr $42.6 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The British government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, entrusted to HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements the capacity of railway and reduce the length of travel to Northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> It must include the ability to overcome the way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal on HS2 is to create relatively national network that will make Great Britain and its cities is closer to each other&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> We are developing HS2 because benefits it will bring are enormous. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Without it we will face crisis of capacity in our rail system. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> But the speech also goes on transport communications of cities with each other; Across the UK 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement — good news for Scotland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> On behalf of the Scottish government Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network &quot;clearly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Mr. Brown said: &quot;The high-speed railway has every chance of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railway across the UK&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the establishment of benefit for all and the continuation of the railway line Glasgow — Edinburgh which are already planning the Scottish government. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> I look forward to the consideration of the research results with British ministers next year and joint decision of the next steps. </seg>

<seg id="1402"> As the Izvestia newspaper such amendments to legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the State Duma&apos;s Energy Committee Oleg Mikheyev reports, have already been sent for a conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Under patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand emotional connection of the man with the country, is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, the responsible attitude to his fate, respect for its history and culture. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> As Mikheev indicated, in the domestic law there are penalties for violations of formal signs of the government - the flag and the coat of arms. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Thus, according to a parliamentarian, protection of Russians who feelings can be hurt by a show of both an affront to the state symbols, and other forms of contempt for our country, in the Russian legislation is worked enough. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> It provides the discussions that are developed annually on the eve of the Victory Day when some media-persons *dare* call into question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists as an example. </seg>

<seg id="1408"> Professing in wit and &quot;an alternative view&quot; of history, some publicists reach reasoning that, say, what a pity that cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union! </seg>
<seg id="1409"> I think it is totally unacceptable in a country where pride of history, remained the main &quot;spiritual cement of to&quot; the nation &quot;, Oleg Mikheyev is indignant. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> In addition, according to Mikheev, it is much more patriotic people in Russia than religious, but however, the act recompenses for insulting feelings of believers, and you can offend patriotic feelings with near impunity. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> According to the people&apos;s deputy, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings towards extremist activities and to make the appropriate punishment in the 282nd article of the Criminal code. </seg>

<seg id="1418"> To control KIO there is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists security officers. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> At a meeting of the OP Workgroup on forming the KIO I offered to make a selection criterion experience of human rights activities. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> &quot;It was not accepted, and emerging lists, without having developed criteria&quot;, Valery borschev says. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Borschev - the current chairman of the Moscow supervisory commission and the Association of independent observers - the All-Russian structure of the human rights defenders dealing with prison problems. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In the suspension by State Duma deputy from &quot;Apple&quot; he developed the law governing KIO. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> The Council of OP should vote for structures of KIO in 43 parts of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Less than one thousand people interested claim to 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not organize because of the absence of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> OP promises to organize a donabor on vacancies. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> PMC of Moscow - one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new structure instead of 20 there will be 40 participants. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> According to borschev, in the current capital structure commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security officers, and in the version that is on a vote in OP, the ratio changes on 17 to 23. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> With 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the capital commission. </seg>

<seg id="1431"> Borschev believes that security officers by appointing the chairman of the KIO, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable so human rights defenders do not kick a collective exit from the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In their view, promotion of security officers is coordinated by a member of the KIO Anton Tsvetkov title &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - the advocacy organization for security forces. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> &quot;I don&apos;t eat babies for breakfast&quot;, said RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> It denies that lobbies the promotion of any lists and said it was not going to interfere with defenders to visit the arrested opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested, for which list now vote in OP. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He believes publication of information by borschev as pressure form. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> The likely success of human rights activists - the planned changes in the leadership of the Chelyabinsk KIO. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Her former managers will be discharged because of last year&apos;s Kopeisk unrest. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the public chamber concluded that the office of the local commission ignored problems of prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> And here the KIO of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security officers. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> From new lists the human rights activist chairman of the local commission &quot;was missing&quot; but there was one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the federal public chamber deleted it for unethical behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Borschev believes the lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions as &quot;as revenge for Kopeysk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Nadezhda Tolokonnikova&apos;s revelations did not affect KIO of Mordovia, which believe &quot;power&quot;: only one human rights activist wanted to get to the new structure, and at her did not even accept documents for competition. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The member of council of OP Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that voted against the offered list as he is revolted by a situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> It sent out a position to other council members. </seg>

<seg id="1607"> Rosbalt agency deprived of the status of the media to verbal abuse </seg>
<seg id="1608"> On 31 October, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the licence to register Rosbalt agency - &quot;Tape&quot; writes. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Drew Roscomnadzor on deprivation of the agency of the status of media - for the systematic and gross violations of the media law. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> During the process unpleasant precedent has been created: the court said that it was possible to close the media, in fact had refused to the publication the right to nominate counter-reply. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> What is &quot;Rosbalt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> JSC Rosbalt News Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> In the coming years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Also submissions to the countries of the former USSR work for the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Since 2001 &quot;Rosbalt&quot; develop and operate as federal information and analysis agency. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Thus &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always busy quite specific niche: notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies have been the centre of exclusive publications of the agency (and make still). </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Talk about the proximity of the publication to power continued throughout the existence of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Along with that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had extensive base of sources in various departments, such assumptions were spoken well also with that the project Natalya was at the head of Chaplin - Victor Cherkesov&apos;s wife. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Thus Chaplina&apos;s role in the office of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is not fully clear: most often it is called &quot;project manager&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The director general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Recently &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the ratings of federal media - either on the quoting nor on the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In October, the agency took the 25th place in the top in attendance at sites of the Russian media under LiveInternet. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500,000 viewings), monthly - up to three million unique visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Among the most popular materials for the past five months - a note on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the singer of King and Clown group, pogroms in capital Biryulev. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The conflict of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; to Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law that banned journalists obscene abuse came into force. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Department found the forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the site of agency (&quot;The Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;The Pussy Riot was profaned by oil derricks&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1628"> The parties have further describe differently. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Roscomnadzor on the basis of the found videos accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; gross and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action to select the licence at the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; said that claims of the division are illegal: first, clips were not editorials, secondly, obscene words in them were masked, and, thirdly, right after a warning clips were removed from the site. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Representatives of the agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in world court - and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints continued. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But already the 25th the magistrate decided not in favour of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: editor-in-chief - Alexander savelyev had been found guilty of breaching the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles, per 10,000 for each movie. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Obviously, it also determined the hearing outcome in Moscow City Court - if you give up the idea that the outcome could be prejudged even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> On 31 October, the court decided to reverse the certificate of registration of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; while effectively deprived agency of the status of the media. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> It is impossible to say that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during this opposition remained alone. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> The agency was supported by members of the State Duma (the petition to the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of the CPRF). </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The illegality of closure of the publication was announced by the head of the Russian Union of journalists Abhisit Vejjajiva, chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Paul Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on human rights Mikhail Fedotov. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Office of Roscomnadzor even provided it some assurance that business will not reach licence revocation. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The trial of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; showed: under whose jurisdiction, it is safer to be to media in Russia today - a big issue. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> The gene for a speech proved to be a catalyst for formation of synapses </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Scientists from the Johns Hopkins University and Medical school Maunt-Sinai found protein through which &quot;the speech gene&quot; Foxp2 has out the function, encouraging the development of new links between neurons. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Study is published in Science, on the site of the loggingyou can read the summary. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The gene of Foxp2 is the first known gene that function is directly related to the speech. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It was possible to establish its role in 2001, thanks to the discovery of the family from several people who could not say correctly the word and sometimes even didn&apos;t understand each other. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Scientists found that at family members in the gene of Foxp2, but was broken how it is performing the function, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> In the new study biologists showed that at least part of the Foxp2 functions exercises as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the brain, speech associated with formation. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Exercise it it thanks to another gene, SRPX2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The latter was found in a search of the factors that stimulate the production of synapses. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes found authors, with only on its activities viyat Foxp2. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> That SRPX2 really affect actual call or vocalizations, scientists confirmed in an experiment to little mice. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> When in animals activities of the gene was artificially reduced, they yelled at unit with mother less. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> If the activity of the gene was restored, also the frequency of the made sounds was restored. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Earlier on mice communication with the actual call or vocalizations of Foxp2 was also shown. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Animals who entered the human copy of the gene, arquebuse are more active and at a lower rate than ordinary mice. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Still, however, scientists do not know whether the work of the Foxp2 and, accordingly, SRPX2 operated by it is associated with a purely &quot;mechanical&quot; properties of formation of sounds or thinner processes. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Ponomarev left &quot;Just Russia&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1658"> As a parliamentarian said, he applied to Novosibirsk regional office of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> According to its charter, it automatically means that Ponomarev left ranks of &quot;spravedross&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> We sit, we drink tea... </seg>
<seg id="1661"> &quot;For some reason, many want to see the picture&quot; Ilya Ponomarev put Party Membership Card on the Table &quot;but there is nothing of that kind landmark&quot; - the deputy commented on the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Ponomarev noted that remains good relations with the regional office of &quot;socialist-revolutionaries&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse the mandate of a member of the State Duma. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> He explained that, despite the desertion of the party, it remains a member of the faction and under the law cannot leave it. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Reports of Ilya Ponomarev&apos;s intention to leave Just Russia party appeared on 30 October. </seg>

<seg id="1667"> Want the ice cream shining in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="1668"> A British businessman created the world&apos;s first ice cream shining in the dark using the Medusa. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the sea beast to develop a shining food. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> He came to this idea, having read the scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced researchers in China chemically to recreate the shining protein. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, making the pH in protein and forcing him to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Chris says that as ice cream starts shining when reacts to heat of a mouth, it means that the more you lick, the it becomes brighter. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Charlie, founder of the company to manufacture Lick Me, I Tasty ice cream, says: &quot;This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning if you talk about products, so you get approximately 2 g of substance at £200&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> The protein, which we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> So when your mouth warms protein, it will increase the pH and ice cream will start glow. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to submit it to the Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that I did because the glow of Medusa is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> So each ball cost me to be approx £140. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> But it quite tastes good. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The experimental company of Charlie located in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But his next creation should be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> He said: &quot;I really want to develop invisible ice cream&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> It is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals of that ice cream is, but I think we will find a way to do so. </seg>

<seg id="1893"> Syria destroyed all declared facilities for the production of chemical weapons, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons recognized. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This first phase of disarmament completed Damascus a day before the deadline. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Before November 1 Syria had to destroy the production and other ancillary facilities intended for the preparation of chemical warfare agents to use, the BBC reports. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The destruction of stockpiles of chemical agents or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to the representative of the OPCW, now toxic agents are in a sealed vaults. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, during a chemical attack died, according to the US, more than 1,400 people. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The main task of inspectors were not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to do more chemical weapons - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment of ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> Will now carefully monitor these receptacles to prevent their repair. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The next milestone - the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians have to agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of chemical agents. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> There is a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where they will be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide to that end, the equipment? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian statements would be scrutinised by western intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They are willing to advise the inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The US believe that this attack was carried out by active armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist that the work of the Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - according to the agreement brokered by Russia to destroy or make into an unusable state all production facilities shells, poison gas and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now that this stage is passed, the destruction of chemical weapons, which is already available for the Syrian army must be the next step. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is anticipated that in this arsenal there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve toxic agents, skin and blister mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> It is necessary for its destruction that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to begin agreed to a timetable for action - on it two weeks are taken away. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The head of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith said the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of equipment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;They don&apos;t have the possibility of the message continued production, or a mixture of chemical weapons are now&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In a statement of the OPCW stated that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that plants producing shells and toxic agents were either destroyed or are put out of commission. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out there inspection, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by professionals of the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the destruction of infrastructure on the production of chemical weapons &quot;was particularly challenging&quot; as it was necessary to work in conditions of the ongoing conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> At the beginning of October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, time to celebrate it at the inspectors had not yet - they were too employed. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> George kerewan: the gap with Europe gives Scots selection </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another horror story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> The turn of stories about the passport control in Bervike and the border with barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s Wall comes. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits from freer movements over the other Europe, although. then is predictable — it did not appear in headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Nor did not indicate that EU Member States spend a lot of time to make the formal rules as it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> As Scotland is not currently included to the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what she really wanted from Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So it is a story that is not merit attention. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And such old that it has become a fossil: for the first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Still, there is an interesting point lost when retelling the ancient fairy tale. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why, in general, independent Scotland should carry out the orders of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> These are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With eurocrisis the Europe project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In all European Union, the parties opposed to the EU or to cancel the euro as the single currency growth momentum. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany, the party of the F-word &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; — established only in this the year - coming from nowhere and received almost five million votes on September federal election, and in fact displacing &quot;the Free democrats&quot; (analog of ours of &quot;the Liberal democrats&quot;) from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There was always an internal opposition to the plan to establish federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European central bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through maintaining the single currency led many people to believe that the European project gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments work at excessive budget deficits — it was only fair in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In fact, the eurosystem blocked the members on the exchange rates enabling German exporters. then German politicians and want to save. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency Southern Europe appears in before disadvantage on manufacturing capabilities compared with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only the remedy is — to cut salaries and public spending that is actively supported by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Behind the current problems of the budget and monetary there is a deeper problem of productive abilities of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of a package of measures on &quot;green&quot; energy, imposed by Brussels - code meaning subsidies of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry drew double for electricity four times more for gas than in the US. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> It paralizuyushche adverse price terms as we saw in Greyndzhmuta. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing salaries in the world will stop the crushing defeat of cheap shale gas of the US over the European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result was brewing rebellion, particularly in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on a par with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin does not need Paris, as in means of obtaining political legitimacy anymore, and has already imposed its own economic policies to Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in distress. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> Result floor-right, speaking against the EU Marine Le Pen&apos;s party &quot;National front&quot; just won a crucial by-election, releasing the ruling party of the Socialists to third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;Front&quot; is the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes now — a timely warning to British labourists that it cannot be assumed that splits in the right will automatically affect in favour of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What Le Pen with the newfound popularity among the French white working class does? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create the block in the European parliament against the EU and against the single currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If. and it is very likely — parties opposed to the EU will receive support in these elections, such block will be able to reach for the first time a dominant position in the European parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something vague &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; that was encouraging to General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and some economies, dependent on it, can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I assume that Britain is removed from the project, hoping to approach with the US. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates probable that Britain will go unnoticed by the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In that situation, it leaves Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become the region (in fact) to Small England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, in addition, to send Berlin and Brussels to devils. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed for more free European location, provided that we will keep the currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to non-federated Europe of nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise, we should consider repeat the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The government of the Scottish national Party in Scotland are — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to the cuts in spending proposed (and implemented) the Labour chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Tories and liberal democrats that had arisen thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> It would now be ridiculous to Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early puberty: Ageing earlier </seg>
<seg id="2044"> African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers, show research. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The trend towards early sexual maturity is not so expressed at boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge — a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Whether the mother should be scared if her daughter vestiges of the mammary gland start emerge and raise pubic hair in 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics this week to Orlando, Florida, the children&apos;s endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend much time, soothing parents - typically, this does not mean rapid approach of a full sexual maturity&quot; — Kaplovitts said. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor appear at girls before. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But there was only a slight shift under the age of menarche (the first periods) in the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States middle age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;After the breast starting to mature, passes at least two to three years at menarche&quot; — Kaplovitts, who is also the author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls said: how to cope with this widespread problem &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time — the most accurate check how puberty will progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Discussion that represents the actual puberty is, but it is considered &quot;premature&quot; when the breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will be slowed or stopped — him that the pediatrician may carefully trace. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Faster progression can form the basis for analyses at an endocrinologist delete serious problems, such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are procedures to delay early periods and to prevent another investigation: premature ageing of bones that could eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child&apos;s age, the level of development, growth and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psycho-social aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplovitts is careful with drugs, but acknowledges that &quot;suppress puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Other big problem is clear: parents just don&apos;t want their very young daughters had periods. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how will they cope with hygiene issues&quot; — Kaplovitts said. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock&quot; — one woman at which daughter of periods began in 10 years recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were signs and we talked about periods, it was not emotionally ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> He came home from school frightened and upset that it first among the girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are a lot of advertised theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are guilty of milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> At boys - as in girls: puberty comes first. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplovitts argues that the foundation that has the most weight is an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat on the body with puberty terms. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other data support this conclusion, but there are a lot of other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Around the world early puberty is influenced, most likely, by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Still puzzle: Although boys have facial hair and on lobok appear at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as at girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors involved in the AARP conference confirmed the complexity of this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The emergence of spots and pubic hair meets even in infants and children of the nursery age. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We must be careful how we define true puberty&quot; — Dr. Lawrence Silverman, the children&apos;s endocrinologist in children&apos;s hospital of Goriyeb to Morristaun, New Jersey said. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the paediatrician how to speak with the child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;This may mean earlier than anticipated conversation&quot; — Kaplovitts explained. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls who bloom early, need a confirmation that even when that happens before put, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2109"> Some bankers tried to diminish the gravity of the situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid currency market can almost be manipulated, but senior traders say it is not always right. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> According to senior trader, despite the vast amount of daily auction in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity among different trading platforms and greater use of the internal platforms by banks means that &quot;you can start affecting the market for very small price&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2443"> At pawnbrokers in Singapore things go well, while the middle class experiences difficulties </seg>
<seg id="2444"> In a pawn shop in the mall Bendemir in Singapore janani Amirtkhalinga puts a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay school fees for his daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;My husband and I just bought a house so all my money is invested there&quot; — ms. Amirtkhalinga says. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Although she earns S $3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband too works, it is not enough monthly income of the family, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Indeed, demand — where the amount of debt of households grows in different parts of south-east Asia - is such that ValueMax where it executes a transaction, this week became the third Lombard registered on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The loan on the security of jewellery — it not only quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirtkhalinga) but also is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Usually pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly higher than 15.4% proposed in the office of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with industry in the same shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of wages and could provide loans faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Therefore, millions of people across the region address in pawnbrokers as families feel pressure because of the increase in the cost of living and rapid growth of debt of households and consumer debt. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in developed economies, families grip low and average income in pawnbrokers to offset the decline of income in the process of slowing growth of their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> This week Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the rating agency, reported raising in the family credit shoulder, largely because of growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for solvency of Asian banks. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of debt of households to gross domestic product in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Malaysia led the list of 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week hardly left technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> On Thursday data showed a continued fall in exports and weakening of consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> &quot;The essence of that with an increase in prices people in the middle and lower part [the scale of income] will look for ways to supplement their income, where will only be able&quot; — tells Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Record high prices of gold in the past two years strengthened haste with which people put their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to get money for the family jewellery. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> In Singapore, some 70% of the things put in 200 lombard paragraphs of the city-state are gold products. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> People say: &quot;Price of gold looks good, let&apos;s put a gold chain of grandmother and we&apos;ll get it back next month&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnbrokers of EasyMoney witnessed the growth of the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Growth in lombard business is such that ValueMax, operator of the office in Bendemire and 15 others same in Singapore, plans to extend not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia too, Yeakh Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax says. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The company will finance the extension, using 60 per cent from S $66 million attracted this week as a result of IPOs on stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> While some creditors led to criticism fired because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeakh said that the pawn shop not only offers cheaper fares than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> &quot;Customers put subjects they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households&quot; — she says. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> The mortgage wins more and more public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, provided funding. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> And thus use pawnbrokers not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Rich people in Singapore also use offices of ValueMax, putting gold bars or Rolex that can give to 60 per cent of their acquisition cost cash. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> We see clients from all sectors of society. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> &quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short term for commercial projects or investment, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary money problems&quot; — ms. Yeakh says. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> They sometimes simply need money very quickly. </seg>

<seg id="2474"> Bashkiria in government procurement interventions can put grains up for sale no earlier than the beginning of 2014, the Minister of Agriculture of the republic Nicholas Kovalenko said. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Today market prices are such that they do not encourage sale in intervention fund. </seg>

<seg id="2477"> &quot;Probably grain will be put up for sale, after New year&quot;, he said at yesterday&apos;s press conference. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> The minister recalled that in the current year crops of crops on the crop&apos;s eve of 2013 was 3.1 million hectares, including areas of grain - 1.7 million hectares, 3.3% more than last year. </seg>

<seg id="2490"> They managed to seize the intruder who tried to flee from the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Staff of south-eastern LU Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs carry out an inspection. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The question of bringing proceedings Rshatsya, senior reviewer of the direction of the information and public relations for south-east LU Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on transport Sergei Olkhovik reported. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The Russian security officers do not know of fraternal Circle group - novye Izvestia </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Wrote about it INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> &quot;Following media there were reports of deposit by the US Treasury of Leps into checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate &apos;sister Circle&apos;, we saw all databases, but the group does not find&quot;, the negotiator of the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> In his view, the spread of this information helps to uphold the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly working abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> As wrote earlier, yesterday, the US Treasury published a list of alleged members of a criminal group &quot;sister Circle&quot; on the site. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Among them well as the Russian singer Grigory Leps was called. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> It appears in the list as &quot;Grisha&quot;, laid out the day before. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> They coincide with data from the popular Russian performer. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Are specified the exact name - Gregory Lepsevridze, a creative alias, venue and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In addition Leps, five more people are mentioned there. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> Of the US are confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on the Phuket island carried for bandits money by their order. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A photo of the singer is attached to this message and all its data that are true are specified. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Moreover, Leps really bought recently, the house on Phuket. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> In the department noted that they intend to impose sanctions on Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Entering the man in black lists of the U.S. Treasury entails freezing of its assets to the US and a ban on business contacts with it of people living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> The assistant Lepsa Miami Serikova stated that any notices to the singer did not do: &quot;It is difficult to answer the question whether that is Gregory about whom all speak now in connection with the scandal in the U.S.&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> All that knows Leps is evidence of mass media. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> Officially to him personally there were no notifications, although I don&apos;t know whether they are in such cases. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> &quot;And, of course, it all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, is surprising and unexpected&quot;, she said RIA-Novosti. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> According to her on Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but as endorses the U.S. Treasury, on the Thai island it really has a house. </seg>

<seg id="2515"> Black box at you in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> As American designers of roads try to find money to repair the scattered highway system, many are starting to see a decision in the small black box, which is clearly linked to the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices tracking everyone proyezzhayemy the motorist mile and transferring this information to officers are at the centre of a controversial attempt to improve outdated system of funding of America&apos;s highways made by planners in Washington and staff. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Typically boring arena of planning of highways suddenly generated intense debate and picturesque alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying to ensure the right to use small boxes to the government to track number proyezzhayemy you miles, and perhaps even where you pass them - and uses then this information in making tax accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Movement of tea drinking shocked. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And while congress cannot agree, continue yet, or not, some states are not going to wait. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They reflect how over the next decade, you can switch to a system in which drivers pay for each mile of the road which they pass. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists already took these black boxes, some of which have function of satellite tracking on testing. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> It is necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;It is not an issue on which we can have an option&quot;, – Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of Governments of Southern California who is preparing plans at the first of track by the state government of miles, proyezzhayemy each California motorist, for 2025 said. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Technology for this purpose already are. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> This need is compounded by the lack of funds at Government Fund for the construction of motorways funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans do not buy a lot of gasoline as before any more. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars are more miles on a gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, did not raise 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians don&apos;t want to impose a tax even one cent at the high price of petrol. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;The gas tax simply cannot be saved&quot;, – Lee Mannich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota said. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In its staff has been found on cars of 500 tracking devices to test system of mileage payment recently. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;It will be the best alternative in the long term&quot;, – he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Beggar call it a mileage user payment. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Unsurprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals as through taxes it would be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the burden of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Planners in California look closely at this system during develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (a republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of transport committee of the House, said he too believes the system as the most viable long-term option. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Supporters of the free market in Reason fund of also delighted that will force drivers to pay for every mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It is not just a tax, which will go to a black hole&quot;, – Adrian Moore, vice president for political affairs of Reason said. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People directly pay for what they receive. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of Transport of us who in 2011 urged congress to move towards the mileage payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The U.S. senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million in which some 10,000 cars would take part last year. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of the rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life often have to be many miles to get to work or to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Some states and cities, however, go on this path independently. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon where to attend the largest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are involved. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will pay staff to run miles instead of a tax on gasoline soon. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York, it is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> And the coalition of I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies as they will be able to implement these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept was not universally recognized. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers have recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can monitor each their step. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;Concern about &quot;the big brother&quot; and similar things represents a big problem&quot;, – Alauddin Khan managing questions of strategy and management of efficiency in department of transport of the State of Nevada told. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> It was not that people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When the test was at full speed, the office of the American civil liberties union in Nevada, warned on the website: &quot;It will be very simple to turn these devices into devices of full track&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is one of several states where complex searches of low-cost technology that would allow authorities of the state to maintain account proyezzhayemy the car of miles, but without information about the place and time are ongoing. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you are able to do so, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Searches of this technology has led some agencies of staff to the small young company in California entitled True kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Originally, the company was not responsible for assisting in the taxation of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She sought to enter the growing market for the type of car insurance at which drivers pay on the basis of escape. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But devices it tests, involve designers of the road because they don&apos;t use GPS and provide limited amount of information, periodically loaded via a modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and do not track their location&quot; — Ryan Morrison, executive director of True miles of travel said. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programmes of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There are far less expensive and less intrusive way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon designers experiment providing various options to drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can select the device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they may refuse absolutely the device, having decided to pay rather than a fixed fee based on the average of miles, which is made by all residents of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places hope to sell an idea of a wary public, forcing devices to do more, and it is not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York transport officials seek to develop the taxing device, which will also accept payment on parking meters, to ensure &quot;pay as you go&quot; insurance and collect a pool of speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;Motorists will be recruited by benefit which to them will be offered&quot; — it is told in the document of town-planning design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers transportation systems, however, reflect on whether all the talk of mileage payment by simply enormous distraction is. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In the city transport commission in the area of the gulf San Francisco officials say the congress could overcome very simply bankruptcy of trust by the construction of roads, having raised taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> The additional single or annual tax could be raised from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, which they paid their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is — it to take aspirin&quot; — Randi Rentshler, the director of the commission on the legislation and the public relations told. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about her private life and a host of other things. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Pope Francis will embed the dignity of new cardinals of the Catholic church for the first time in his term of office on February 22 as said the Vatican on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Cardinals are senior clerics in the Catholic church after his father, and they elect fathers so Francis will appoint the first group of people who will participate ultimately to choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There are currently 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> However, after age of 80 by Cardinal he could not take part in his father&apos;s elections, any more — it is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;cardinals-electors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> In announcing this news, the spokesman for the Vatican father Federico Lombardi said that before the construction ceremony in a dignity the meeting of all current cardinals known as the conshistory will be held. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> &quot;Pope Francis decided to report in advance of his decision to call a conshistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from various corners of the world&quot; — Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization said that by February, the number of cardinals-electors will probably decline. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said that usually the father calls so many cardinals, how many it is necessary again to finish number of cardinals-electors to 120, and so many cardinals aged over 80 years, how many he would wish. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> The conshistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis&apos;s election in March this year, according to Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new father of cardinals from other parts of the world to restore the balance will appoint&quot; — he said. </seg>

<seg id="2641"> Now they don&apos;t do it and subsidies become direct account the responsibilities of the region. </seg>

<seg id="2644"> Many heads of enterprises expressed concern about the situation in a relationship with oil workers. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> The grant for equipment bought by them is competitive advantage of the industry in the South of the Tyumen region, and at its dissolution it would be difficult to compete on price with a central Russia, where cheaper labour. </seg>

<seg id="2692"> Message: the election headquarters of Obama considered Biden&apos;s exception in favour of Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Under The New York Times, the closest advisers to president Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> This discovery — the brightest sensation from all of the expected Mark Halperin and John Haylemann&apos;s book about campaign of 2012 &quot;the stakes are doubled: Game Change 2012 &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The The Times edition received a copy preparing for the book&apos;s release and reported on Thursday night that the closest aides to the President conducted &quot;extensive research in focus groups and surveys at the end of 2011&quot; to assess whether Biden&apos;s exclusion could help lift the dwindling hopes for Obama&apos;s re-election. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> According to a political analyst with The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by the senior officials of the campaign headquarters and the White house, namely, the former head of the administration of the White house Bill Daly, to assess what effect will have on vote appointment as Secretary of State Clinton vice-president. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Possible replacement was a secret, which is closely guarded in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval office. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Only six close advisers to the president - including Daly, a former head of the campaign headquarters of Obama Jim Messinu and former senior adviser to the White house David Axelrod; and David Pluff — knew that the replacement is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> The book &quot;The stakes Are Doubled&quot; claims that Daley was the initiator of trying to replace Biden, despite them &quot;a close personal relationship&quot; but eventually refused this step when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list not &quot;will improve significantly Obama&apos;s chances&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;I actively supported the multitude of things, and it was one of them&quot; — Daley told the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> You have to remember that at that point, the president was in a terrible form so we thought: &quot;Oh God, what to do to us? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> While Daley described research as &quot;necessary verification&quot;, Martin said the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the election headquarters attached to study of quite a lot whether will bring this step dividends on the vote. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> &quot;The election headquarters don&apos;t spend such sums of money to surveys and focus groups if they do not believe anything seriously&quot; — Martin in the programme of joint stock company 360 said. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> It is not clear, however, Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> Martin told CNN that he had asked Daly, if the boss of the time knew him about a possible reshuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> While Daley also said that he did not think the president &quot;was aware&quot; for a possible replacement, former head of the administration acknowledged that, &quot;probably&quot;, Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Martin added that &quot;the stakes are doubled&quot; does not provide a clear answer to question whether the outcome of the political sounding reached Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Cooper asked Martin whether seriously he believes that Obama did not know about research able to exclude Biden from the electoral roll. </seg>

<seg id="2716"> Legislative prohibition forced the Russians to drink less beer </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The Russian brewers have a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> On their estimations, consumption of beer in the country next year is stagnant, and it at best. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> While entrepreneurs had originally relied on growth. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> After all this year is developing for them failed: sales fell to 7 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> The head of one of the largest breweries of the country, the chairman of the board of the Union of Russian pivovarov Isaac Sheps at the third annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith said &quot;everyday necessities in Russia&quot; which just ended in Moscow of all this. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> On it discussed state regulation of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already been reduced by 18 per cent as in recent years in the country significant strengthening regulation of the brewing industry for the production and trafficking of beer - drink with a small alcohol content is respected, said to the audience of Sheps. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In one country in the world there is no such tight restrictions on the beer market, unpredictable introduction all the new and new illogical ban which settle allegedly combat alcohol abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The brewer, complained that many legislative ban designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse has no special effects, however constantly there are all new initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Most painfully on beer manufacturers struck the ban imposed from this year to sell alcohol in the stalls. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We lost immediately 35 thousand consumers&quot;, - Isaac Sheps said. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Next year at pivovarov two forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The optimistic - what said Sheps: sales of foam drink will remain intact. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The pessimistic - will fall to 2-3 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> To maintain their profits, entrepreneurs are forced to go from the classes calculated on the mass consumer to class &quot;premium&quot;: beer will become less, but it will be more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Meanwhile, radical effect by falling sales with a small quantity of alcohol, it is not visible. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;In my experience, the level of diseases of alcoholism is about the same - the narcologist Alexei Sotnikov reported. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> However, the proportion of patients using substitutes for strong drinks, as well as those who &quot;sat down&quot; on alcohol-based tonics like &quot;Jaguar&quot; while &quot;beer&quot; alcoholism prevailed about 10 years ago grew. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> To what will give the construction of TPU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Each year the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport and inter-station passage (ttco). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Until 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Than in practice, the project is wrapped, our correspondent understood. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago the Smolensk subways in the Arbat and pokrovsky line was the construction fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The caption read that there is the location of transport and transfer site. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> It was all very strange as near &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport stops and, therefore, you cannot change on it. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To reach the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome some 130 metres, including land transition through Karmanitsky Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now at &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost everything is over. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> The flower stall disappeared, stand for newspapers have been dismantled, and asphalt before entering was replaced by a stone blocks. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Here and all transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport and inter-station passage happen plane and capital - explain in the press-service of capital the department of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Capital TPU are not yet. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> And plane assume the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of the trade objects alarming to the movement of passengers, the establishment of small architectural forms and improvement. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> In fact, not even transport workers, and professional blagoustroitel from the department of major repairs of the city of Moscow are engaged in plane TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The transport hub it is not necessarily a complex design - is explained by the director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes the homeless and boards notifying on transport arrival time is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Here, for example, at the Yasenevo Metro opened quite full plane transfer site recently. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Let without lights, but with the captures car parks and boards indicating when the bus will come. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of number officials write to TPU everything that every possible thing. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> In 2011, the mayor planned to build for everything about all 151 nodes, of them 59 with capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now in plans until 2020 reappear 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> Of those, one hundred and fifty is promised to hand over this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although the city, there is a programme of development of TPU, is not identified any qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot; states. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report by the number of objects, but the quality of change on each of them often deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - speed of change, second, convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all able to replace a mode of transport, without leaving under the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow at location of TPU sometimes leaves rivno on the contrary. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Vivid example of the subway &quot;ENEA&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Earlier suburban buses from Yaroslavskoye Highway came to the square before the main entrance of the OCE. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now their stops moved to the opposite side of the Resident of Yaroslavl on Kosmonavtov Street. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Farther from the subway, much farther from the monorail, but is closer to homes. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Although residents did not want bus station under windows at all and complained to all possible instances. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital TPU in Moscow somehow immediately it was not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them began to be built at the Glider Metro about five years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project was intended to be exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And indeed the tale of how the transfer site assigned to investors turns into banal shopping centre happened. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, there are platforms for buses, the awning here not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> However, for the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU room was not made substantially. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> They as strangers were removed away from the Metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But places under trade remained more. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Only one clothing 32 stores, and in general are almost everything from zoogoods to a motor show. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well indeed, suddenly who from bus passengers want to buy on the way the new car? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> At us when build capital TPU, for some reason the shopping centre always is produced. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of parking was agreed to be given to the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Glider&quot; among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a lively trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The vegetables, spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-russian speech and security guards who are maliciously glancing at our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> The move site eventually turned into a market. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The fact is that earlier the Glider Metro had a market, but it was born. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> And in prefecture of dealers regretted and let on the captures parking of transfer site. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> All the same because of high prices it is always empty there. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The most ridiculous that demolished the market to build on its place... new plane TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Such here castling. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the Kaluga Metro the approach distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, Alexander Morozov said. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the construction of shopping centre, allegedly TPU, distance, increased to 170 metres. </seg>

<seg id="2802"> Let one or two floors will go to any platforms for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> There are at least 150,000 sq.m. commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> And it, for a minute, almost two ghuma. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> If capital TPU at stations and train stations are built by railway workers, other platforms will be spent by metropolitenovets. </seg>

<seg id="2810"> Ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or &quot;Spadayna&quot; in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> There trolleys and trams go down under the land on the level of the Metro and distance of approach from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Around any excess trade. </seg>

<seg id="2863"> The profit of Bombardier decreases with the fall of supply and number of orders for aircraft </seg>
<seg id="2864"> The Bombardier corporation, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday about reduced net profit for 15 per cent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> The Bombardier company located in Montreal also did not publish any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries plane and did not provide new information on, whether ambitious plans for introduction of the plane to commercial operation by next September will be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it took three more time that raises questions of whether the testing phase is progressing on schedule. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> The results did not justify forecasts and led to the fall of action for more than 8 per cent at Toronto Stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron Doyerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday, the assessment with &quot;above average market&quot; to &quot;average market&quot; because of the belief that growth for action is limited in the next quarter or two. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> &quot;Although weakening in the number of supply of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the returns of the transport department&quot; — Doyerksen in a review of the stock market said. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will generate more business for CSeries in the process of continuation of the programme of flight tests. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> However, if in the coming months, it is not announced new orders, we assume that the market will begin to be sceptical about the programme more. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will enable it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and for the first time circled in September after months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But so far there is little firm orders for CSeries — 177 as potential buyers await the outcome of flight tests to verify allegations of the company about fuel efficiency and earnings potential of the new aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In total there are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The chief executive officer Pierre Bodoin was confident that Bombardier will achieve the object of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane has been put into commercial operation. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> On Thursday heads also assured analysts and media that the programme is progressing according to plan. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> &quot;The test model of the plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected&quot; — Boduan during a conference call said, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled for downtime of the plane. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> All producers plan tests differently. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We decided to conduct the first flight and to make a break for updates, so we and came. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Will happen so throughout the programme of flight tests. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test samples must make flight in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow it as the company reported. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Yet analysts are sceptical that the first client will be able to start operation of the CSeries plane in 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bombardier said that it evaluates the vintage and will provide new information in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> &quot;This slow rate of flight tests - although is likely also in line with the domestic schedule of Bombardier - supports our view that commissioning would be postponed for the first quarter of 2015&quot; — Doyerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> In the third quarter ended September 30 net income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> The adjusted earnings per share remained the same — 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> The gross revenue declined slightly — from $4.2 to $4.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Analysts expected profit of 10 cents per share and the gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The fourth in the world in size the manufacturer of aircraft reported that he put 45 aircraft in the quarter which is less than the figure for previous the year - 57. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The portfolio of aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, without having changed since 31 December. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> &quot;In aerospace results area responded to our goal, but the small number of incoming orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor&quot; — Boduan said. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The gross income in the aerospace direction fell to 13 per cent — to $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest producer of trains, reported that the gross income in the sector grew by nearly 11 per cent — to $2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The portfolio in the transport division was $32.6 billion at September 30 that is slightly higher than the figure of 31 December. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Problems with the execution of several major contracts negatively affected the revenues of transport division. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> The office said that in the fourth quarter of a new development plan will be presented. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Shares of the company of Bombardier, which also said that the chief financial officer on Google Patrick Pichett will be on the board of directors, fell to 8.5 per cent — to С $4.83 traded in the middle of Thursday. </seg>

<seg id="2937"> Two members of YMCA are accused of sexual offences, even before the charges against Jonathan Lord as the Royal commission knew </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Two members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children before bringing charges in 2011 against employee of the facility on childcare in Karingbakh of Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal commission on child sexual abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> But in an opening statement of the commission stated that it &quot;never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse in the organization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> The chief executive officer Philippe Hare was asked about one case where an employee of YMCA was charged with offences relating to child pornography and the other case where the instructor at the gym in YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children who were under its supervision in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> Mr. Hare said Gale Ferness, to the counsel assisting the commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> He acknowledged that YMCA in opening remarks to the commission also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that &quot;there were external audits of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was on the safety of children in the forefront&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> The submitted commissions of the certificate say that YMCA was informed that he received a second since the end of the four possible rankings as a result of auditing quality performed by the Department of Education and communities in August this year. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Mr. Hare who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and a subordinate office provided a miss by hiring the Lord, and could not provide a clear understanding with the staff of the commitments to reporting breaches of security policy of children. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys within two years of his work in YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> He was imprisoned for at least six years. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics YMCA prevented staff to report violations of the Lord in the area of safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Staff testified that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, personally looked after them, put them herself on knees, said that he loves one of them and allow them to play a mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Daniel Okvell, which was under the direction of Lorda and asked to teach him in the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that found Jackie Barnat, the care manager over children of the office of YMCA in Karingbakh, which was the head Lorda, &quot;very frightening and often remote&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> The executive director said that he does not accept an explanation of staff that it was embarrassing for them to report on the situation to the supervisors. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the thought of the need to report him. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> Mr. Hare said that he submitted to the council of YMCA of New South Wales, the view that the lesson for the organization from &quot;incident with Jonathan Lord&quot; not &quot;concerns reporting&quot; from staff, and the council agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mr. Hare said the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the emergence of charges was made by the Director-General of the YMCA on child custody Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> He said it was designed to prevent damage to the evidence, but &quot;were overdo it&quot; and this decision poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> YMCA of New South Wales was not the organization, safe for children, in operating time of Jonathan Lord it between 2009 and 2011, an expert on issues of corruption of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith University reported the commissions. </seg>

<seg id="2979"> It is safe to say that the New York — the birthplace of the stendap-comedy in America: Almost 100 years ago, the variety actor Frank ippe working as entertainer at Palace Theatre Theatre at the Broadway began to tell jokes directly to public in a conversational way. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Ippe&apos;s innovation was picked up over time by others, most recently, the New York comedy festival. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Created and supervised by Carolyn Hyorsh, the founder of Carolines stendap-club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and great theatres. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;Most of these headliners began in Carolines, and then were more successful reached the point where they are already too famous to speak at the club&quot; — said Hyorsh. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> We created this festival as a way to continue with them work. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> This year the event &quot;Stendap for heroes&quot; an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square, Garden where there will be among other Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosbey includes Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mar&apos;s speeches, as well. </seg>

<seg id="2988"> Jenny Slate was a cast as in &quot;Saturday evening on the air&quot; and, in &quot;Parks and recreation areas&quot; while most of all it is known on a series of viral clips &quot;Marseille - a mussel in boots&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Both Croll, and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, the liar, focused on racial topic by Kamau Bell) — is the result of decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> David Steinberg&apos;s interview with Larry David will be one of the high points of the festival. </seg>
