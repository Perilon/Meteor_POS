<seg id="1"> A republican strategy of the resistance to the repeated election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republicans&apos; leaders justified their policy with the necessity of struggle with falsifications in an election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However at the Center Brennana believes the last the myth asserting that the cases of falsifications in an election in the United States are rarer than the cases of death from lightning stroke. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The republicans&apos; lawyers have besides counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> To one say with certainty: is possible these new tendencies will have negative influence on the electors&apos; attendance. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada the American states bear responsibility for an organization of the federal election in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Just therefore the majority of the governments of the states since 2009 adopt laws, complicating a process of the registration or a voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new scope after the election in November 2010 which has brought the republicans 675 new places in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills, restricting right of the voice in 41 states, were mistaken only for the alone year 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New laws of an election require an elector to show the identity card with photography and a proof of the presence of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Besides that these laws reduce a period of a voting ahead of schedule, abolish right of a registration of an elector in a day of will and take away right of the voice from the citizens having conviction. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before an election of 2006 not a single American state obliged the electors to show the identity card with photography. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana has become the first state which has introduced a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The supreme court of the USA confirmed constitutionality of law, adopted in Indiana, in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities have hurried to spread this practice also other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During the two last years they initiated bills, obliging the electors to show the identity cards with photography, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike Quebec the American citizens haven&apos;t such a universal identity card as a card of medical insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, 11 % of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people that have been at age, necessary for a voting, haven&apos;t the identity card with a photograph of their staff, yielded by the governmental organ. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides that, five million new electors in 2012 haven&apos;t a similar document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this case the cost of reception of the necessary identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect the youth, minorities and the people with the low level of the incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25 % of Afro-Americans, 15 % of people, earning 000 dollars less than 35, 18 % of citizens are older than 65 years and 20 % of electors haven&apos;t from 18 to 29 years the necessary identity card with photography. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But all of it yet not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students - the electors who as reckons, vote for the candidates the democrats, for several states it isn&apos;t permitted to use the identity card with photography, yielded by their training institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But the same states permit the members of the fishing and hunting clubs which vote in the main thing for the republicans to use the certificates, yielded by these clubs, for a voting. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Not a single state required before 2004 a proof of the presence of American citizenship for a voting. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time the similar requirement was brought in in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Beginning with 2011 more than ten states have adopted laws, requiring the electors to prove that they are the citizens of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures obviously are aimed at the fact to restrict a voting of the descendants of the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two thirds of the Latin-American electors vote in favour to the Democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Besides that the republican lawmakers initiated laws, abolishing a registration of the electors in a day of voting in eight states, in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They have also restricted right of the individuals or the groups to give help to ones who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction hasn&apos;t taken place without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, 2004 years, for example are during an election the campaign of a registration of the electors has helped to introduce about 10 million citizens from the lists. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the same time measures taken beginning with 2009, have brought to fall on 17 % of level of the registration of the new electors in the year 2010 in comparison with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition republican lawmakers have adopted laws, aimed at reduction of a period of a voting ahead of schedule, in five other states. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So during the general election of the year 2008 in Florida 33 % of electors that were voting were the Afro-Americans, although the last were only 13 % of the common number of electors of the state ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same happened also to the descendants of the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Presenting only 11 % of electors they were 24 % of the citizens who voted ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Which unlike white forming 76 % of electors among being voting were only 46 % ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The, of course, lawmakers-democrats and their partisans actively oppose acceptance of laws, restricting a registration of the electors. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several projects of laws were the vetirovano governors-democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended in intervention by the General Prosecutor of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It has allowed partially restricting of negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Laws, requiring producing of the identity card with photography, have accepted so, for example only 16 of the 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless the new rules that have entered action certainly will complicate exercise of selective right in an election of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The critics from the democrats condemn a prejudice of the laws which were adopted seeing obvious orientation to the fact to influence results of the election of the year 2012 in the key states in them. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report of the center of Brennana from 2011 demonstrates that the states that have adopted these laws present 171 of the 270 voices, necessary in the electors&apos; board to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> To assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have essential influence on results of the presidential election of 2012 is else too early. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one is doubtless: these new theses will have negative influence on the electors&apos; attendance. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening of cancer of the prostate gland: study a test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact the test for a dog gives the occasionally erroneous results false negative, and occasionally also false positive which result in useless medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The men, also so reluctantly passing medical monitoring, have something to doubt from even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To study a test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked two specialists&apos; opinion. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In investigations, carried out in the United States, the numerous cases of infection among the investigated groups were observed, it is difficult to interpret therefore obtained data and it is difficult to produce any distinct recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The other European investigation on this time has detected the different level of mortality at those patients who have passed screening, and ones who didn&apos;t pass him. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This investigation has also shown after 12 year-old observation that it is the probability of appearance, the metastasis is on higher for 30-40 % up with ones who haven&apos;t passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore I would recommend to study a test beginning approximately 50 years, or since 40 if one of the direct kinsmen had cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of Afro-American origin are also subject to heightened risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Acceptance of a correct solution is once the crayfish is detected the key moment. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The crayfish can be both aggressive, and slow. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is for a patient necessary to explain the degree of risk of his cancerous disease, proposing the possible versions to it, without obligatory treatment of the cancer of the prostate which doesn&apos;t constitute danger for life in long-term prospect, and making a choice in these cases in favour to active observation of a disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> For today many the men at which the cancer, course for treatment is revealed, won&apos;t elapse for their cancer is not aggressive and doesn&apos;t represent threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We shall propose active observation to them, and if the disease begins to progress, we shall begin treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> All we with precision define as more frequent criteria for making of a decision on one who is have to or hasn&apos;t to study course for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus I would recommend nevertheless to study a test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to also consult about the doctor to define if it is necessary or not to study this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> There are urologies in the cooperation with the International association, Movember has created an instrument, allowing estimating of everything behind and against a pass of a test for a dog. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It is possible to download this document (as long as in the English language the translation is accessible in the near future) to the address: http:// ca.movember com/ fr/ mens-health/ prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent a disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Regretfully miracle recipe doesn&apos;t exist to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Notwithstanding progress of scientific researches observance of the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to decrease risk of a disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that, if all people superbly fed, and sufficiently moved, to prevent would be is for 30 % of cases rako possible. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody more smoked this figure would grow at least to 50 %&quot; - the, Andre Bol&apos;e underlines, press secretary of the Canadian association of the crayfish. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However by estimations, 10 % of the crayfish&apos;s cases are caused by the heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of the crayfish remain perfectly inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian association of the crayfish struggle with smoking remains priority notwithstanding decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is connected with 85 % of cases of cancer of the lungs. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is the factor of risk for many other. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It causes severe harm to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today 1,5 million smokers - in Quebec exist&quot;, press secretary Andre Bol&apos;e speaks. </seg>
<seg id="85"> A fact: in 10 years after a refusal of smoking risk to die from cancer diminishes half giving hope. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to data of punishments the redundant weight and the obesity also contribute to appearance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase risk of appearance of cancer of the mammary gland, the large and direct intestine, the gullet, the pancreas gland and the womb. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Investigations show that the regular physical activity during the whole life protects against cancer of the large intestine&quot; -, is added to the Associations. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Supply </seg>
<seg id="91"> Also the association recommends to restrict consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities it increases risks of appearance of cancer of the thick bowels. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It is necessary to avoid also the sausage articles. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Temporarily closing of meat by smoke-drying, drying or salting can result in formation of the carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The last can cause harm to the cages of the body and result in the development of a crayfish&quot; -, is explained in an Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In the last years many scientists dealt with investigation into influence of vitaminic additions on the development of a crayfish. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But for a given moment it is impossible to name the results of these investigations unambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="99"> In opinion SCC investigations into vitamin E give contradictory results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them has shown decrease in risk of the development of cancer of the prostate then other has given opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> There also is no full clarity in estimation of influence on the development of a crayfish of vitamin D. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However Mr Bol&apos;yo emphasizes that it is important to discuss its worries and family anamnesis with a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The surrender of analysis doesn&apos;t result in cancer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Boson Khiggsa is in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> In past summer the message of the fact that the scientists perhaps have succeeded in detecting boson Khiggsa caused real flurry - also not without cause. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It isn&apos;t believed little that explain this boson the mass of all particles in the universe, nor much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Besides that it was the last particle existence of which was is predicted in the frames to Standard the models -, it the best, or, in any case the &quot;the least imperfect&quot; description of nature and behaviour of matter, - but which earlier didn&apos;t prove possible to detect us in an experimental way. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But the physicists as far back as not before the end are sure that the matter concerns just about boson Khiggsa. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without shadow of doubt that we have an affair with an indeed new particle and that she strongly resembles boson Khiggsa, predicted by the Standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Besides that new presented data are in this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for full certainty of some data don&apos;t obtain yet. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We shall imagine nevertheless that the matter concerns about boson Khiggsa, for we also shall see the chances to be mistaken seem the minimum that mean it *really*/*the_same*. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Is, in this world one law is perfectly unavoidable, saying that two things cannot turn out in the same place in the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No possibility, to bypass this rule is even not try too diligently, otherwise you will harm to itself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although physics of the elementary particles is, it turns out that there in it too is one law of the similar character: the principle of exception Pauls which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space in the same moment of the time if they stay in the same &quot;quantal state&quot; enough strange peace this &quot;state&quot; is concluded, in the common lines, in their some descriptions -. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Proceeding from it the physicists divide the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> We find the respectable citizens named fermionami who are judiciously subordinated to a principle Pauls in an alone corner. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In different fuss the bosons, the infamous gang of the anarchists who haven&apos;t respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can imperturbably turn out in the same place in the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> As a site, (by the way perfectly unusual), imparts Particle Adventure of Berkeley&apos;s Laboratory these bosons, the groups: the X-particles, to which boson Khiggsa relates divide in its turn into two about which we here shan&apos;t speak, and &quot;the particles of force&quot;, by which and in some kind the basic forces of nature spread. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It is necessary to emphasize these most bosons, such exotic creatures as it was possible to think are not everything. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact if you succeed in reading this chronicle then which due to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or &quot;a particle of light&quot; is it is &quot;a courier&quot; of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when one particle, having an electric charge, accelerates or changes a direction it &quot;violates&quot; the electromagnetic field in this particular place about as a stone, thrown to a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violation&quot; the electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), is born, and not what other as a photon - and, subsequently, one of the bosons &quot;of the carriers of force&quot; this wave is. </seg>
<seg id="123"> A more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same happens also to boson Khiggsa, only that difference that, so that this boson appears the other field, Khiggsa field must be &quot;violated&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="125"> An only very large stone, to reach very and very high energies, as if the matter concerned about the pond the surface of which was able that has frozen to shake Khiggsa field is to excite him necessary is however much much more stable than the electromagnetic field;. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Here why is the huge accelerator of the particles as one who is exploited in Tarna - the Large Hadron Collider, being a ring with the diameter of 27 kilometres! - for achievement of so huge energies, necessary.! </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with an electromagnetic field is useful also also to the explanation of correlation between boson Khiggsa and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some as, for example the magnets one interacts, different - there is: the sheet no paper, for example never won&apos;t *HOLD$ON* oneself on a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Particles as though as not all interact with a field of Khiggsa: ones who interact, have mass, whereas other (as a photon by the way) haven&apos;t her. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Thus what &quot;can all these investigations bring&quot;, does Mrs. Plamondon ask? </seg>
<seg id="132"> They are used for science for a checkup of correctness of the Standard Model (centimetre), and it also allows the physicists to fumble with disagreement between results of observations and the forecasts of centimetre. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Besides some of them passionately are willing that such a disagreement will transpire, by the volume to the smallest mismatch can open a door for &quot;new physics&quot; and stop up some holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The last, it is necessary to say everything, else has the essential shortcomings not proposing any explanation for the which for gravitation (ouch) or dark matter forms about 80 % of the universe (ouch *THE*th)!. </seg>
<seg id="135"> But as long as such disagreements haven&apos;t been found in Tarna. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequence </seg>
<seg id="137"> To predict benefit of these investigations to everyday life of the average person is more difficult, but it would be a mistake to suppose that there is no her. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Look: at the very beginning of the 60th years the pioneers of investigations into a laser of Bell&apos;s laboratories wouldn&apos;t be able even also to suppose what revolution their works will cause. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their applications in science, but that is not more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Even the indeed deceased physicist Uillard Bojl who worked in the Laboratories of Bell where in 1960 the laser, was invented and which oneself has developed, the first continuous laser (previous were the impulse) in 1962 yrs, said that the laser had been initially considered rather as &quot;laboratory gadget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Present </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides that, the application can be found for the tooling accompanying investigation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> The, for example one of most Uilliard Bojl during its optical investigations in 1969 has developed a small sensor of light. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it quite wasn&apos;t its initial predestination now serves as &quot;the eye&quot; for all the digital cameras of the world and has deserved the Nobel prize in physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> It, of course, doesn&apos;t mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider necessarily will change our life, but it only shows in fact that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative help is the best way to die| &quot;Debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> In a Commission behind worthy death the delicate question of the end of life in Quebec has been recently discussed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate shortly must be resumed, and in this time the bill is prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> One nevertheless in this most important region much else is in for making. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; have tried to glance closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> In all several weeks ago the gentleman L.. Else lived alone in his apartment into Monterezhi. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The cancer of the prostate that was destroying it from within has given adjournment for two years to him. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;To me gave five years, I have lived in seven&quot; -, he says between life and death lying in a shelter from palliative departure Victor-Gadbua in Belyoj in a bed, where have come the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always the shock, to for it prepare, - oneself is impossible&quot;, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its work: the incredible weakness which doesn&apos;t allow independently going to a toilet and even independently to feed. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting behind the table on which appetizing lunch stands he gives in and agrees that will help him to receive food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He braces up, even contrives to smile, speak with the unfamiliar people who work around him, the medications, bring for him, lead him to a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage is before common death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My strongest wish that I have been cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating&quot; -, he confesses. </seg>
<seg id="160"> After several hours the personnel has found a medication for this ailment. </seg>
<seg id="161"> That &quot;during life it is taught that the man must urinate standing - tells Pierre Broder, the psychologist in a shelter from Victor-Gadbua to us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress before the state of the child - for some is unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on the person&apos;s ability&quot; to reconcile oneself with degeneration -, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="164"> The for in opinion of many people, dealing with palliative departure important events sluchayayutsya and in the very height of this degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients which enter palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua are still sick of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> The forecasts allocate them the maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this phase the command of the doctors and the nurses doesn&apos;t grant more help named &quot;curative&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Madam A., 89 years most of all fears die &quot;in consciousness from suffocation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But on the other hand the disease has allowed me to recognize its children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have the good children&quot; -, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I don&apos;t want more anything in life&quot; - she speaks before permit to place a mask facilitating breath in her. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She, as before, expects in coming days of the last visit of her son that has come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In shelter Victor-Gadbua maintenance of the body and help in supply with the help of a group of the volunteers are granted. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It also is palliative departure which remains, when to make more nothing is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In 700 inhabitants&apos; Quebec on each 11 one place in the institutions of palliative help falls. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very few taking into account that early or late we all shall die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here the life continues in the best conditions, which is possible, doctor Christian Martel&apos; - alone from the doctors of the shelter explains. </seg>
<seg id="179"> That be comfort, physical, emotional or sincere. </seg>
<seg id="180"> To dying we shall agree to grant oral of rinsing from a brandy or Pepsi, seeing what it will ask. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We more don&apos;t make the diabetics monitor the level of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is the part of the everydayness. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday in the evening we brought beer for the gentleman Kh.. which died today in the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> In the morning his son finished drinking this beer in the legs with the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help the relatives as also the patients&quot; - the, Natalia Savar tells, director from maintenance of the patients. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Not one day is in shelter Victor-Gadbua not similar to previous. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to the 93 year-old old man which enjoys its last meeting with a family in a yard settling on its pillows during a toast in its honour the young man of 36 years, surrounded with the parents, the wife and two small children and pereprobovashij, everything tragically die to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Up to 45 years - worriedly doctor Christian Martel&apos; speaks are always occupied with the the lastly half a year from three to five beds cancerous patients at the age&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53 % of patients, received the shelter, are Victor-Gadbua, comes from a house, and *BE* 47 % from a hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative departure </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77 % of Canadians just haven&apos;t the access to palliative departure i.e. to departure which is given to have facilitated sufferings of the patients that have entered into the final stage of their life if that had been on a house, in a hospital or in a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Also some institutions, such an as a shelter Victor-Gadbua and a Society of palliative maintenance on a house of the Large Montreal specialize more or less exceptionally in departure of the cancerous patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Just this large blank of a system of health protection of Quebec makes many doctors - of the specialists in palliative departure fear acceptance of a law, legalizing euthanasia and help in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Beginning with October circulates the manifest, signed by leading lights of the domain of palliative departure, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and doctor Bernard Lyapuantom, also testifying to their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the words of doctor Christian Martel&apos; the system of health protection of Quebec is insufficiently effective to insure right of palliative departure of high quality before a transition to euthanasia will be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="196"> She - speaks I saw the patient who has spent 14 days in the section on emergency aid, in fearful pains, and nobody, haven&apos;t recently - taken necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that the patients wish to die only because they don&apos;t receive adequate departure. </seg>
<seg id="198"> In the same time many oncologists try before the last day to salvage the patients notwithstanding the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for Ellen&apos;s survival Richard have already been the minimum, when it stopped tiring out chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I reported to my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she has answered to me, that regret that I stop struggle -, she tells. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In this case she herself told me that my days were believed! </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no omnipotent departure </seg>
<seg id="203"> Doctor Martel&apos; believes that which ask 90 % of patients about death, thank the medical staff for the fact that they haven&apos;t granted their request, after the command over palliative departure relieves their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> It is however necessary to note that palliative departure isn&apos;t absolutely omnipotent in struggle with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to the words of *Elsie* Monroe, the director from palliative departure in a Society of palliative departure on a house of the Large Montreal the patients are not receptive to anaesthetization in 8 % of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life the doctors often resort to palliative sedatsii, at which the patient sleeps before a moment of its death, either from time to time, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> One may not more pretend that we don&apos;t know of these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> All more often and more often the patients who don&apos;t succeed in relieving pain will be able to have access to palliative sedatsii. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The patients, suffering from pain, always say the same sentence: &quot;YA want to die&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But not necessarily it means that &quot;I want that for me euthanasia will be conducted&quot;, it means that &quot;I want that I shall feel more at ease&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Creation of this reportage has become possible due to the journalistic grant from the Institute of investigations into the health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The large-scale scandals of a real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> An official the persons, responsible for the construction contractors a construction of the roads, the collectors of means for the political parties and the specialists in an Italian mafia behind a day tell the fact that they know &quot;of a colossal system&quot;, enmeshing construction industry, the state employees, the politicians, the trade-union workers and a mafioso, day. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;The industry&quot; which has very dearly cost the taxpayers of Quebec especially in the 1990 and 2000 years. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;I wonder how this system after all means were let into an affair, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and the former chief of the police of Montreal jokes, spills&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Just due to him the scandal as collateral in 2011 broke out, the result of investigation into official crimes, connected with the road construction contracts in Quebec, on which is prime minister of that time from the liberals Jean Share, have agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Dyusheno report&quot; has established a direct connection between an industry, secret financing of the political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;From the beginning of investigation in 2010, he, only the one Ministry of the transport underline, would keep a billion dollars on the contracts&quot; if some restrained their instincts to take a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Sharbonno commission &quot;has already displaced two mayors&quot;, he adds hoping that she will succeed &quot;in opening the schemes, standing behind the individual personalities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> The permanent subdivision in struggle with corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The created in 2011 Permanent subdivision in struggle with corruption the vast staff of the governmental auditors, the investigators and the analysts has been included into composition of which has switched to an affair. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, besides that, the employees of the special subdivision &quot;Hammer&quot;, who after 2009 have made &quot;the drain cartel&quot; of Montreal, stop overstatement are the costs of the contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Over a distance of the last weeks the series of searches was carried out, and accusations of fraud and corruption some municipal officials, in particular the Franc Zampino and Richard Markottu - the mayor of the small small town, were made. </seg>
<seg id="224"> There is Gilles Vajyankur, having recently resigned from an office of mayor Lavalya, third in the value of the city of province Quebec, the office, on the queue. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of multiple reception of the bribes in locating of the state orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Besides that official accusation was made several engineers of the service of the ways of the message of Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin of including Tony Akkurso and Lino with a Deputy beaten. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last has exploded a real bomb reporting to investigation &quot;about a system&quot; of reception of the state contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> During several years of Deputy beaten gave back to of the 3 % cost of the contracts, made in Montreal, for a certain intermediary tied together with a mafia who in one&apos;s turn transfered money of the party of mayor Zheral&apos;da Tramble &quot;the Combined Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000th years of Deputy beaten littered money to the right and to the left It has listed more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (there are 000 euros near 68) different the parties of the province, in the main thing the liberals that were having the power then. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Besides that he has confessed that he illegitimately raised funds of the former deputy of the prime minister from the Liberal party of Natalia Normando. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The sewerage contracts in which cost was overstated </seg>
<seg id="232"> &quot;The system&quot; of corruption worked in Montreal faultlessly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Syurprenan, the engineer that was being over a civil construction in detail has described her in front of a commission: behind he has received ten years from the construction companies of gifts, invitations into the journeys, on the tournaments in golf, to the restaurants, on the matches in hockey also of the bribes there are 000 dollars altogether on 736 of which in exchange for the sewerage contracts the cost he overstated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other official persons, responsible for a construction of the roads, have confessed that they received on the paw overstating the accounts 30-40 % with the help of the false complements. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer from the party of mayor Martan Dyumon accused Mr Tramble of the fact that it deliberately closed the eyes with existence of the parallel budget that was filling the party cash desks with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations Mr Tramble has resigned at the beginning of November immersing Montreal in a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Shantal&apos; *RULO* was alone from the first deputies in Montreal that have set up alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor is Riv&apos;er-environment de-Preri in the east of an island her, oppose since 2010 to a sale of the municipal bought area, 5 million are for the dollars and construction boom, resold for 1,6 million to the developers in height. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70 % of dirty money are in the election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She says that in the investigation which in the final analysis will be begun, she &quot;will pull the thread, allowing understanding of functioning of the system, swarming with the ants to stop gangrene and define culpable&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process she kharakterezuet as &quot;is sickly, but is positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in a process of cleaning of a wound, but the own investigation group and an observer, for Montreal will be necessary to avoid return of doubtful practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we tidy up at home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Dyusheno notices from his side that &quot;the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but a role &quot;of the elective official officials, that knew of this scheme&quot;, but being not participating in machinations worries especially him. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Taking into account that the share of dirty money of financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70 % he jokes: &quot;I have been said that it was only pale reflection of reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes to restrict up to 100 dollars of donation to the parties, but, according to its words, it won&apos;t change a situation: &quot;As long as we shan&apos;t restrict elective expenses strictly there will be dirty money in a politician&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> He requires full rearrangement of a system of allocation of the state contracts and financing of the parties: &quot;We cannot lower lower; boldly bottoming the essence of the things, we shall be able to build a house on the more solid foundation, with the best control and legality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history also throws shadow on an international image of Quebec and Montreal Mr Dyusheno calls on ones who laugh to peep to an own yard </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSZH - not the Soccer Club Barcelona&quot;! </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season you into PSZH attained an unusual scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How will you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It can be explained with individual consciousness, but can - also by new measurement PSZH. </seg>
<seg id="254"> The great players have come. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I grow each day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Also the technical personnel has introduced much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me daily raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during a match, it is simpler. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything happens in football very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t incense. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the very beginning at the center of preliminary preparation into NIF into Klerfontene and before my coming in Sep-Et&apos;en I always marched ahead. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus you benefit a competition, set by Carlo Anchelotti </seg>
<seg id="263"> The replenishment of this summer must hold not the novelty the matches of the very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know also that each training is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> It results in the fact that such a player as me is willing to be at the level and bear down in the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Besides that Carlo Anchelotti shows a support in my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Such deputies as Claude Makelele who played at the same position that me help him. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Anchelotti - the master of a position? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Anchelotti enjoys respect the whole technical personnel. </seg>
<seg id="271"> There today to him are no equal in the First League, and he is included into the number of the best trainers of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has vast experiment, and it has won many titles with the high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with the great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring the new titles for Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> With me with him there was the talk giving hope in the January. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I drew back from the entire series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence which he has me also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of season PSZH? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the First League Lyon has taken away the leader&apos;s place from us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we, as before, are ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our basic aims is the Champion&apos;s: League we were exquisitely qualified into one the eighth the final. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We shall try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Henceforth everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We shall be able to say our word by the face to the face with the very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We at first want to finish in the first in our group, in front of *PORTO* to have a possibility to receive an answering match for one of the eighth of the final. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Will PSZH be able to become the first-class European club in short-term prospect? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He for it has a budget already </seg>
<seg id="289"> It is for that to become the large European club for Paris necessary to win the titles and fasten the positions on long-term perspective. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially PSZH have means to make this project real. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take a title in the First League as in past season, will be a large failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be large disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In this year we strongly wish actual to hook in this champion title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In past season we were to it near. </seg>
<seg id="296"> The disappointment in May was because we had everything to come to finish the first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished him with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The champion&apos;s title supposes, as a rule, 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other command, has played more more fantastic season with Montpellier. </seg>
<seg id="301"> In this year, I think, everything will be in an order. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Notwithstanding the fact that struggle for a title have started such strong commands as Marseilles, Lyon and Bordeaux I think that we have forces to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Don&apos;t you think that the mass media expect too much from PSZH? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that from us is expected much how much taking into account was inserted, and which the players with us are. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are completely ready for it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we win the houses 4-0 against Trua and we are nevertheless found for what criticize, of course, a little it upsets. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We have a question what primarily the people expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win each weekend with score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the Soccer Club Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to introduce the project of a game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed with the time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proved in the Champion&apos;s League that we can accept the modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look, on Manchester, united which doesn&apos;t succeed already two seasons in going into the one eighth the final, although they have too spent huge money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Taking embedded sums into account we presented you on 15 points ahead already to the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be neglect of our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseilles which weren&apos;t at the height in past season, was &quot;awakened&quot; by it new PSZH. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows that the First League is to what extent fascinating. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we shall be able to smile and tell myself that notwithstanding all difficulties we have won at result. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSZH, it seems, completely depends on the feats of Zlatana Ibragimovicha. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Well, and that, if it is told that some &quot;Zlatanozavisimost&apos;&quot; exists. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibragimovich is very successful, and that he scores many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has come for it, and he proves that he is a star of the First League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere where he played, he has shown that he is the great player and is a star of the world scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In a group we esteem as a person and as a player him. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He too esteems the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The fact that it has made, it is indeed exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates also different to improve its game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> T&apos;yago Silva which is one of the best defenders in the world, also justify everybody move ahead. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you outlived by Euro-2012 from the national team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I strongly wished to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Regretfully my injury has hampered me in snatching a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw many things there, and I have gone out from there more strongly. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I succeed in holding the good qualifying matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is one, for which I hoped from a moment of my baptism at Blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have extracted the lessons from the fact that have happened in the Ukraine, and now have to behave exemplarily. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshama at the head Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They for him are effective. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has the good positions in a qualifying group to world championship. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He is a strict trainer, he is close to the players and inspires on a victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Which Loran Blan was. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I wouldn&apos;t want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blan has achieved the aim, he qualified us into a Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good deserved draw (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is the basic match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given belief in itself to us. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each combated for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, in my career the similar matches weren&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="349"> To pay and sell without help of the banks - from Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> Sharp contrast with the current money exchange, based on the Central Banks, numbered transactions, between the receiving sides c of commissional collections on their treatment. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Political vision: conviction that the present currency system, consisting of the bank monopolies, results in the financial crises besides that, as often happens to these technologies, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact Bitcoin invented, Satoshi Nakamoto (the alias), simultaneously is virtual currency (but converted into the dollars a euro) and a protected protocol of exchange over the type BitTorrent which allows realizing of exchange of the files between the participants of one level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> 000 operations have already been registered near 200 from 15 000 computers on network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites receive bitkojny for a realization of donations or as payoff means. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course bitkojna reaching the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011 after five months has decreased to 2 dollars, before return today approximately to ten dollars (courses are specified on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with world exchange of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless the European central bank (ETSB) in its report of virtual currency, published in October, has got interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes bitkojn as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with a dollar or a euro&quot;, also &quot;similar to common currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as &quot;the credits&quot;, used for advancement in the video game, which work too much in a process of the game, or to which buy (and occasionally also exchange) is possible. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network of Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But always monitor the operations of exchange and process any central organ. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In Bitkojn all nodes of network are the holders of the account book, the auditors, the issuers of currency, pokupatelymi and the sellers simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network function? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users happens in fact between two electronic addresses, like an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> The user can choose the other address only for each new payment providing anonymity with such an image. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The set of information, relating to this transaction, signs electronically, with use of a system of encryption with a double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network also can check authenticity of transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> What bitkojny due to content of the file perhaps check used for transaction indeed one exists in a public countable book, sent to the whole network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A registration of new transaction in this book is key phase. </seg>
<seg id="370"> She passes through a solution of a mathematical task, sent to the computers, the having solved which as temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The matter concerns about the phase of hashing of a file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; new transaction and add her number, everybody together is in front of that as &quot;hash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim consists in the fact to find the number which will give unique digital signature (many zeroes at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found other nodes easily check that it is correct. </seg>
<seg id="375"> nerarzryvno the transaction in such a way turns out connected with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If with a view on deception the user very quickly (less than in ten minutes) would wish to pay two times with alone also to a theme, only one of these two transactions was confirmed network - and other would remain unconfirmed, for they have different electronic signatures money. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that has solved a task receives 50 bitkojnov. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation the award regularly shares by half probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number bitkojnov in appeal therefore is restricted to 21 million, but they are divisible before one, for one hundred-a million which leaves some more reserve </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task also grows with an increase of computational power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of network has already experienced the take-offs and falls. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The sites, rendering Bitcoin services, were subject to an attack, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used defect doesn&apos;t concern the protocol - Pierre Nuaza who has recently launched a company assures Paymium - itself&quot; realizing payments by real money of using network of Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> This has reported also about a possibility of laundering of money through this anonymous service ETSB. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash money also possesses this shortcoming. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Large players, such, how Wikipedia, refuses to receive donations of such a kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Different, such as a blog-platform WordPress resolve them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute of Weizmann in Israel has recently analyzed a countable book and has detected that almost 80 % bitkojnov aren&apos;t in a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;The gigantic sales&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were swapped&quot;, Jon working Kholmkvist, is glad, which there is in Coinabul, deals with conversion bitkojnov into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Nuaza, the other author of a manual of this currency strongly believes in the potential of this technology as operational network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> She, his system Paytunia is equivalent of the credit card (in real money) or non-contacting payment across a mobile phone, but, Bitcoin for a checkup of transactions, uses, which in such a way goes out, is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner better monitors his personal data and can in such a way be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is simple in a realization for the businessmen for whom it is not necessary to set the new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is sufficient to only report the address is &quot;to which possible photograph and recognize&quot; by telephone, Pierre Nuaza precises assuring that he has already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> A common tendency to revision of the hierarchical systems in favour more to horizontal exists. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before Bitcoin will be established some time will pass, but 2013 can become a turning point&quot; -, he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> ETSB in its report intends by the way to revise versatile risks, believed today increased, in a case of success in this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have gone away from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What is further? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops have abandoned their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army the time to return the control of its territory to oneself and for the Afghans choose its future not hoping only for us has come. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The Afghan peasants whom we considered as the terrorists have suffered in the main thing from us. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consists of the foreign extremists, the former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but it is also frequent from the peasants who decline the presence of the foreign army as it was at the USSR. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tadjiks and are archaic, although even them join dzhikhadisty, are old. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They are tolerated, them occasionally help the local insurgents, but they more won&apos;t be, once the West will begin to behave more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Passed the departure of the French troops from Nidzhrab base which I observed from the height of the planted hills with the almond trees due to French credits in an order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The escorts of the lorries and the armoured vehicles in the accompaniment of the helicopters have reached Kabul not being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of the year 2014 of invasion the Talibs won&apos;t be on Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have varied since times of their insurmountable advancement from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> In that time Kabul was empty, the country was on a fire and the blood because of struggle between the different groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking by them under the control of a country then was perceived as a the kind release, return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan women have paid behind the these peasants&apos; obscurantism in which al-Qaeda has surpassed them, but their position hasn&apos;t improved and in our days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The former Mojaheds, the Afghan government and the present Talibs are integral in their wish to retain the women the subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The basic characters of anti-Soviet war have returned to the power in 2001 yrs. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have converted into the hustlers, capturing the state lands to resell them under building to the repatriates that have returned from Iran and Pakistan using the huge American contracts of the subcontract. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; their, majority, by the way, even oneself didn&apos;t fight. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I heard in the rural area, want the government which would consist not of the thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave as ones who have managed will leave by American generosity: the outflow of the capitals is significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people got tired with a war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world during banishment in Iran or Pakistan, they have estimated his advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65 % of the population are at the age up to 25 years; in Kabul 5 million inhabitants, now exist, the fifth is one of the common population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The state schools in the cities are filled in with both the boys, and the girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide with the work places of these young people who won&apos;t want to return either to obscurantism of the old batches or to corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everybody of including the armed militants likes the mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas which present the modern world, and which see everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the present moment the army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will the authorities which will command her be believed legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The old commanders that were waging anti-Soviet struggle take measures of restoration of the provincial groups which wouldn&apos;t be subordinated to the central power already. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the mountain country with strong local differences, must be before the definite degree decentralized over a sample of the western countries, but the United States wanted to convert him to the centralized state with the strong presidential power eliminating an office of the prime minister which existed since times of the Constitution 1964 years. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai doesn&apos;t want the foreign control especially before the election, planned for April 2014. </seg>

<seg id="601"> The deputies of both the State Duma and the federal migration service have supported the initiative in introduction of testing. </seg>
<seg id="602"> And before the law has entered into force, many times have here the human rights activists had time to ask a question: and that, properly speaking, it will give in a press? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What will change obligatoriness of knowledge of a language for both the Russians and the newcomers themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Primarily - the representatives of a migratory service - answer that it will allow decreasing of the number of people, suffering &quot;from labour slavery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Very many speak the protection of the labour migrants&apos; rights, the head of the representation of the federal migration service of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev explains, now. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of their rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only the system of an organized set will allow on 90 % solving of the foreign workers&apos; problems. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems appear at the migrants without a profession, education, not knowing a language, not having medical examination. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding of a language -, Sebelev - is sure, the future migrant is doomed to collide with the unconscientious people who under the kind of help will stick in him &quot;to a voucher&quot; to an eery tight hut where it and tens of similar to it will languish the months without food and the documents sticking 12-14 hours per twenty four hours each. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive a set of the complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home him one, is promised and over arrival deceives them, selects the passports, doesn&apos;t pay salary - to promised&quot;, the head of the Main directorate of labour migration MS Tajikistan confirms Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> nasyal&apos;nika don&apos;t swear! </seg>
<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the central Asia republics, being going on salaries to Russia, confess that, a language of the country, into which but on own strive not only isn&apos;t known, is written with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it is their not so much guilt, as is trouble: few Turkmenians, the Uzbeks, the Tadjiks can allow itself to receive even the intelligent initial education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> However with their families one has nothing to even feed the children with not speaking already the fact to decently dress them, shoe and equip to a school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Growing to adolescent age such children at the first possibility depart on salaries. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of a language -, they confess. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel like humiliated and invalid&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> True with respect to a law of a language the human rights activists note one important moment. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If there is - no status neither the examination nor subsequent official work will be. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In the meantime the immigrant workers&apos; large part, as before, lives in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome, or an entrance to the Outsiders prohibited&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many of the newcomers assert that to receive an official status in our country is not so simple. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and the still same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Besides the legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And it is possible to make the here false registration quickly and only in one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The employees of the Russian police know that we in the main thing have the false documents, there is no registration, hence also the cases of extortion are. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Hundred, two is asked on the cigarettes, tea&quot; -, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov has shared with the journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Crash, don&apos;t begrudge, buy painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> In the first day of entry into the force of law of a language it turned out that not the only migrantskie documents about a registration could be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;lime-tree&quot; certificates about a pass of the language tests are withdrawn by the employees of the federal migration service already. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The false papers are printed on a common coloured printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners each of the migrants that were hoping in such a way to facilitate themselves a task of a pass of the tests has paid seven thousand roubles for a document haven&apos;t got them free:. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is by a factor of two-odd more expensive than the procedure of officially testing: she will cost the labour migrant to three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="636"> In the fact that the main task for the near future - protect a system against corruption, so that it is impossible just to buy &quot;the crusts&quot; both the representatives of the power and the human rights activists converge. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far the authorities can promise to the immigrant workers that haven&apos;t managed successfully to pass testing from the first time, the time of study of the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Work in spheres, not supposing active communication with the people, will be proposed to the, besides that newcomers not knowing a Russian. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Interior Ministry doesn&apos;t take the illegal market of the weapons into a revolution </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes with an application of the legal weapons is extremely small </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Interior Ministry of Russia proposes to toughen a law with respect to the owners of the civil weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It is a reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: Press when the shots at weddings have managed without the victims, also the massacre, made by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which, Press have perished 7 people. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The policemen want to forbid carrying of the nonlethal weaponry in the public places and increase the age is to from which possible receive a license on the weapons - since 18 years before 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The head of the Duma committee for security and counteraction to corruption Irina Yarovaya has supported and promised that the corrections of a law of the weapons would be made the State Duma in the quick future idea. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everybody is contented with the fact that the Russian authorities try to struggle with a problem by &quot;twirling of the nuts&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> The open letter of which - the authors the representatives of the different public rifle organizations - require to decline &quot;meaninglessly toughening&quot; has appeared on network. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percent of hooliganism with the registered weapons is the minimum, lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov has declared the Russian service of BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> In statistics of the Interior Ministry in six months of 2012 142 crimes with an application of a firearm, registered in the organs of the internal affairs, whereas only in the same period 1168 thousand crimes are fixed, are committed. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of an open letter are sure, which toughening of legislation in a sphere of the civil weapons doesn&apos;t place to suit the criminal on a &quot;black&quot; market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now to in Moscow find any weapons in not high price according to their words is possible. </seg>
<seg id="651"> In the meantime in the Interior Ministry it is asserted that a situation with dissemination of the illegal weapons is monitored. </seg>
<seg id="652"> The suppliers: from the plants to the officers </seg>
<seg id="653"> The &quot;black&quot; market of the weapons is refilled over several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The basic such channels are five, retired colonel Victor Baranets, tells having worked over ten years in a structure of the ministry of education and the General Staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> A screenshot of a site, receiving the orders for the weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first &quot;is army or military trace&quot;, i.e. the weapons which was stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;Both the Russian officers and the Caucasians - themselves dragged, *fir_club-moss* speaks, the weapons&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="658"> From the the next kind &quot;of the black weapons&quot; - stolen by the criminals representatives of the power structures. </seg>
<seg id="659"> *fir_club-moss* explains that here enter both carried off from the police magazines and stolen immediately from the employees of the law enforcement bodies. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal &quot;trunks&quot; go away from the military magazines into a sale. </seg>
<seg id="661"> The explosions often happened at many military magazines. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There are proved versions that the part of arsons was made specially - to shelter a shortage&quot; -, the former serviceman speaks. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The producers of the weapons according to the words of *fir_club-moss* introduce their mite. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now breed/multiply the private arm plants which don&apos;t meet a competition in an international market and throw out the weapons from under the flap on a black market, including of Moscow&quot; -, an expert tells. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One more source of &quot;black&quot; market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Especially many enter guns and the automata from the poor countries of, for example Kirghizia. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There there is the production occasionally makeshift, and the mafia, which has organized a stream, - the former serviceman explains, has been formed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="668"> From where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts have counted what an approximate share of each of the sources of deliveries of the illegal weapons on a &quot;black&quot; market is. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Its report in 2011 prepared the Center of problem analysis and state-managerial design. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The specialists have analyzed reporting of the Interior Ministry and the federal service, criminologic literature and open data of the portals on the arm themes statistics state. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The overwhelming part of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, enters from an army and the power departments. </seg>
<seg id="673"> The half of the whole weapons has turned out on a black market there &quot;over guilt of the officials whose work is connected with the weapons&quot;, is told in a report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to data of the researchers, 17 % of cases the weapons enter from the places of the armed conflicts, in 14 % of cases the larcenies happen at the phase of the production of the weapons, 5 % fall &quot;on black archaeology&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The seller-counselor of one of the arm shops assures having asked not to name its last name that nobody buys - the weapons, found by the black diggers, already for a long time too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The most often of all, as he speaks, the sellers go to a military magazine to get the new batch. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Across the warrant officer the person buys the unit, for example, the gun of the volumes. </seg>
<seg id="678"> She is checked out for him, is conveyed across a small fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;He transports her to the city and here sells at 900 euros for a piece with two shops&quot; -, he tells </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;True the police in knowledge of all affairs, therefore, periodically when, a plan over raskryvaemosti crimes, burns, conducts the test purchase from the dealers of the illegal weapons&quot; -, a counselor adds. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxurious shop&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer the most often of all find each other across the acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I peeped on the sites, into the blogs, as long as the comrade which has proposed to come to the platform &quot;Race&quot; where the person who will drive me away to &quot;a corner&quot; where we shall haggle will be hasn&apos;t responded. </seg>
<seg id="684"> I have recognized the price of a trunk only there </seg>
<seg id="685"> Military reviewer Victor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="686"> To come for me necessary the acquaintance who has an exit - a seller-counselor - U tells me such an acquaintance is, but I am not sure in him by the trunk. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The sellers on markets are, but to there come, is too necessary, it is conditional, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, which asked to report that with a daughter the tooth has fallen out&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> I now come by even couple of knuckledusters across a person in which sure. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He too delivers them only to me, because know that I shan&apos;t pass him. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The novices look for the weapons in the different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Victor Baranets tasted himself in a role of a buyer of the illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990th, when prepared an article on it for a publication. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes according to its words haven&apos;t varied. </seg>
<seg id="693"> &quot;Is the album approximately like the photographs where was all which pleasing&quot; of distance of him. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt as in a luxurious shop&quot; -, a serviceman recollects. </seg>
<seg id="695"> To a buyer according to the words of *fir_club-moss* isn&apos;t proposed a cat in a sack - it is still possible to taste. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, the potential client not just buy - we go with a seller to a forest, we there place target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I am granted a possibility to shoot, and we when I realize that the weapons beat well, begin to haggle&quot; - an expert describes a procedure. </seg>
<seg id="698"> The shop is on a sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> The searchers remove on the Internet on the sites and the groups into &quot;Vkontakte&quot; where it is proposed to buy the weapons &quot;for different aims&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> No documents and the personal meetings are necessary for it. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It is sufficient to have definite sum of money&quot;, - paints in an advertising cap with a site &quot;Buy the battle gun or an automaton&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The users leave their applications on him and ask the questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And will the minors be sold? </seg>
<seg id="704"> User &quot;Ivan&quot; (the spelling is saved) asks &quot;about without a license finite&quot; -. </seg>

<seg id="706"> The federal security service has now scattered about huge network of the false sites and rakes the ones that wish to buy the battle weapons with a spade. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The people walk as a hungry fish on feeding up and afterwards obtain coal in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> A military reviewer and the former military Victor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="709"> I heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered beyond the limits of action of Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The people receive the orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer across an ATM produces payment. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;Photography and an instruction the weapons - where are hidden, press secretary of a public organization &quot;Right of the weapons&quot; Dmitry Kislov tells, in answer are sent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets asserts that leaving an application on a site it is possible to remain without the weapons and get behind a grid. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The federal security service has now scattered about huge network of the false sites and rakes the ones that wish to buy the battle weapons with a spade. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The people walk as a hungry fish on feeding up and afterwards obtain coal - in Siberia&quot;, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov is for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> In a purchase of the illegal basic weapons it by estimations of the experts is possible to succeed in sum from 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to the words of Dmitry Kislova to acquire Makarov for 100-300 dollars from an organization &quot;Right of the weapons&quot;, the gun is possible. </seg>
<seg id="719"> One will have to expect a month-one and a half. </seg>

<seg id="723"> Through work on cash desk &quot;Makdonalds&quot; pass up to the quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> The wave of protest actions against low salaries in the department stores of the corporation of Walmart and the restaurants of popular networks of quick supply, such as &quot;of Makdonalds&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Tako Bell&quot;, &quot;Uendis&quot; and &quot;Kentucky frajd chiken&quot; in the last days took a ride around America. </seg>
<seg id="725"> As long as nobody starts to predict whether this wave into the ninth spindle will convert, or it is destined to be used up at early phases. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The shares support the trade unions and a number of the left public organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Creation in them of the trade-union organizations besides an increase of the modest salaries which ordinary employees Walmart and the systems of quick supply earn is aim of the organizers of the protests. </seg>
<seg id="728"> As long as this sector of economy almost isn&apos;t encompassed with trade-union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Actions began in the last week, after a Day of Thanksgiving, on the so named &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when on America came down orgy of the cheap sales that has captured millions of everymen and is being occasionally accompanied by brawls. </seg>
<seg id="731"> In this day some employees of the corporation of Walmart in which from the whole world 2,2 million people work abandoned their work places and picketed the shops of a corporation whose goods raschitan on the people of modest and middle sufficiency together with the trade unions and the left activists. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart vends everything in the world, from the diapers, the hunting rifles and the automobile batteries before the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its shops on the average from 8 % to 27 % are cheaper than in the large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore many menial employees Walmart issue goods only with them at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Walmart has made one of the largest corporations of America availability and the assortment of goods. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words of the critics goods podeshevke can allow selling of Walmart to itself partly because few pay to its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The last also complain about the heavy conditions of labour, for example on a shortage of the lift-trucks or the hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of actions on &quot;the Black Friday&quot; required to increase salary and complained about the fact that the cost of medical insurance, granted by the corporation, has hopped since 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Typical employee Walmart, receiving 9,5 dollars per hour, this expense not over a pocket, they spoke. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The scientists from the Californian university in Berkeley prove that if srednuyuyu Walmart increases salary up to 12 dollars per hour it will cost the corporation in 3,2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is about 1,1 % larger than she spends on salary now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart wholly shifts growth of salaries on the buyers&apos; shoulders then each visit to a shop will manage with it only 46 cents dearer. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they will spend 12,39 dollars on some more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Partisans Walmart enough it is noted that protest actions have happened only in nine states and haven&apos;t deposited a corporation nor malejshchego damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;The black Friday&quot; lasted in her shops 8 hours of evening on Thursday before midnight of the next day, and in this time Walmart sold about 5000 goods into a second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Altogether its cash apparatuses produced almost 100 million transactions on &quot;the Black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The, the representative of a corporation Dan Fogelman asserted in an interview, left site of Huffington Post that the work places has abandoned altogether &quot;less five&quot; of employees Walmart, and what protest action was only &quot;the next PR trick&quot; of with it trade the union that has organized. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;The free cash desk&quot;! </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued in this week in New York, where not department their stores Walmart (they in this progressive city aren&apos;t conferred, and there are therefore no them here so far) but the &quot;Makdonaldsy&quot; is also different cheap restaurants were the object. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Makdonalds says that he sells billions of portions, and after it he even doesn&apos;t give a hospital to you and don&apos;t pay to you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumejn Williams, the member of the town Soviet of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At a given moment the minimum salary according to federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The restaurants of quick supply with the time increase, but her only slightly, also on the average, their ordinary employees receive 8,90 dollars per hour in New York. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody earns fewer than them in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> It is incomprehensible to as it is possible to exist in New York on such money me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Long ago across &quot;Makdonaldsy&quot; passed nearly the quarter of the American teenagers who earned additionally behind their counters after a school living at it with the parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw the basic source of subsistence in it or planned to be delayed there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I permanently come across an interview of the employees &quot;of Makdonaldsov&quot; who complain that he must live on this salary and occasionally even feed the children on it. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, at a forum of the newspaper of Wall Street Journal the comment the author of which notices that it is irresponsible to acquire the children if you don&apos;t know on what you will feed them hangs. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants of protest actions which have begun in 6.30 of the morning on Thursday at &quot;Makdonaldsa&quot; in the 40th street and in 15 dollars per hour an avenue required that to the cashiers and the cooks of the system of quick supply had begun to pay Madison-at least, i.e. more than has reduplicated their present minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also required that in a sphere of quick supply the trade-union organizations had been created. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The American law forbids to an administration to obstruct it and punish the activists of trade-union movement with cavils and dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand the administration seldom facilitates them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But encompass quick supply with the trade union in a complicated manner and for the objective causes. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - unusual fluidity of the frames. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Dissentient </seg>
<seg id="767"> The noisy protests took place in this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Culmination of the share has been the next to the Times-public garden on which several local politicians-democrats appeared in the middle of day &quot;Makdonaldsa&quot; has the meeting in particular the member of the town Soviet Dzhumejn Williams that has declared: &quot;Makdonalds&quot; says that he sells billions of portions, and after it he even didn&apos;t give a hospital to you and don&apos;t pay to you for honest work&quot;!. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Also the different eminent New York democrats the, for example candidate for an office of the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio that has declared that &quot;we must together enter a support of the employees of quick supply with the fact that they have attained just payment and the economic well-being which each New Yorker deserves&quot; have supported the demonstrators!. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As New York Times have characterized having happened it was the largest share of such a kind in the history of an American sphere of quick supply. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But in her participated only several hundreds of people, in which besides far not all of them were the employees of quick public catering borrowed, there are tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Whether as long as it is unclear this spark will generate flame of mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;So far to deceive the brain turns out so-so&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> In the last time it is accepted to perceive the theme of supplemented reality, popular among the admirers of modern technologies, in the main thing across a prism of the special spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Have shown the model, at first in summer at one&apos;s yearly conference active, to Google, and then in November became known that had submitted application of a proper patent also to Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> It however follows that for the scientists of the given company the points are passed phase the talk with the leader of a group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharamom Izadi. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Perspective of manipulation with the virtual objects in air of the naked arms, creation of virtual open spaces beckons them. </seg>
<seg id="778"> -Tell, please, in the common lines with what your research group deals? </seg>
<seg id="779"> -We deal with interaction between a person with the machines, but we in this case try to space the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far the mankind in mass stuck at the phase of the work on pixels on the plane screen, occasionally *addressing_in_rude_manner* in them by the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to peep for 5-10 years ahead and guess drastic changes of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The, for example prefix of Xbox and sensors Kinect is step ahead, and Xbox esteem not one today, without Kinect don&apos;t sell oneself for the gestural control is everything interesting. </seg>
<seg id="783"> -What else expects us ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> -Notwithstanding the fact that Kinect has transfered interaction on the physical level hitherto happen on the plane screen, occasionally much into 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> A withdrawal input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and so far not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change it, we work on the truly three-dimensional systems of reflection in a base of different technologies, including of projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to let out the computer world into us, physical, make him more palpable. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It is however necessary for it to recognize not only a user, but space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we shall be able to supplement the real world with the virtual objects in a much more comfortable form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And primarily - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> -What do you think about the vocal control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A popular piece, but isn&apos;t she overestimated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> -Definitely to name him panacea - a question of privacy stands because one not always wants to notify others about the actions and intentions is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact all kinds of interaction with the computers are good, but each in their niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example for the control of the devices in the public places we had the project in the frames of which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping, but so stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In this case gestures were removed not to a chamber of the device, but the wrist bracelet which fixed movements of the bones and the muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> As long as he is large, but theoretically to reduce him to the size of the wrist hours is possible. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general the future rests with mixed type of the control, for example zhest+golos. </seg>
<seg id="799"> -It as? </seg>
<seg id="800"> -For example as will you ask me to convey this jar of fizzy water to you? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will say and you simultaneously will show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> -I usually just speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> -It on this will be very complicated to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> -Do i.e. you want to make the users adapt oneself what can, or cannot the machine for a given moment? </seg>
<seg id="805"> -This reciprocally drawing together, but is quite optional. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think, in the near future we in the main thing shall have to work on the development of new types of the sensors which will allow more precisely defining of the person&apos;s reactions. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It can be the, for example laser sensors, they give quite good permission in depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> -If one speaks your work on the sensors Xbox you have the which is Kinect complaints about the modern chambers? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Isn&apos;t there enough resolution, depth or else anything? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The present generation - is in a principle one, is to to which possible push off in our work on three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, well obtain mega pixels by 8 with speed 1000 to/ of the sec.. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But an affair not in mega pixels, and as a matrix also the depth themselves. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From the last viewpoint all present technologies are us insufficiently good - it adds works for the designers of the algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is i.e. necessary to remember not only about Z permission over the axes X and Y, but. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed of the number of frames per second is also very important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Enough for the person&apos;s movement is dynamic, and the present 30 to/, it from is frankly a bit too small especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Betishes from our Redmondskoj laboratory has made a sensor of touch the adjusted delay of treatment - from 1 to 100 ms, and the modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everybody understands to what extent it influences interaction between a person and the machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> The equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touches that the frames per second were more, in my work would prove useful to me very much. </seg>
<seg id="820"> -And to increase the number of chambers is not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> -Into Kinect now is, of which three &quot;cameras&quot;, are one in fact - the infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of a reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the here already third chamber -, properly speaking, is a common sensor of visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> She doesn&apos;t apply for definition of the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> The potentially *greater* number of chambers would be able to solve a problem </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or aggravate her increasing the necessary volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be quite good to create flexible analog Kinect, poigrat&apos;sya with curvature, how it will help to see, dispositions of the chambers and in three-dimensional definition of a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> -The as far as I remember, to Microsoft, unlike Google, didn&apos;t present public my spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Doesn&apos;t it seem that from a viewpoint of everyday use of technologies of supplemented reality the spectacles are one of the most promising platforms to you? </seg>
<seg id="829"> -I think: the, of course, all time to wake up holding a smartphone in the raised arms not very comfortably, but here what &quot;passing&quot; supplemented reality would be when on the basis of the cloudy platform you would be able to switch from the spectacles to a smartphone, projective display also further everywhere the steepest version. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The spectacles - very personal arrangement, their in it force (only you see the private things) and simultaneously the weakness - supplemented reality on the basis of the spectacles won&apos;t allow you to work on the virtual objects jointly with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> -We shall imagine for a minute that the manipulation with the virtual holographic objects in air is accessible not only to Tony Starku from &quot;the Iron Person&quot;, but a simple mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem on which the critics of such often indicate are ideas: there is no tactile recall! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The arms don&apos;t feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers does your group prepare on this call? </seg>
<seg id="835"> -In my lectures I often say that the supplemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in succession in interaction between a person and a machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The I think eighth addition of the tactile feelings quite can become. </seg>
<seg id="837"> So far one of the interesting tricks is use of the second arm as a peculiar undercoat for an image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She excellently registers pressing! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies which indeed are directed on addition &quot;to here these pictures in air&quot; of tangibility -, for example the interference of several directional ultrasound rays in a definite point where the finger, is, a feeling, gives, but so far it is very weak - like to you have blown on the hassocks. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets on the wrists which influence for nervous completions in the fingers - the too promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> -And did you try to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think that he feels the fact that, does it seem, have to feel at that moment, when it sees anything? </seg>
<seg id="843"> -Here it is good idea, we haven&apos;t tasted yet to so make. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lurks one more task one over which is in for fighting else long - how make a person, physically being in very limited space, come to believe that he walks over open, practically infinite - we work and over the concepts of race tracks (quite not such as in the clubs), the moving platforms, as well as the huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> As long as deceive the brain turns out so-so works, more very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Here what does the work on virtual reality of such, attractive to a researcher - many things in the absolutely rudimentary state. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Lack of objective criteria is instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; *CONTINUE* *PROJECT1* &quot;Petersburg *VANGUARD*&quot;, *DEDICATE* *TOWNSPEOPLE*, *WHICH1* *BE* ahead, at the *CUT1* edge *CULTURE1* and *ART1*. </seg>
<seg id="849"> There is a given top list in the grass-snake the bright workers, whose achievements the scenes of Petersburg go out beyond the frames of the city often finding confession in Europe passing All-Russian fame burn *art*-. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero &quot;of Rosbalta&quot; is scandalizing artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city knows Kirill Miller - the bearded person dressed into still red who occurs sometimes at the Russian museum, and sometimes the Summer garden, has one on the fashionable gatherings and exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The pictures of Kirill Miller always gather the crowds of the spectators where they wouldn&apos;t expose themselves. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the particularly Petersburg social-philosophic tale-tellers, the creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller - it is a bright person of Petersburg vanguard of the end of the 80th is beginnings of the 90th. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Besides that he is a person of the city, by his appearance in the streets evoking smile at the townspeople, raising all mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He has recently taken a piano-organ and has become the Petersburg organgrinder into the arms for have matured for this complicated role whole his Bohemian existence, philosophy and an image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> -Kirill, and why do you nevertheless go around the city in everything red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> -I have chosen red colour as a designer, dealing with the kind and an image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world red colour is compromise between the artist, imidzhmejkerom and a society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although there is everything that is slightly not gray in the society cause aggression and excitation of an unkind property. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are directed on the fact that a talk has begun. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions is invitation to discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> -And when you understood that you must be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> -On exhibition in the club Neva where my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I have understood that it is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of the old free unofficial artists passed, and, new, free a fellow me true stories are unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I have begun to be on the friendly terms with with the artists of the new wave, from postgazonevshchinoj which has brought to &quot;Pushkin-,the 10&quot;, also larger wave wasn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I throw to a theatre, the clothes, music, into all genres, except a word. </seg>
<seg id="869"> -And all of it has united in your Art clinic - it was important for Me to find oneself at the center of culture of Petersburg where all the best creative forces must gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied the territory, on Pushkin-10, and there, as long as repair, wasn&apos;t existed the musical-artistic club, the Bohemian club, the house of Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were: born the nomes, I remember, as a Cord have brought Tekila jazz with the project &quot;van Gogh&apos;s Ear&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The cord and his friends sang easy songs under plywood, they were in covering the pants, there was fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin among them. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play *alive* she has become &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg was a host of many programmes before khali-galivskikh times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We have given Trakhtenberga to them, and his great career, has gone, and the basic education and upbringing he has received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> A gallery &quot;D. 137&quot;, the club &quot;Griboedov is aftersounds from Art-a clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our employees and the haunters have gone away. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of yesterday&apos;s century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> The polling was in 2000 in the press, the prize was &quot;the People of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In nomination &quot;Artist of the year&quot; I was named, my culmination has ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> To work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century, in new times over the old rules is comfortless. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity divide, it is possible to be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> -A recognizable fashion is inherent in your works. </seg>
<seg id="884"> -Many my pictures are the hits, relevance, by them brightly expressed, and is sharpness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I shall have programme exhibition, &quot;the Russian museum in the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I earlier was social, now to be such - it is sick is also fearful. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns everything gets smeared, the tragism films. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I like grotesque, I have sanserif ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example rescue of the world by a totalitarian disguise in the order order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Over *clothes* is now met orientating oneself to external mechanics, and not an internal person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, maybe, to to him give the hand is impossible and to into erysipelas spit is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the deception will be removed with the help of a disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> -And we have recently seen you in a role of an urban organgrinder - the Cultural city must have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who as not me, them must be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> -Well can, and can the commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> -Now commercial art must be accurate, tactful sweet course. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Disintegration of cultures takes place. </seg>
<seg id="899"> The people were earlier beaten at the flocks, Bohemia liked, one, the simpletons, are other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Everybody has now broken into the micro communities, now everybody with difficulty will like. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred dollar scrap of paper to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="902"> It now is necessary to think whom will please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> 100 admirers&apos; now at each cult hero each. </seg>
<seg id="904"> -And Stasa Mikhaylov comes on in several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> -On him come broshenki, there sex-social sphere works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand won&apos;t come, and there is a less management, money, everything withers away in the total. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have the admirers, it is the main thing not to deceive them, not spoil acquired. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I in adolescence painted such pictures that they hung the wall next to Falck and Larionov at one collector. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I have begun with the pictures in which is usually finished. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Notions are often now confounded. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Spiritual culture, culture of consumption are told:. </seg>
<seg id="912"> No culture is, at consumption, it from the other opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a person of yesterday culture, have grown on the examples of the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, declined money for the sake of drawing of the pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for such here a culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> -Kirill, enough what for Petersburg there isn&apos;t? </seg>
<seg id="916"> -The good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a notion: the official from culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not each of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the correct Tsars everything not so was, reign maybe, wasn&apos;t understood in culture very much, but they understood that it was necessary to hold the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Now there are the good counselors here in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="921"> With us in Petersburg the people are, which could to be the experts, but they shut, for the higher experts who correctly will estimate these experts and will give a road to them are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now vkusovshchinka prospers. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but distinguish them, other museums who they honestly say that we receive not the whole modern art are such artists must look for ourselves for the fact that. </seg>
<seg id="924"> -What such for you is Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> -Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow cultures are much larger, there soil is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And the on our stones art grow finds it hard. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Cultural soil is for us necessary, and with us the writers now are more than the readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Which here in Europe many asking people go on exhibitions, the concerts very much. </seg>
<seg id="929"> With us this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> It is for us necessary to make fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is realized on means for the grant from St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> To bear in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Ground is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Globally warming or collision with an asteroid-murderer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> The caravans of the spaceships with the Earthmen on a board depart in search for a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Does the main question to save the mankind stand as continue its kind in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> The in fact real planets are only two is to which possible master at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is Venus and is Mars&quot; -, senior scientific worker of the State astronomical institute of the name of P.. K.. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin believes. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if there are the conditions, more suitable for life, on Mars then on the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> To live is possible only at great height or on Venus&apos; orbit in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> One has begun to approach the questions of reproduction in space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Experiments with the plants were half a century ago yet carried out. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of the pea, grown on an orbit, didn&apos;t differ in anything from their earth sorts. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Sweat - deduction on an orbit of the insects, the tiny fruit flies-drosophilas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 the quails&apos; eggs to space sent to check how the embryo in the conditions of weightlessness develops. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We receive on an exit of the absolutely normal nestling. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And the problem here further begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> The &quot;one&apos;s to also begin to move -, explain, is the problem, connected with the fact that this nestling must find a support, it must rise to, the legs&quot;, head of the laboratory of the Institute of the medical-biological problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding a support the nestlings disorderly somersaulted. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And the full atrophy of instincts in 10 hours happened at the newborns. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The nestlings didn&apos;t react to light and a sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was in the fact that in four days they were just killed. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;The also two times we goggled nestlings after it have refused, because it is just impossible there to with them work&quot; -, Vladimir Sychev states a failure of experiment with the nestlings in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With the animals the last time the biological &quot;mini ark&quot; flew to an orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In spring experiments will continue the years 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However there will be only the unisexual individuals on the bio satellite &quot;Bion&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Experiment with the rats who were sent to space already with a fruit was. </seg>
<seg id="959"> Nothing supernatural in a principle there hasn&apos;t been detected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It has just been on the bio satellites, but it, again -, it is necessary to carry - out unitary experiment, also such investigations&quot;, Vladimir Sychev notes. </seg>
<seg id="961"> The posterity after a landing has appeared at the space rats. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But one so far cannot approach the problem of breeding immediately in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not a simple task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals losing just cannot realize the habitual habitat own instinct is the waiter. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The person unlike the little animals in a principle can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo Sapiens possesses an abstract mind, and able to create proper emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Experiments, in ethical considerations similar, aren&apos;t carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women fly already 50 years to space. </seg>
<seg id="969"> *Tereshkova* had the greatest risk. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And most precious, which the mankind, has, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Seagull has flown away, and nobody on the earth would be able to say: whether it will remain after a flight to space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> She will manage to bear a child after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;However nobody answered - with this question&quot;, a veteran of space missile branch *Vakhtang* Vachnadze speaks. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June of the year, 1964 whole in a year after a flight to space the first woman-astronaut Valentine Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> Father of Andriyan child Nikolaev also was an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 the son to the second woman-astronaut Svetlana Savickaya that has twice visited an orbit and has even worked in open space was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have the unit is few exist the astronauts at whom after the prolonged flights everything has managed, and a healthy generation grows. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights&quot;, - the space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, leads up a total in Hera to Russia of *VALERIA* Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And it is nevertheless for the mankind necessary to look for some new ways in biotechnologies, protection against radiation, creation of artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hydro laboratory of the Astronaut Training Center is the obligatory phase of preparation for a flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the conditions of zero floatation the astronauts work off skills in work in open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water imitates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If, is water, although also comfortable for adult but nevertheless alien medium then for the sucklings - the native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ikhtiandry like confirm - that the life has gone out from ocean to the land. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months at the mom into the okoplodnoj liquids, he finds it easier to get accustomed afterwards to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is in a principle logical, because from a moment of birth, from a moment of that first bathe pass in all 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It that something is very few that to forget&quot; -, instructor of suckling swimming Marina Aksenova speaks. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, gravitation, gravity if for a born child weightlessness is the more natural state then for a woman - are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly the muscles of the belly, the pelvis in weightlessness become senescent, an ability in pushing out of a fruit decreases. </seg>
<seg id="991"> We well OK shall lower also it relying upon the stimulators of generic activity. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is possible, of course, in a special chamber to go on the kinds, she will push him out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And what - ask the nontrivial questions of *VALERIA* Polyakov is further&quot;.? </seg>
<seg id="994"> Artificial gravitation on the other hand is for a child too necessary. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not feeling earth attraction the body won&apos;t form the skeleton and a muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> It is impossible as an adult to dress the newborn on an orbit in the special load suit for trainings. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He just will be deprived of the fact that for him it will be vitally necessary. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, on which we with you shall go the allowing of birth of the child in an allogenic medium will result in the fact that we shall bring an invalid to the earth completely dezadaptirovannogo the person&quot; - the head of a committee for bioethics IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov foresees. </seg>
<seg id="999"> As long as the birth of the children in space is a question of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However after the time it will be reality, when the Earthmen will depart by its ships to the far planet which will become a house for their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> A head of the Main test-revisional control: the Checkup of the Schwarz system has fallen through over the politicians&apos; guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In a branch of the state purchases Czechia has the good organs of the control and, notwithstanding the presence of quality legislation at its disposal, lags behind its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This declaration of *Miroslav* of *FAECES*, the vice-president of the supreme test-revisional administration from an interview for the site Aktualne.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn&apos;t - enough for us which, has commented on the current situation of *FAECES*, apply&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of the control grants the similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> An approach of Peter Nechasa to the so named Schwarz system as an example of wrong practice is led. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Has recently the prime minister declared, what GDP (the Civil democratic party) won&apos;t worry the businessmen with the checkups - it goes out forbidden or resolved? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the institutions, to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations&quot; - state, *FAECES*. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a session of the revisional committee in the deputies&apos; Chamber you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German sides in the frames of which the legislation on the state purchases of both countries was juxtaposed. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> About what specifically did the matter concern? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is meant that the parallel checkup which we have begun probably, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> More simply speaking, about the fact that European legislation asserts speech, in what way have to study, the state purchases, are further, also an application in practice follows national legislation and afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> The whole information was acquired also even in an else unfinished checkup, have transpired interesting differences - more simply speaking the legislation with us can be &quot;the precise and unerring&quot;, however in a practician of an application we in some parameters are inferior to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows that it is insufficient to create still more, and more are the precised rules, it is necessary to concentrate on an application of law itself it. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And can the properly how given project help you, what does he mean for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a joint control can make a contribution to the efforts in a stop of rectification of laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it doesn&apos;t lead to positive result. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy means reception of a proper thing for fair (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But it is not the fact that we shall reach it decreasing a restriction on the orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system will overflow &quot;the papers&quot; so that ones who will wish to find loop-holes in a given system will find them much lighter than if the restriction hasn&apos;t gone down. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak the internal problems of a practical application of legislation on the state purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> And how does the system of the control in Germany function? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Does such an organization as us of Crewe (the Test-revisional control) exist there, or does it work otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What concerns the institutions one there acts as as our Crewe, Bundesrechnungshof, is made according to our principle, the board, working a little differently, also exists, but in the main thing both institutions function similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Besides that the authorities are before the definite degree similar, but there since Germany has a federal structure, one there are subdivisions of an audit and at the level of the federal lands - in it their system somewhat differs from us. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can control only federal money, we have state means at our disposal. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds in our regions and the municipalities are monitored at the level of the federal audit chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What concerns local legislation there more simply than at us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I wouldn&apos;t want to compare without particular data, but in some relation to take Germany behind a sample, but it is impossible to definitely say that it is better in everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Is it so, because they better cope with the control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely isn&apos;t, but I shall be repeated, similar to me comparisons don&apos;t please. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it is necessary to say that even the exemplary countries face many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise wouldn&apos;t they gain any advantage from cooperation with our office probably? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If speak internal legislation then how has one been reflected on your institution of a correction of a Law of the state purchases, in any way are consequences manifested? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Taking into account that the legal force of these corrections is enough short she in any way yet hasn&apos;t been manifested in our works on the control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> For we conduct the control over a fact it is necessary to take some delay into account. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We take it into account only in a process of preparation of the future checkups - we have begun to use our new instrument &quot;detection of unthrift risk&quot; across which we have passed almost 14000 state contracts We have analyzed them There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the restrictions, change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on vary. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> How do you count the assertion this law will bring benefit or the additional load of a system of a bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law certainly is step in a correct direction, and, I hope, it will be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem which can arise is such that the rules &quot;will toughen&quot;, and it will be impossible to observe them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> The enterprises, in functioning of the previous rules monitored, are bound with a supplier (for example, the regional operative programmes - with regional advice) in the fact that any nonobservance of a law of the state purchases means violation of budget discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Stand in such an opportunity to toughen a law in such a way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> What I think in not this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude ones who want to capture and abuse, but not punish ones who make a formal mistake, not influencing a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system only will create the some more *greater* pressure on a bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And whereas go out from this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us realize that this way nowhere won&apos;t bring. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Has recently the prime minister declared that GDP won&apos;t worry the businessmen with the checkups of the so named Schwarz system, What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is &quot;the Schwarz system&quot; forbidden or resolved? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the organs to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It is possible to say: &quot;We shall change this law and we shall resolve it&quot;, but it is impossible to say that will pretend, as if nothing happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law of the state purchases contains the enough obligatory rules as also what must be formally conducted, and it, correctly It will protect the state purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of the formal shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn&apos;t enough for us which, apply. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are in some places slippery, but in the main thing passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> There are the roads that have frozen and snow-covered in some places of Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> They are in the main thing passable, but somewhere with *greater* caution. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> The Karlovy Vary territory </seg>
<seg id="1058"> Today in the morning in the Karlovy Vary territory the roads were passable, but somewhere having frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperature has decreased since five before ten degrees lower than zero, but during a day have to little by little grow warmer. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The snowfall has stopped in the region only a small layer lies in the depressions. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> However on the spines of the Ore mountains lie about 30 centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> From information, obtained from the regional road workers, have become known that there was lower visibility because of fog in some places. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The fast highway R6 and the roads of the first class in the region currently are passable without the restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Attentiveness is however necessary, for example on the bridges where the surface can be having frozen over and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Also all roads, relating to the second and third class of including the mountain routes, are passable. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> But the remains of snow that has frozen and by the places worn out all else lie on their some areas. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> It is especially for attentive necessary to be on the roads, situated on heights. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Shimon Ornest: On the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that the end of light must begin less than in a month? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It-is only one of the many alarming news, on which we, the people, so easily *come_across*. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Together with a group of The Tap Tap we permanently joke on this theme and we say that we are the sole group in the world which will be able to assemble sufficiently positive energy to defer or prevent the end of light. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> More than that in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts are against the end of light. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Would you be able more in more detail to tell about it the readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> The matter concerns about the nationwide action of collection of means which we plan here already during two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We have decided to use the marketing potential which a calendar of the Maya on the end of which announced on 21 December into 11: 10 possesses. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> In a day before this event, the 20th December in 21: 00 three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava parallelly start. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end, roughly speaking, at that moment, when there is an hourly zone of which on the island of *Kiribati* in the Pacific ocean, 12 hours earlier than at us, the May calendar will finish. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> For whom has this idea come to the head? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Primordially it was my idea, we further invented everything together with our artist Gonzoj Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Besides the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and prevent the end of light we also want together with a community to think over in what state we once shall convey this world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of completion of the May calendar we have created unique collection of the items the footwear, the sport shirts, the bags and the original keys against the end of light, to buy These things on the site www.e-tap.cz and by that together show a support to us is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group of The Tap Tap has together with other musicians also executed anthem against the end of the light which is called &quot;the End of light is canceled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Will sound the anthem on these benefit performance concerts, having already liked the listeners YouTube? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the very end if in a total everything turns out, and the end of light won&apos;t begin. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> All performers on all concerts will begin to sing him simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Anthems simultaneously will sound also in live broadcast of Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words to this song has written and has played Jesus&apos; role in a clip Tomasz Ganak, X participate in execution also of Xindl </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How have you begun to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, since we take many charitable actions and the concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try actively to switch them to these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has turned out that many like with us to work, are interesting to them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> On what help from a concert against the end of light will go? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> On a purchase of the equipment bezbar&apos;ernogo the educational center STUDEO, the already sixth year we so work with civil union Tap in Edlichki institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of Edlichki institute and take cheerful and interesting actions with them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves haven&apos;t means to depart to the teachers, and we try in such a way to grant this possibility to them. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> The building into which we shall move with this project within the framework of the project of an additional construction of Edlichki institute will arise separately in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> On each concert several musical groups and the performers will come forward. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What were criteria for selection? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to be the programme which will attract all generations of including the children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example in Prague will appear Chinaski Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere from Danom *Bart* The Tap Tap, Mar&apos;yan Bango and Irzhi is Dry. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> To all details find out on the site www.kpks cz is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you plan any similar &quot;grandiose actions&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May will appear for the first time on festival &quot;Prague spring&quot; and we here, of course, shall prepare an interesting programme with the interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In the next year we with pleasure would give performance in a Czech national house in New York, and I personally, already if we are in the USA, would want to appear in Washington and Chicago very much. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About the foreign countries with you the serious plans, you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The group of The Tap Tap is a group of the people with the limited possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you cope with a road from a viewpoint of the organization and logistics?? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so fearful, as seems on the first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> With us five participants on the electric invalid carriages, their carriages must journey in the baggage section, in addition of everything are the large quantity of the cargo and the boxes with the instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, as long as the Czech airlines CSA coped with it without the problems, and British airlines British Airways always perfectly are prepared for true story for us what me how much once amazed. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow from where we have recently returned everything went without the problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Due to departures abroad you can compare the different countries from a viewpoint of availability, the attitude of the community to the invalids and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What did you face to the present moment? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other countries where everything functions better than at us, in Russia we have become the witnesses of the fact that in the east everything else is at the basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> The independent movement of the person on an electric invalid carriage at the center of the city in comparison with Prague in Moscow, very many barriers, are also here still is into wonder some more. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Not in run such banal things as concede a road to an invalid in a lift are also there. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> The public organizations which try to pay attention of the people to the problems of the people of the limited possibilities fortunately arise also there already. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And with what, permanently must conversely we catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Very many things is the level of execution of which far behind are. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to precise that the improvement and the improvement of a situation always depend on the efforts of those people whom it concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid it is quite normal that the people with a heavy form of disability independently move in the streets, can come down to a toilet, to a museum, yes where *please* </seg>
<seg id="1160"> The fact that the large number of people with the limited possibilities takes active part in public life, we outpace them with The Tap Tap a little it there is not very widespread! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect to a community or bezbar&apos;ernost&apos; is one thing, but at a moment, when among us will appear the known sportsmen, the artists, the actors, the politicians or the lawyers, then everything also really will begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as it is the unitary cases - the people with strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group of The Tap Tap currently is very popular, but shall we return for two years back, what in 1998 made you organize her? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I have entered Edlichki institute as an educator, there were many young people who wanted to start to deal with something around me. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since me the musician himself and I play including and on a saxophone, the interesting musical circlet has together with a colleague organized that. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and with the time, as our host speaks, Making ready this Angelovich, a little have got out of the control (laugh). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Did the popularity come only in the last years, or do I confound anything? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is truth, the fact that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively work on a propaganda of a group has helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We have drawn a conclusion that the work which nobody can estimate in essence like exists. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Due to means for the European union we can allow ourselves the skilled teachers, the equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did the aim so well to promote The Tap Tap face you? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the very beginning I felt their potential in an ability to make something unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In Shaw-business is full of augural, imitating each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, everything new begins with caution, and lasts for it long. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Very few rare things, but I shall dare to say that Tap Tap is alone exist from them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression with the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this pity is perfectly excessive, because the people with the limited possibilities don&apos;t appear any suffering and all abandoned personalities which we must grudge. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live full-fledged life and develop, of course, only provided they possess the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if the people with disability something can it is shift not only for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has the fact that you are the strict leader to which you many believe insured success? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do work qualitatively we must be in many things uncompromising and hold definite discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I believe that it is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic presentation and fly in the clouds, and when it is found, out that two times per week are they have to go on rehearsals to attend preparatory courses and spend much time in a road, the enthusiasm is very quickly lost. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But so happen in any group which wants to work and reach something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The current in composition of the group of The Tap Tap 20 people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How much they were at the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only alone Making ready Angelovich. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, the people come and go away, to prevent it is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For ones who have a wish and the force of will our doors always are opened. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He will take place up to the expected end of light, on Thursday 20.12.2012 into 21 00 in a day. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will take place in Prague at stadium Incheba, to Brno - in the club Fleda and Ostrava - at the center of Plynojem with participation of 12 groups and other musicians of Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In termination of a concert all three cities are bound the TV bridge at a moment of execution of song of the group of The Tap Tap &quot;the End of light is canceled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the given project - gather financial means in volume is 25 million crowns on a purchase multifunctional bezbar&apos;ernogo of the equipment of the educational center STUDEO at the institute of Edlichki in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The ticket for a concert costs 400 crowns, for the children before 12 years the free entrance, to acquire the Tickets beforehand into Bohemiaticket is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> In the last week at a session of the ministers of the European space agency Poland was received by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after Czechia which became a full-fledged member of the European Space Agency on 12 September 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland has begun close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and during the subsequent years has taken active part in the row of the projects of an agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But Poland has begun the way to space much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before the Second world war yet the Polish enthusiasts dealt with the trips to space, but not always it met understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I shall resemble, for example about a lecture by A.. Sternfeld who on 6 December 1933 represented in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from my innovative work &quot;Introduction astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of a young engineer (the yr 1905 of river) have left an audience for indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recollected that only doctor Jan Gadomskij had been interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In the year 1934 in France Sternfeld won a prize of Robert Esno-Pel&apos;tri and Andre Louis Khirsha for &quot;Introduction astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Doctor Jan Gadomskij (1899 - 1966) about whom was told higher has later become the great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He has published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and has written the row of the books, dedicated by it to scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskij has become the known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was estimated including by the fact that one of the craters on a reverse side of the Moon was named in its honour. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 in Poland the railway railcar, equipped with the rocket engine, was built. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Regretfully the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as also a detail on the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether even, for acceleration or for braking of a wagon the rocket had to be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information on this railcar is known only from the press of that epoch. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> The Polish artillery has begun with 1933 to ponder the rocket arrows. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The Section on technique of armament in cooperation with professors Mechislavom Vol&apos;fke and Gustavus Mokzhitskim realized investigation. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> One from the materials that have remained can see that investigations have reached before the stage of the practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with coming of the German troops works were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> The idea of the photo-electric rocket-destroyer which the *Rogozin* engineer has proposed, and in the next year the work &quot;the Air rocket-torpedo and the aviation rocket-bomb&quot; of author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo went out in 1937 appeared in specialized print. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of the rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> The Temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated the whole work before war itself dealt with all projects of military use of rocket engineering. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was formed in 1937, but the work has ended after two years of its activity because of the beginning of war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work, dedicated to astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after a war, due to the work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> 1954 years of the magazine &quot;of a Problem&quot; in which four volumetric articles on astronautics are published for the first time are mentioned in November number about a society. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them professor M Subotovich has proposed to found the society which will deal with astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> In that time the projects of the artificial satellites already grew, and it was clear that space investigations were a promising branch. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> From the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (POA) tried to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and in already autumn POA became her actual member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the next year the first chairman POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became a deputy of the chairman of the International federation of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He remained on this job before most his death which has come in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since the year 1956 POA have made a significant contribution to the development of the tremendously successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which has become the first Polish rocket that has executed scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launching has taken place 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 metres, was into the length about 80 centimetres, and its weight equalled less than 5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Hereafter the improved version RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 the tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were given on the Bledovskom vacant plot. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket was into the length about 1,4 metres, and its weight equalled about 11,5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the rocket was even able to do the present scientific work - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14,5 kilometres, and observation of the high altitude wind was its task. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962 farther development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> A rocket Meteor-1, developed in a period between 1962 and 1965 years, has become the heiress of the first rockets of type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its common length equalled 510 centimetres, and the initial weight is 32,5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three types, (designated as a Meteor-,1A 1V and-1S) which differed in the size of the chamber for the scientific equipment were developed. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had space of the volume of 0,4 liters at its disposal, the Meteor-1V is 0,34 liters, and the Meteor-1S - 0 62l. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of the flight at all three types was 37 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In a period between 1965 and 1968 the years in the Aviation institute took place the development of a rocket Meteor-2, and its first flying tests have begun in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 with the starting weight of 380 kilograms was capable of deducing a useful cargo of the weight 10 kilograms on the height about 60 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then the versions Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is worth mentioning also about entry of Poland into KOSPAR (the Committee for space investigations) in the year 1960 and creation of the national committee KOSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Besides that there is Inter space within the framework of the programme, Poland participated in investigations to space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot *Miroslav* Germashevskij became the second inter astronaut after Vladimir Remeka. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The cancellation of a law of public works is not a solution of a problem. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the last week the constitutional court annuled a law of public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decree has caused lively discussion in a society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It surely will be interesting to glance at given problem range from a wider viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberally-oriented economic systems in EU also as also in the globalized world are based on the principle of a plural, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence it means that the separate economic subdivisions, the national economic systems are in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and movement, to free anything not restricted, of the private capital together with ungovernable financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Price tension arises as a result of considerable difference in the cost of the workforce (salary). </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Is by this notion necessary to understand state, when the producer by delivery of cheap goods tries to withstand in an economic competition by the fact that the competitor&apos;s cost &quot;knocks down&quot; with aim to take away oneself the large part of a market and, thus, increase the own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Either the transfer of production abroad, or the cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance As a result increases, the unemployment in ones in the countries, where, in comparison with other, the cost of the workforce, is is high in the mass scale means it for the businessmen&apos;s majority. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital doesn&apos;t bear any social responsibility, including and behind produced by him unemployment unavoidable expenses of the state for social needs grow. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> On the whole the situation reinforces unwillingness of Messr businessmen to pay taxes and with that *MOST* compensate public economic and social damage, caused them in a chase of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give particular statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unceremonious methods of the private capital create at the level of economies of the separate states of the situation, when the governments of the countries are forced enter a competition with each other to artificially decrease the social level of their population with a view on drawing in to a country of the foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words the governments give back the own population on the tyranny to the private capital notwithstanding social degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> It finds its reflection primarily in the changes of active legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> By aim own appears to economically make ??narod be subordinated to dictation of the private capital primarily in the region of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in a case of prolonged unemployment and in the same time serves as an instrument for cutdown of rights of the employees in a sphere of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result, the level of poverty, and also the difference between the poor and rich increase together from by that. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Public distribution of products over the poor which are not able to support itself by own labour exists already several years in the Federal Republic of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people approaches a million already. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The cases, when the people, placed in a job, earn such a salary that the state must pay to them so that they receive the subsistence minimum permanently happen within the framework of an increase of competitivity of German economy. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The similar scandal has become known to a community also in a case of the additional employees of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economic measures practically in all southern states of EU, surely, in which results to the same state the people, being under the pressure of catastrophic fall of the social status forced or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or exist on the backyards of the society in hope on beggarly salary what ever will come to the country, are private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is however asked from where he will originate? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the capital comes from other countries of EU then poverty to move from one country into other, or he won&apos;t come in general, for a Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work any more for a share of European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> It concerns the whole Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the mass media before nausea assert that the state cannot participate in the capital of own economy that the controllable economy conducts to an economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital steadily insists on the fact that the state must not with actions be mixed up by the managers with economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Is it necessary to answer with a question whether the private capital, now practically the manager don&apos;t act policy and of the themes most the entire state in own selfish aims further? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Unambiguous answer - yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Existence of the practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states is the proof. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As result we have a hopeless situation, being manifested in corruption, the support of reciprocal profits, legislation where practically everything deserves punishment, however isn&apos;t crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In the Federal Republic of Germany the situation is such that the state ministries because of a shortage of financial means entrust the private law firms which tightly are connected with an industry with the development of bills. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The Bundestag afterwards asserts these bills. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The whole power originates not from a people as the constitution of the western type, and from the financial-powerful groups, preferring own interests, says. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the liberally-oriented democracy now quickly turns out in such ??situatsii as this, Appianom in work &quot;the Crisis of the Roman empire in days of Caesar and Pompeii&quot;: &quot;the State disintegrates, already for a long time, and the departments deal with violence is described. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The bribes, illegal reception of mercies with the help of the stones and the swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The bribery and the corruption prospered without the versatile bans, and the people went on an election with the beforehand sold voice&quot;, &quot;the honest people in general didn&apos;t run for the ruler&apos;s job, the state has once eventually remained without a consul &quot;Earnestly, have begun, to speak that that the sole rescue in this awful situation is, autocracy and the necessity of a choice of the energetic person&quot;, Appian thought that it would be Pompeii, but Caesar, who has finally replaced democracy with autocracy has become him, for eight months&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> Own reckless interests without consideration of public interests as also in antiquity, in a modern society prevail. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital already in its essence isn&apos;t intended for an application in public aims. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The present result doesn&apos;t differ from the past: unparalleled degeneration of the elite without any endeavour to conduct reforms of the deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Mean a cause of appearance of fascist, and we must look for the communist regimes in reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> As of today it is possible the absence of these regimes and existence of democracy of liberal type to perceive the definite pause after which the next tour is expected how. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the present elite completely ignores consequences into hundreds of the thousands of victims in the future the humanitarian and social catastrophes which we already now observe together with crimes are against of humaneness, how we know it from old and new history is primarily tragic. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The cancellation of a law of public works isn&apos;t not a solution or at least forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> The government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for the ways for farther decrease in the social level of the population under the pressure of the competition in both international, and of the national and European levels. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> The tendency, by such an image given, has the system character. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Special purpose political and social reforms which will allow strengthening of share participation of the state in economy, the citizens&apos; role in the control of the state will reinforce and will loosen a monopolistic position of the private capital in a society in favour to the state are the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;From violence nothing will be produced, and never Sting, can go - out&quot; song &quot;Fragile&quot; where the main verse of refrain are the words: &quot;we don&apos;t forget how we are fragile&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1295"> Some support Israel substantiating its position with the fact that it has right of self-defence, and the Palestinians come forward in the terrorists&apos; role, other support the Palestinians substantiating it with racism of the Israeli state, genocide, accomplished over the Palestinian Arabs, and a role of the terrorist state is ascribed to the state of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate on one who is in these waves of murders - the criminal, and who, being periodically repeated, the victim, eventually, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, of including the self controllable territories, have been born for a moment of the current political situation, and wasn&apos;t the witnesses have begun violence. </seg>

<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasonings is confirmed with the historical facts, some of them are removed on the base of my own understanding of one, who or what group of the people *BE* the main engine of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of the mankind is primarily the history of struggle for the power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> We can find the same Alexander Velikogo or Napoleon in each epoch. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> That it is not so clear whether whether always these people perfectly independently took their steps, or somebody, who directed their actions to beforehand planned aims stood behind their throne. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> It is necessary to assume that we live in the period, when world wealth is concentrated, and, which this concentration of money and the power, ensuing from them, couldn&apos;t, happen in several persons&apos; arms in life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Some which could be considered as the head of the octopus, (I don&apos;t know, somebody over them, stands, but it isn&apos;t excluded) -, Rothschilds outstands among the astronomically rich families. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> About them isn&apos;t written much. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Is understood. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> They bought the first agency of news (Rejters) already in the 90th years of century, 19, to stop the rumours, connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres, in shadow of which they were, and which always led to consolidation of their power, an increase of wealth or simultaneously and to that, and to other. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> With them the large packages of the shares are almost in all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks they haven&apos;t their share at their disposal, they lead or prepare a war (there were in all 7 countries before the intrusion Afghanistan, 5 countries, have become, remained, however in the same time the Russian government took only four after overthrow of Khaddafi, the central is a bank of their country into their arms after intrusion Iraq). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Any who tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln has refused to keep a status of the central bank behind Rotshil&apos;dovskim Bank of America, during a civil war he has begun to produce own own (understand - governmental) money and was killed in the year 1865 in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy, produce own money and wanted beginnings FED (the federal reserve system) to cancel was killed in 1963 Deputy Louis Makfadden was poisoned in the year 1936 after wanted to give to a court on FED for untying of the Great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for the world power in a period from 1859 to 1871 years has brought to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason of the 33th level by Albert Pajkom. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The, with a task of the first war was destruction monarchic states in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial predominance of especially Great Britain, and the third must bring to reduction of the world population approximately up to 0,5-1 of a billion people (sufficiently the support of their comfort and luxury will be the such number of slaves, and they won&apos;t consume many resources), creation of integral universal religion (the ecumenism cannot be nothing else besides as a prerequisite of such a project) and a final capture of the absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> A challenge of the crisis and subsequent offer of the solutions (order ab chao - the order from chaos) are the method with the help of which the group of the richest families, headed by Rothschilds, works. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are false and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the base FED which had to prevent repetition of a crisis, caused by them, in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they have succeeded in unleashing the First world war by the murder of the Habsburg&apos;s heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo they have destroyed Tsarist Russia beginning bolshevik revolyutsiiyu. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war has ended with abrupt, unfounded in military and economic relation by the capitulation of Germany (the necessity of a war for destruction of Tsarist Russia hasn&apos;t already been), breaking up with the central European state, Austro-Hungary, as consequence, has also happened. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For relief of untying of the Second world war the bankers and the politicians have created a concealed uncooperative situation putting huge military reparations what to Germany, has been created a prerequisite of radicalization of masses, then, further, to create multinational Czechoslovakia with by strong German minority, which is have to was to play, and have indeed played a function of the fifth column, in kindling of a fire of war remained only toss up the Germans sufficiently having got poor strong, the convicting of culpable and proposing the Leader&apos;s simple decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds provoked a base for Zionist movement, of which one branch strove, to create the Jewish state, is preferable is in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned declaration of Balfour has created a prerequisite of the Jews&apos; mass immigration to Palestine, the first collisions with the local Arab population have begun to happen. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks happened from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second world war has flashed, it is difficult to estimate whether Hitler has escaped from the chains, in which primordially the bankers, kept him, or everything, that it has done, was planned in any case of suffering of the European Jews in the concentrative camps have been created the prerequisites of recognition of the Jewish state as the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially based in 1948 and, like that as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2th world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create focus of third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers succeed in untying her, the Jewish people, as also in the second world war will become a victim of the military operations on a line of the front, now already together with the Arab or, more simply speaking by the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is the like gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside a country, but at the international level (take only sharp separation of the people into the partisans and the opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty, and who is a victim in a Palestinian-Israeli conflict where the resentment causes resentment in an infinite chain of violence if everything has begun with the individuals&apos; greed and their aspiration the world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It here is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because the bankers, as also at us international, fob off for the people for a voting in the election of only the own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The present prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal to the international bankers, the politician, making everything to start the war with Iran which due to membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) will threaten to develop into the world conflict, and taking the control of Iran of the *Hormuz* strait, containing 20 % of all world reserves of petroleum (the navigable corridor is only only 2 miles by the width) -, into account also will result in destruction of world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light the words, said by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;what is All for us necessary - it is a common crisis, and the people will receive the new world order&quot; are now manifested. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in their idea is a world of the gentlemen and the slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The world where the remaining part of the human population serves the handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Consecration oil where the chip with which it becomes essence, being under the total control, is implanted for each born body in birth. </seg>

<seg id="1335"> A film &quot;the Operation &quot;by Slang&quot;: When worse ????? where call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 the crowd of islamistic students-demonstrators captured the embassy of the USA in Teheran and has taken into 52 diplomats&apos; hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They had to be released in exchange for overthrown shah Mohammed Rezy *Pehlevi* that was running after a revolution in the USA which were a patron of his regime during the decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the administration of the USA positive outcome of the situation wasn&apos;t supposed - she couldn&apos;t allow itself to throw out a shah behind a board, because in root it could shatter confidence of the allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However to reach a release of the hostages in Iran where the revolution has resulted in an establishment of a theocratic regime she was not able. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow at the prestige of the United States which later was reinforced with futile attempt to release the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captive diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations in mediation of the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their destiny has caused a wave of solidarity and anti Iranian moods at home. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The lesion in Iran to a significant extent contributed to a defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of the 1980th year that has finished in the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> By actor Ben Afflekom &quot;the Operation &quot;of Slang&quot; describes one of the episodes of that history which has brought America the small victories the film, srezhessirovannyj. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Six employees have shortly before an occupation of an embassy succeeded in running down. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated peripeteias they have finished their way to residences of the embassy of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities has succeeded in taking them away from Iran, in this case has helped the extravagant legend of the cover according to which they have departed with the Canadian passports as the members of a shooting group that were looking about for a place for shooting of science fiction epic in a country. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of the genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan which an expert &quot;on evacuation&quot; of Tony Mendes has invented required cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So that the legend is certain, in the specialized magazines was written about the project of a film the press conferences were convened, the fictitious productional company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details on an operation stuck the long time in a secret, the film, based is on memoirs of Tony Mendesa. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleka film is special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> An on the one hand real political thriller, the so named &quot;film-cine opus&quot;, the history of successful contrivance, fraud - the row of the films about friends Oushena can be the example. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In a film permanently vary moods - on the one hand documentary, the conceived scenes from Teheran (in the titles are the sign historical photographs of the events and that in what way the same situations were demonstrated in a film - of considerable differences in it isn&apos;t indicative). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> The Hollywood excerpts, on the other hand facilitated, intersecting irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And afterwards else a scene from the headquarters of CIA and other institutions - the men in the suits discuss a situation behind the tables of negotiations, on the ladders of the institutions, by a telephone </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleku has remarkably succeeded in making the re take-off of career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a ridiculed actor have become a respectful director, also his game has stopped being an object of mockeries. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;An operation &quot;of Slang&quot; its third full-length film after dark detective story &quot;Farewell the my own darling, farewell&quot; (2007) and a thriller &quot;City&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> In the same time it is the Affleka first film which isn&apos;t shot in the native city of the director - Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The emotion of the atmosphere of place in this case relates to the qualities which elevated the earlier films of the director over Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Afflek reveals it in &quot;Slang&quot; where Canada &quot;plays&quot; Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes happen in a film in the streets, in a reconstruction of the real events - the entrance scenes of fall impress the embassies on their clarity which also conveys emotions of the confusion and unforeseenness which arises, when somewhere suddenly the history changes. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Afflek similar effect and it the colleagues reach in the fictitious scenes (the false headquarters on Teheran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The processes in too many places are too much. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to have an affair with the fact that the narration doesn&apos;t suppose a set of the exciting scenes of the cinematographic value. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He enough successfully works with these few things, thinks - something through occasionally there all of it goes out not so elegantly (the scene in which telephone call in America prevents an approaching crisis in an airport of Teheran, and the chase on a runway look enough far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Dispersion, connected with the necessity to show too many events in too many places, is the shortage &quot;of Slang&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the Hollywood colleagues&apos; role are indeed very charming, however their characters would deserve *greater* space, and they are in a film far not the sole. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Affleka film is in short supply a little *dramatic_effect* watch the film of which possible with moderate interest estimating production and retro-style re-creating it, the thrillers of the seventieth. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But capture with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However it is sufficiently reminder about one, still in the known sense of living story, as well as for an evidence of that as exaggerated idea of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules of inflation of the balloons, the bananas and a circus </seg>

<seg id="1376"> There is a recent decision of the European court on a union with a stake of insurance payments for the men and the women among the absurdities, put forward nomination already. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Hitherto the women had benefits to insurance of life, because for the insurance companies they objectively are less subject to risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;The people can get farther incredible ideas from a workshop of EU from a competition before the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The voting itself will take place before the end of February 2013&quot; -, Nager has said. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> To the questionable orders of EU relates, for example also obligatory addition of bio components into fuel, which, as a result, causes harm to nature, as well as a ban on use of the reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain, the relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the directive size are the cages for the hens, due to which in this year the eggs have considerably risen in price. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> A factual ban on use of a term &quot;sandwich oil&quot; or a withdrawal from a sale of the classical bulbs has been subject also to the criticism. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The quality bananas must be the length of 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The all-Europe apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of that or different the trading or industrial lobbies the positions of which in Brussels are usually protected with any state or a group of the states (Czechia now even under threat veta advocates the requirements of their banks with such an image). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Interests of the lobby are such:, for example the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to have the length of 14 centimetres and didn&apos;t dare to reveal &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> In this case the European Commission was justified with the fact that only harmonize the existing scattered national rules which complicated trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> EU notwithstanding the resistance of some states has nevertheless softened standards, touching the fruits and the vegetables refering to the fact that existing directives will result in *squandering*/dissipation of products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate on gain in a polling can become also the last year&apos;s decree of the EU, agrees the air balls, to which selling themselves, necessarily must supply with a warning about the fact that the children are more junior than eight years they cannot be inflated without the adults&apos; care. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> EU has appealed to the American investigations in accordance with which the air balls in a game are a potential cause of the children&apos;s death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The similar restriction now spreads on the children before 14 years to which it is forbidden to blow into fair dudelki. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Amusing ideas are born also at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Sufficiently absurd is and governed, touched the European officials: each who has any official job in EU, cannot taking delicacy of the theme for Greece into account use the name of Macedonia, but have to instead of it say &quot;BYURM&quot; (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The portal Bankovnipoplatky.com in cooperation with a union with the liberal economists has proposed &quot;the Principle of non-intervention&quot; (Laissez Faire) for a voting, the absurd rules, besides several higher stated, for example, the rule of EU about the volume of the food reserves in the territory of the membership state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> EU has set the maximum volume of the reserves of food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic for a day of its entry to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Czechia has hereafter exceeded, for example the set volumes of the canned mushrooms, for which her the heavy fine threatened. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of questionnaire has also attracted also the idea to pay to some countries for that, that they haven&apos;t a sea, is also the idea of allocation of the grants for a declaration of reception of the grants. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague, and not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We hold a disadvantageous position, because we haven&apos;t a sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We shall ask the European Union about compensation&quot;, - the then minister of agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CHSDP) declared 2004 years in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As argument, he has indicated that there was bountiful crop of a grain in the country, also as a result of the so named interventional purchases, the state had the full magazines of the reserves it was necessary to take which away. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the fact that Czechia is far from the ports, EU, according to a Palas had to pay hundreds of millions of euros to us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In a total the European commission has gone to meet the Czech Republic organizing tender of a purchase of a grain from the countries which haven&apos;t an exit to a sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The grants for reception of the grant has proposed to the villages the Ministry of regional development, led by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU) in particular such grants had to go from Brussels on compilation of a declaration on the grant. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: the Fancy orders are exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the decrees in the states-members easily become an object of criticism, the effort of EU in adjustment, as well as more effectively functioning and the development of the European Union confessions in many experts&apos; opinion deserve rather. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Scooping of the grants from EU for the projects which haven&apos;t even the hint at anything common to a recess of European integration, which the states-members have however attained in discussion of a budget in the experts&apos; opinion is the serious problem. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Cause emotions among the Czechs and the fact that the Republic, as also in other countries of the European Union Czech, must struggle in Brussels for right of specific identification of its traditional products, and not always it wins in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of battles with the Germans and the Austrians have kept a name &quot;the Olomoutskie cheese curds&quot;, however &quot;Tuzemskij the rum&quot; traditions of which in our country go away with roots in a century, 19, our producers are have to, was to rename on &quot;Tuzemak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products from cane distillate, and not from the sugar beetroot can be called rum. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr senator, how to run for the president&apos;s office comes for the person to the head? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think about the fact to become oneself a senator or the president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If with us in a country everything functioned without the problems then I anywhere wouldn&apos;t run. </seg>

<seg id="1421"> I said all the time that I would join to struggle for a presidential lock of depending on result of the election to a Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> I have later precised that I if I am chosen by the senator then shall run for the presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My aim isn&apos;t job, the job is the instrument with the help of which I can realize its glances. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The greatest influence and the widest authorities therefore are for me necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But difficulty not only in the fact that we as a nation repine with us in a bar or at the TV set, but in this case is ready to trample any who will try to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The mass media which denigrate the person, and which confound freedom of speech with freedom of lie add to it. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It was told that I gave the bribes to the journalists, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka me, for example about. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We shall pass to your glances. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> For a presidential lock you have started with the theses on material and criminal responsibility of the politicians and the reverse property declarations to sum above twenty million struggle. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> It is to realize it necessary to change a law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You, as the president, haven&apos;t such authorities, and only the entire senate can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this task? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I, as a citizen, lobbied the fact that the execution of excursions has become a free enterprise it has proved possible to advance it. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem consists in intrigue - when somebody comes with good offer on left or on right, obstacles, are deliberately raised for him, and it restrains the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent nonpartisan person, I have the much *greater* potential for reception of a support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I without party-spreading out over the shelves, without looking back at doctrines can take my advantage that me what appears best for our country also to use that, it from each party. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you believe yourself the person, more relating to right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> It seems that the people class me sooner among left from a Czech viewpoint to me. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A little to the left or a little to the right are in general not important for me. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> It is important for me that we walked ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> The matter concerns not about what somebody relates to right, and, somebody, to left, I want to combine the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always shall support any decision whether will propose him KPCHM or GDP, good for a society, and I exactly as shall be against bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry when somebody says that you are a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But don&apos;t you prove it by the fact that you have said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create business-plan for a company you also have some ideal aims and glances. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try to approach it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> It is possible to name it populism, but about which I say all offers, already functions in the world, or the eminent experts speak them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But only the slogans will remain without your support of the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with it you long won&apos;t hold out in a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you will go out to the people and will you speak them then you will succeed in realizing criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I haven&apos;t the other possibility. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only to convince the politicians, the journalists and a community and try to lure them away on their side, so that we attain own. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected to president then wouldn&apos;t make up a problem, to organize TV live broadcast, in which I shall appeal to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with appeal to legitimate material and criminal is responsibility for the politicians of the state the serving, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they in a case of a refusal will be have to report why it isn&apos;t wanted. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If the strong personality which will vocalize abuses is then it will be possible to exercise the pressure on a political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president - it was merit of the pressure of the community. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say directly that I am an amateur, and is not a genius and is not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for the allies to advocate my convictions and glances. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I only beginning am in a politician, and I for my programme shall try to find a support of majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try to advance the affairs independently; I in that case if it doesn&apos;t prove, possible shall finish in six years and I shall return to a private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It partly sounds so, like Okamura must salvage Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not no saviour. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that alone I shan&apos;t do anything, I have therefore bypassed a number of known people with offer to run to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have gone to Radimu Yanchure, he has refused in connection with the large volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also I have at least supported journalist Yana Lorentsovu which has disclosed fraud with light fuel oil products conducting investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I have put forward my candidacy because the people also really are non satisfied, but now I feel myself on the weights. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people haven&apos;t gone on an election, and the majority of ones who have gone, the representatives of an establishment have been chosen. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We independent only two are in a Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen a Senate so that changes will come true with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Notwithstanding it I shall struggle for my glances, for example for the direct election of the mayors and the governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about a base for an own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The about it me yet not thought, because at there is no me time of the fact to check the purity of past each potential partisan, and I am not at on it of money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money also on a presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent bill. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Haven&apos;t you money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Do you speak the property declarations, and how are your own affairs with it? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The personal property is estimated approximately at 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> With me well also several more million in an account are, the area is in Prague of the cost of about 25 million, the apartment on 10 million, one more apartment on 8 million, collection of products of art approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin on 3,5 million and Skoda Superb on a million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> To the purpose Aston-Martin has appeared at me because it was my boyish dream - me always pleased Dzhejms Bond who rode a machine, was gallant with the women and in the same time struggled against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Do you do Aston-ride on Martin, do you possess a property on 60 million and at you, is there no money on a campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the republic, but you specially don&apos;t want in it to invest own money. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very persuasive. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I haven&apos;t 15 millions on a campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Must I fall in debts? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have inserted in a campaign already 2,5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> It is that fact that I haven&apos;t the sponsors, testifies to the fact that my programme is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I must not pay for the election campaign from my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Senatorial salary will cover expenses for a campaign over of essence to me. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But on this money I wouldn&apos;t live, for example, couldn&apos;t pay to a son for the English school which costs 30 thousand monthly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted only to make money so anywhere wouldn&apos;t run. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Then further will you deal with an enterprise, so that it is possible to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you really say that you would reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it doesn&apos;t depend on the size of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I also promised, I have partially reduced my activity. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> My deputy in spring will become, for example manager director of the tourist agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people would want, which which I was bessrebrennikom, will store, the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But it is for me too necessary on something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much have as a businessman you got accustomed to receive monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> What I also further from two hundred to four hundred thousand receive. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I have become a president, then would finish one&apos;s enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find the full interview in the Saturday production of a newspaper &quot;Right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in imagination - on example Spejkenisse and he of the recently built Book mountain - 2 photographs </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristichno, it finally with us again is possible to see something interesting -, Lizette Verkhajg speaks, the passer-by is on an edge of the road to me&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stephen Spermon, the specialist in IT on a situated nearby large enterprise, believes so: &quot;No this building is indeed beautiful&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But do I ask myself: what we need one more library today for? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everybody has the Internet, the iPad and the electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Does already nobody now voluntarily go to such oldfashioned libraries probably? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> An unusual record belongs to the sleeping small town near Rotterdam, Spejkenisse-small notable. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population quantity his 80.000 people have the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> For struggle with this vexatious circumstance it several years ago was decided to make a contribution to common formation and build seven fictitious bridges which are depicted on the banknotes of the euro, as the pictorially coloured miniatures from ferroconcrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success in this enlightening initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the fathers of the city understood that in them had remained the sole possibility to overcome statistics: build a library here! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Accuse Maas from the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, the expert on the brave *STOLBCHATYJ* diagrams and the author of even the witty, occasionally cynical constructions, have treated a task with their common imperturbation and have appeared on competitively listening in the year 2003 with five books under a mouse and grin on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And as long as the members of a jury puzzledly looked around and *SHRUG1* of the shoulders, impudent Maas has made up a pyramid in size for their original gift and has completed speech in defense of their project the next words: &quot;about the Respectful townspeople&quot;! </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It, my offer: here are &quot;the Book mountain&quot; is in Spejkenisse so named Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> After nine years this mountain of the cost of 30 million of a euro has grown. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> She is the part of the project revitalizatsii which includes also an underground garage, the supermarket, the dwelling houses and taunkhausov altogether on 50 apartments adjoining them will esteem also several. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November &quot;the Book mountain&quot; was noted the second prize of the competition &quot;the Best library of the Netherlands of 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Also the project provides a national Dutch competition in the wooden buildings 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In such a way the faceless suburb which before couldn&apos;t propose anything except a postmodernistic pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall of which the white facades are led to the idea of a dairy has become richer in one modern work of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But most important - into Spejkenisse has appeared a public building of cultural destination is the first in the history of this small town. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> A long road to a book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: book *EL&apos;DORADO* is under a hood for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Only one lift, going at the center of mountain range, for the real admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this locality on foot, is here. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The glazed from all sides the room is light and easily is comprehensible floors from a burned brick also the elegant street lanterns unerringly create a feeling of the public urban area. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban medium is re-created ideally. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Involuntarily look for glance the benches, the boys and the girls, also playing the dogs in football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And the books, the books, the books are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;The usually book regiments stand along the facades, and in middle is a large dark hall as a rule, comfortless and faceless&quot;, - speaks Accuse Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have placed classical configuration of space from the legs on the head and have extracted a zone for reading from within outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Internal space of the book mountain is used skilfully: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the ecological center and the technical rooms are at the center. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> The black book regiments which serve as a sometimes decoration of the walls, and sometimes the parapets, and sometimes the staircase railings especially please. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their kind, texture and smell are unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the sophisticated architects and engineers-builders get lost in guesses what unknown material it is. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We strove work with the secondary materials&quot; -, Jop Trauborst explains, the leader of the project, presenting a community of Spejkenisse in accordance with the requirements of standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And somehow since we have met suitable collateral product of agriculture on one agrarian enterprise into Frislandii. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The years in the greenhouses, and to the fields in the Netherlands, as a lining, under roots applies the artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness are already much. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Cheaply also it economizes the time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textile serves a one-two season, after it to throw him out is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For a library this linen - for the first time in such volumes - was compacted in a panel of thickness four centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under effect of fever and pressure so named landbauplastik (KLP) converts into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, there is a a little reminding new automobile and a little are the gym-shoes over the smell. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> 105 steps lead to apex. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> A one who will overcome way of the length of almost 500 metres, will be rewarded in a literary cafe with not only a fantastic view on the city, but also Dutch croquets and the woody ficuses in the pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They take care about an atmosphere, also primarily correct the humidity of air on a literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Expenditure for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is difficult to come to believe, but this building, notwithstanding a set of the glass surfaces, is the exemplary project the plan of ecology&quot; -, Trouborst speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Heat of ground is used for its heating and refrigeration. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the Book mountain stands under the glass hood even in clear days the sun gets inside only *FOR1* a short time. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The wide farms from glued wood, situated perpendicularly to the glass facade, give shadow and admit the large part of the solar rays on themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Climate in a room is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The automatic roll curtains insure remaining protection completely. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stephen Spermon, the mentioned higher skeptic from a sphere of IT has already visited a new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lizette Verkhajg has also already been here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine *Cynthis* Bogard who has named Bukenberg &quot;the Spejkenisse soul enough which there wasn&apos;t for a long time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A cause: in several weeks before a discovery each inhabitant received invitation to bestow one book from an own meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books had to occupy the empty places on the shelves of the library - not completely staffed 70.000 books were for that moment in it yet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea has worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The regiments are made completely. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;Nothing worse than a half empty library - has been&quot; an architect speaks if Maas had Accused. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that due to our invitation now each inhabitant in some way is connected with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Each knows that its book is the part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if she serves only for a decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> It thus, MVRDV has proved possible to solve the royal task which on professional slang is called creation of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spejkenisse has written the literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And although they are very young and are uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is however only the origin for a construction of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> A sabot: &quot;the Germans must play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in a voting about confession of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> In opinion of Stephen Sabo, the expert on the connections between the USA and Europe acting so Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany at first allowed understand that she will vote against an application of the Palestinians of reception of a status of an observer at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained in a voting. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Sabo: Germany doesn&apos;t support action of the Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> It is now for Germany necessary to be cautious in connection with its special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But simultaneously I believe that it also doesn&apos;t support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - at it not appearing too critically Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany has also abstained in a voting about introduction of a forbidden zone for the flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the total of NATO have conducted this offer. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Does Germany find it difficult to hold a distinct position in the complicated international questions? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is so. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The matter is that it is in a process of conversion of its foreign policy, namely passes from policy of which so to say the USA were controlled to properly German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is additionally complicated with the fact that coordinated integral policy is absent at the Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus the Germans again turn out between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they to it haven&apos;t got accustomed from them. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only fumble with my role, but is on a way to &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy which France or Great Britain conduct. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does the &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from a German viewpoint specifically mean? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is readiness to hold a position, not depending on a position of the USA or the European partners, in its national interests. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy i.e. from export and the connections with the definite regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Economic interests of Germany to a significant extent differ from interests of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Have influenced these economic interests on a position in the Middle East conflict and on a voting in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First Germany has the large markets of a sale in the Middle East in particular in the states of the Persian gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> It therefore is for her necessary to show caution not to insult a community and the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case it plays its role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I wouldn&apos;t attach too great importance to it, it is not a completely unilateral connection. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in calculations of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Has Germany harmed to its relations with the USA abstaining in making of the important decisions, such as a voting about Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even to the USA prevails understanding of a German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore I don&apos;t think that it was the same dramatic fracture as in a Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany will even acquire respect, by such an image defined. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> However it signals the fact that it is necessary to perceive her earnestly as a player on international arena and that behoves to reckon with its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Different opinions about a Palestinian initiative exist in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The USA have conversely distinctly spoken out for veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disagreement between opinions between the USA and many European states? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Owing to American inner policy such differences existed always. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government of Obama in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with a local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that essential disagreements in opinions are quite not so significant, as always seems. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> You if you consider relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu then will notice that Obama is quite not in admiration for Netanyahu&apos;s policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does Germany find it easy to combine its close connections with Israel and the USA on the one hand and a position of the most important partner in EU from other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think just it makes a situation of such difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would find it somewhat simpler if integral, non-contradictory European policy, existed, but now it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore they cannot appear within the framework of wider approach and is forced instead of it act leaning against only the own vision of a situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Just so they treat a euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the production of a common European position on *MYSELF*. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is understandable that for Germany it is not simple at least because of the connections with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This theme always was ticklish. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself in a role of an important international player - won&apos;t she take the indeed main role on herself? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is else heavily still the leading role given to Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany hasn&apos;t got accustomed to it yet, to play a significant role hitherto and, for the obvious causes, hitherto always heavily yields is always disagreeable for her. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We shall view, for example, when the crisis of the euro is each time Germany takes an important role on ourselves, most different anti German emotions are manifested. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans must not just cope with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Properly speaking, it is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded with the hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this viewpoint Germany holds a significantly heavier position than the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> She must take into account of the most different neighbours and opinion, and it is not simple. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Does influence of the USA in European policy thus permanently weaken, but at a given moment of EU don&apos;t fill in this vacuum, who then remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans just will have to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if it doesn&apos;t please you, it is disagreeable or reinforces your - dislike the life is such! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Sabo is a deputy of the director of the Transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute in which the academicians and the experts-the political scientists from Europe and the North America jointly investigate the problems of a transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Besides that the Sabot is a member of the German fund of Marshall in whom he specializes in German policy, foreign policy of the USA and the transatlantic connections. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;The protection of the goods signs&quot; is in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly will become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani - worldwide known trademark Polo Ralph Lauren - too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo such? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> This name which hasn&apos;t anything common to the companies from the names of which it is formed, perfectly officially registered in China. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> It will be nevertheless guarded, until the owners of the initial names file for a suit. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But it is then unclear whether it will prove possible with him to advocate the rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;The foreigners find it still more difficult to protect their goods signs in China&quot; - the, Thomas Pattlokh speaks, lawyer of a company of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of rights of the goods signs in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my table by each week appear in a new affair of such a kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> For the imitators sufficiently to add in all a couple of letters to acquire right to register one&apos;s trading signs. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci turns out Lu-Gucci, it instead of Prada is possible to register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The German enterprises, for example, the producer of sports goods of Puma are legally copied by the same mode. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattlokh opens a folder with the recordings of the department of a registration of the goods signs in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010 the Chinese company registered trading sign Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name for which also the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna is used there. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world in copying and violation of rights of an intellectual property, known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> There in the large cities are multistorey department stores, selling almost only the counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Which the opposes fact that the Chinese enterprises perfectly officially acquired a he however is Pattlokha affairs not such On assignment of his principals right to use name is narrower is guarded somewhere else from the department of a registration of the goods signs. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese name it &quot;ban a share, the mark-passenger are the ministry&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word associates itself &quot;with ban dakuan&apos;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The women who hunt for the rich men are so named. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities don&apos;t recognize guilt behind them </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It causes damage to business, to struggle, - with it is necessary&quot;, Pattlokh is convinced. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The trademark diffuses, the unique position gets lost, the image very strongly suffers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and judicial expenses in branches that have suffered are calculated with millions especially in a case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data of the company of investigations to market CLSA China with the volume of the sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third in size and most quickly growing market of a sale of the items of luxury. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> To attain removal of the doubtful recordings in register of the trading signs is however difficult, and it costs dearly. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattlokh tells about the affairs, into which the court rejected the suits, for upon expiration of the long time the contested name has become &quot;reality of market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff hasn&apos;t luck then he will even have to pay to a plagiarist, for have caused damage to its trading sign in China, Pattlokh speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Occasionally here the law of the jungles corrects. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There are also famous cases of the graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 the company of Daimler lost judicial argument with a producer of construction machines Sany, the enterprise which has shortly before that acquired a company-producer of concrete-pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore the Chinese hitherto have right to use emblem, similar to a star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The company of Geely that has bought Volvo initially used a blue-white logotype, a process is BMW; that was reminding, Geely was successful, one has had to change him. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste has lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore at which the famous crocodile saw the other side. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities don&apos;t believe themselves guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The department of a registration of the goods signs CTMO in Beijing confirms that in the year 2010 because of a shortage of the personnel and the equipment of the rooms there had a place of difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the last year &quot;the return from emergency in a working process to norm&quot; happened. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So the number of crude affairs over objections has diminished by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57.000 such affairs were closed 75 percent more than in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Productions in a department nevertheless still else expect 81.500 complaints. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It dearly is worth struggling with it </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As very frequent in China figures impress. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the last year in CTMO more than 1,4 million declarations of the protection of the trading signs entered almost the third more than into 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It also means, which China for the tenth time in succession has headed, the record, a department reports the list of the new registrations in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same concerns the common number of actual trading signs, in all 5,5 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 1,8 billion yuans of collections were paid off. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If simplify it means that each registration stands on the average in 1280 yuans or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> It is worth contesting many times more her as an affair of the German family enterprise of Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Over a distance of more than seven years the concern struggles against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have succeeded in attaining the fact that the illegal production by him of the false automobile details was liquidated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The imitator has however allotted Chinese rights of trading sign Freudenberg for himself. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was an own omission, for the last names in Germany must not is *PROTECTION*, Khanno Venttsler speaks, the head of the board of administration Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the department of a registration of the trading signs CTMO has rejected a complaint myunkhentsev. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> True in the both next instances Freudenberg has won, but the opposite side continues struggle hitherto. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It is necessary to it be on the alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the question is on consideration in the Supreme court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttsler hopes to bring up an affair to good termination and praises professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;the Process is exceedingly expensive and takes away much time, money and the nerves from us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal expenditures hardly yield to a registration, the archive of the company, one has had to view even the acts of a centennial prescription to give the proofs. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg without results proposed &quot;large six digit sum of a euro&quot; for settlement to an opposite side. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It hence is clear how dearly it costs - us&quot;, Venttsler speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Dangers of the Far East threaten to bandy even to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Namely the in that case if imitators will register the unprotected trading signs there behind them. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name of Freudenberg for the footwear and products of the skin. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The concern has long ago stopped production in these regions, but notwithstanding it could prevent a registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is necessary to it be on - the alert&quot;, Venttsler speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he, and lawyer Pattlokh recommend to the German enterprises to be very cautious of China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is insufficient to rely upon the international theses on the protection of the goods signs rather the foreigners, it follows, Venttsler speaks, &quot;that in any way it is worth protecting everything, register also in China&quot; -. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can manage much dearer than a registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> It is actual: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of a trading sign, then to pay license collections to an opposite side for an own name, will be have to, Venttsler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> We shall be otherwise forced out from a market in a questionable segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of AIDS: pritoptyvat&apos; to sing help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Into Khajdel&apos;berge the chorus of Imbongi - and the in Swaziland orphans of AIDS is glad about it rehearse. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The history of relations that have overcome the distance more than 8733 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> At first sounds heeling: the cowboy high boots, the basketball gym-shoes, the lady boats and the male slippers pick up the time on the parquet floor and quickly find him. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The time-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only after it the voices of the singers - the viola, the bass, the tenor and a soprano - they advance, charm and follow each other slowly grow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Khopf, and *phita* a 29 year-old conductor, almost bounce out of one&apos;s cloth shoes, when lead them with flexible and expressive gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> An evening of Monday, the in a musical hall institute of medical, psychology in Khajdel&apos;berge the chorus of Imbongi rehearses new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty participants of a chorus from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in genetics of a person to a janitor have come on rehearsal. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Ohm&quot; Obani&quot; - not simple thing, each voice of the chorus has its text besides, in the perfectly alien language: which the, *Zulu*, eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique speak and in some parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help is for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to the grade of Unaids of the programme of the United Nations of struggle with AIDS about 34 million HIV-infected in the world exist. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23,5 million from them live in the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland 000 orphans of AIDS live in 245. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In this case more than 40 percent of the population by HIV-are positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village Esitzheni union Voices for Africa has found the chiefs in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them visit a school, preparing for a farther instruction. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per month it is possible to take patronage on oneself. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees money on the center to a child the school, Gogh&apos;s-school uniform and, daily hot lunch in. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi in a *Zulu* language means a narrator or voskhvalitel&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this hall isn&apos;t told fluently, on for the bow on the other hand is *CAN1* to sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> The chorus learns almost ten years songs in this alien soft language and from time to time even brings them again there where they for the first time have appeared: to the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> The village Esitzheni which depends on the voices of the German chorus is however at the distance of 8733 kilometres of summer from Khajdel&apos;berga, in the north-west of the kingdom Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> There about 2000 people some hitherto in the simple huts from clay and a straw, there are many children among the inhabitants are lived. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have remained without the parents who have died from a virus ICH. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Into Esitzheni in a miniature is reflected the disease of the whole Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the expected duration of life according to data of UNICEF, lowest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Cutting of the extreme flesh have the men which dokazanno decreases risk of infection half, among the population, it isn&apos;t almost accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry a virus of immunodeficiency in oneself, the death is on the middle of the fourth ten - not the rarity. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The chorus has opened this village in a joint journey Africa in spring of 2005, but before, participants Imbogni have seen a set of the children in the streets for which there weren&apos;t enough not only parental care, but just everything: food, the clothes of education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> No chances without school formation with a person are in a poor country in general. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was private obligation of the individual participants - for several euros per year send a child to a school and grant a possibility of times per day to it to receive hot food. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But after already a year the chorus has based the union &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; which since then almost professionally takes care about the orphans of AIDS into Esitzheni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The facts of about infections conveyed by the sexual way </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important diseases, conveyed by the sexual way? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Syphilis, khlamidioz and a gonorrhoea (the gonorrhoea) is classed among bacterial IPPP. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Viral IPPP are frequent, HIV, the human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The pubic pediculosis and the scabies relate to parasitic IPPP. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the basic struck groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and the gonorrhoea occur in the main thing at the men which make love for the men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The institute of Robert Koch proceeds from the fact that the minimum of four of each five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, the transfer happens as a result of sexual contacts between the men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> khlamidijnye of infection, trikhomoniaz, kandidoz (the fungus) the gonorrhoea and the human papilloma-virus are the ones that at the heterosexual adult people often occur with the diseases, conveyed by the sexual way. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The dissemination of HIV among the heterosexual adults with us is comparatively low - however about 20 percent of new infections of HIV fall on this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> One occurs among the youth khlamidijnye infection considerably more often than among other groups of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European data, three quarters of all infections strike the young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The human papilloma-virus with us often occurs also among the youth. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How does the number of infection cases change? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all diseases, conveyed by the sexual way, must the obligatory is *REGISTRATION*. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The sickness rate of syphilis according to data of the Institute of Robert Koch more than has doubled from 1697 cases in the year 2001 before 3698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new infections of HIV since 2007 goes down. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> About 2700 cases were in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is the about one tenth less than in a previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms point a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Ulcers in the region of the genitals, the complaint in urination, allocation, pain below the belly, as well as the bubbles or the seals can arise in the infectious diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> They aren&apos;t often however accompanied by pains and other symptoms and remain unobserved. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How is it possible to defend oneself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> The condoms are capable of reducing risk of infection, but don&apos;t give hundred-percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> However partially the exciters of the diseases, conveyed by the sexual way, can be spread also by contact infection and at close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore the experts recommend a regular checkup especially in frequent replacement of the sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> In early diagnostic it is possible to cure the majority IPPP and avoid remote consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> The patronage, donations and the not into last queue the fees for performances of the chorus over the whole Germany allow assembling of something. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all we have sent into Esitzheni already near 200 to 000 euros&quot;, Annete Lennartts speaks, the chairman of a union. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Tsodva conscious Dlamini, and an active woman in the village itself manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She takes care also the about fact that the orphans will be well made, for example at one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Gogos how names the old women on *Zulu*, it is a support of a village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have admitted up to 14 orphans to oneself, give a roof over the head to them and take care about the fact that the children in a form each day in time appear on the lessons. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Ones in whom the relatives haven&apos;t remained enter the shelter to Khanijsile who earning salary from a unification as also two cooks prepare for the lonely woman each day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Besides that union &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has organized the sewing school, has built two hencoops and has jointly with an American organization for the protection of the health PSI organized surrender of analysis on HIV for many inhabitants of a village. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It is difficult to present, but about the disease which is so obvious in the whole country, prefers deeply to be silent. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The king and 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> Annete Lennartts - says &quot;because he is connected with sexuality&quot; &quot;AIDS is absolute taboo&quot; -. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> In which enough unusually a country the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Msvati are III famous for their love for excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> The polygamy is instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Guilt of the fact that the virus ICH so quickly spread in the last years also falls on such a style, authorized by the state, of life in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But she lies also on the roving workers who deliver a virus to a country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> The free condoms are literally at each corner, Annete Lennartts speaks, &quot;but almost don&apos;t use them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The other culture is flesh to flesh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To a little support cultural exchange chorus Ibmogni of each two-three years makes a journey the south of Africa and sings songs, full of melancholy, the battle spirit, the certainty and black apperception which are many on the southern edge of the black continent know since times of apartheid yet. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus, full of white which sing songs is in a black language - such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, called of a tear on the eyes of the stern border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey always leads also into Esitzheni, where the singers visit the sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Notwithstanding the fact that it is possible to find the small village with difficulty on a kart in a valley of the river Etsulveni she is more than known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Walk into Esitzheni, light - is there&quot;, the local people speak. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after the 8733-kilometre flight back into Khajdel&apos;berg, it when the stamping singers return to the rehearsal hall in street Bergkhajmer, is possible to see that this light burns also here. </seg>

<seg id="1794"> Nobody connects opening of ice with existence of life on a planet, the scientific leader of a probe Sean Solomon has said. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can be the 426 degrees of Celsius. </seg>

<seg id="1882"> It is possible to name the journey across the *TALYSHSKIJ* mountains wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minibus with clatter rolls over a winding road by the hills, the stormy small rivers and the simple peasant houses that have overgrown the thick forests. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything round is so green and it is bright that it is possible to think you like are in *Sshwarzwald*. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only in several kilometres hence. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> *TALYSh* - one of the peoples of the Caucasus of which known a little only really the fact that they beautifully speak farsi and azerbajzhdanskom and differ in longevity is live here. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Lerik is the destination point. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small small town boasts about the too heavy architecture of Soviet times which doesn&apos;t match the picturesque mountain landscape at all. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The tourists almost don&apos;t come from Europe here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tedious. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Eight hours go away for the road has in all one band on 323 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The legendary wealth which owes a country petroleum of the Caspian sea, here, to a province so far hasn&apos;t got. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However convinced that in Lerike eat Pilate Fatulaeva (48) by what attract the tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In May Baku became famous for festival of song Eurovision - and festival of the oldest people of the world - at us will take place in the next year&quot;, Fatulaeva speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is a director of a museum of longevity, probably sole in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here the biography of about eight dozens of *TALYSh* from these places which more than are 100 years of Fatulaeva old point black-and-white photography is documented. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> It is my grandfather, he is here 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years one more child to it was born </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who has allegedly accomplished 168 years is the questionable star of the museum. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is no evidence of birth however. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And considering the fact that whose age is confirmed the documents, have accomplished 122 years for the oldest person, Myuslyumova age seems exceedingly doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in this district in 1805, died in 1973&quot; -, Fatulaeva explains. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years the daughter to it allegedly was born. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has so shepherd Myuslyumov added a couple of tens of years to his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However even Rembrandt Shol&apos;ts, the researcher of age from the Institute of Max Planck in Rostock heard of the long-lived persons in the Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Many people, &quot;exceedingly many very old people of age, Shol&apos;ts says to declining meet also in some districts of China, in Japan or in a valley of Khunza in Pakistan, - is possible, live on Sardinia also&quot; are striking&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Scientific confirmation of age is however because of the absence of the documents impossible, since registers of the civil state weren&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> A glass of melted oil is each day </seg>
<seg id="1908"> There nevertheless is fact that the people in Lerika district strikingly often are at biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> 20 people older than 100 years now live here. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here, in the south, are the long-lived persons so much? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani excursion guide Farid Mugimzade explains it with the special genes of *TALYSh*. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of museum Fatulaeva conversely believes that he is an affair in supply. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> *TALYSh* like meat, bread and everything is more, a glass of melted oil drinks each day milk products, many of them However, hardly such a high calorie diet can be a healthy from dietologic viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is the affair in the primeval lifestyle which keeps the people the youth V Chengemirane, the tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, does Rubaba Mirzoyev live.? </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Into 97 years she is else comparatively young for this latitude. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzaeva which assert that at her 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, typical of only the Caucasian region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on a floor with the barrel of oil which tirelessly roll hither and thither. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here under one roof live 8 people including, at which one of the sons and daughter Mirzaevoj, long ago are their grandchildren already. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby two babies gallop. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In a kitchen tea is made for the guests, which gives in the typical big-bellied glasses armudu. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Ideally, the even and strong white teeth, are under the head kerchief she hides the long dark chestnut tresses which her son with pride discloses in front of us at Mirzaevoj. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always wash the hair with milk, so that they have never fallen out and have kept colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I have never used a shampoo&quot; -, Mirzaeva speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension isn&apos;t in short supply for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only the fact that have grown in an own yard, the tomatoes, potato, the pea. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In the whole life I never bought products in a shop. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells about her husband who served in an army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Was after the Second world war the heaviest of all. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But have become better, when &quot;favourite father&quot; Geydar Aliyev rose at a wheel. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda not often sounds in the old woman&apos;s speech. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However cult, created around a figure of the father of a nation who governed a country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically doesn&apos;t know the boundaries. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He had the power before 2003, then, his son Ilham has received the reins of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> There nevertheless is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old people. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (about equal to the same sum of the euro) monthly as pension, for the local conditions it is the sum on which it is possible well to live. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, son Mirzaevoj that has, perhaps, long ago grown is too right: &quot;the old People in our culture enjoy deep respect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, are favourite, is had in care and is happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> By what not the reason to remain in alive is as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is absent in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Competing demonstrations in Cairo testify to deep split in a country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, based on Shariat, has suffered furious rebuff. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president didn&apos;t begrudge pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;The success also in him lies on my responsibility to a people and in front of God&quot; -, he has said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was turned to the whole people, but primarily to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the educated Muslims and the non religious Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> However they all, hitherto hopelessly dissociated, are in lost opposition, fear is felt. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of the religious state on Nile on mercy &quot;of powerful Brothers-Muslims&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Mursi hardly whether not excusing has said that he temporarily cut down competence of the constitutional court and has expanded his competence &quot;to salvage a revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However the 61 year-old engineer, having the degree of a doctor of the American university of the Southern California, what in fact wants to salvage is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judicial power be deprived of force? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Night 15-hour download through in fact 234 articles succeeded in pulling in a constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and it partially causes fears with obstacles on to islamistski tuned. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As also in the previous constitutions, in the project it is told that the legal procedure leans &quot;against the principles of Islamic right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what means &quot;the principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was both more strict interpretation of Shariat remains interpretations and the, it is possible to fear that, Islamists will use the affair a nebulous statement and legal play for, arising in connection with it. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least at it hints, one innovative article: it is necessary to attract the university to advice there is Al-Ashar in all the affairs touching Shariat an islamistic institution is the most important is the countries the one that has the high authority in the whole Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It is not have to, but a restriction on the judicial power can mean that the clergy oversees legislation that de facto would have by investigation. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> In the project of the constitution is an item of interpretation much </seg>
<seg id="1958"> One more problem: suability of the civil faces to a military court must remain. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts in a period of the power of Mubarak served for suppression of the oppositionists. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> Up to 11.000 civil faces after overthrow of a dictator were in military confinement. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as said the project is in the state must guard &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;support its moral and the values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Juridically it is formulated so indistinctly that the state institutions with the help of this article will be able to monitor even the keeping of a movie and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> By the open text it means none other than the censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In general not an article single, sets equality of the men and the women straight. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But other forbids to insult and defame prophet Muhammed and his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But that such an insult also as it must be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Doubtful also seems a statement, which is forbidden, &quot;insult of the people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Will sufficiently caricature of the president or joke about a legist be? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation as also much in this project which Mursi proposes on signature and which, according to his words, it &quot;is very quick&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians on referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Opposition against the Islamists&apos; superiority is formed already several weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity of the evening of Friday on the area of Takhrir in Cairo and have sworn to destroy this document else before it will be able to enter force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned, and we shall defeat&quot; -, Khamdin Sabbakhi has said, having occupied the third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The laureate of the Nobel prize of peace and the former the head of the international department in atomic energy Mohammed El&apos;-Baradei has declared that to the project of the constitution the place &quot;is on dump of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Through a service of short news twitter he has accused proponents Mursi of a wish to head &quot;putsch against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he announces referendum we shall go to his palace and we shall throw him - off&quot;, oppositionist Yasser Sahid has said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We haven&apos;t got tired yet our brothers&apos; blood not otmshchena - yet&quot;, Egyptian the mass media of the oppositional politician *Haled* Ali cited. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many judges have also reported that they don&apos;t want to observe referendum, which would make him invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Orderly &quot;Brothers-Muslims&quot; in their turn have well called to opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not on Takhrir area, but after the mass prayer on the other shore of Nile in front of the Cairo university. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The large number of women under the coverlets and the proponents salafitov who cried: &quot;the People required an application of a divine law&quot; in her has taken part. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They have required of Mursi: &quot;Refine a country&quot;, and have been assured: &quot;Koran is our constitution&quot;.! </seg>
<seg id="1983"> The struggle for the power over the symbolic area with which all has begun on has provoked state of a practically civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Followers Mursi quite obviously didn&apos;t want to walk this risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> &quot;Brothers-Muslims&quot; have declared that both the opponents, and the partisans of the project of the constitution have spoken out loudly and clearly. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The time to allow a people solve at a ballot-box in what direction the country must go has now come. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Majority are behind the project of the Islamists, it reckons by the solved affair. </seg>

<seg id="1990"> The lawyer in human rights, 48 year-old, and the chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOPR) protected &quot;Brothers-Muslims&quot;, when with Mubarak they sat in a prison or appeared from a court. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because, what he divided their world outlook, and therefore human rights for it are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For it he was beaten, sentenced, arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And now the words &quot;human rights&quot; never occur in the new constitution, it regrets in a talk &quot;with Welt am Sonntag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of Mursi influence all three branches of the power in the state disappoints a lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are the obvious blows at the democratic rules of a game and will bring the Egyptians to new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of the fact to reinforce the civil state the president de facto annuled him&quot; - Saeda regrets. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However without the civil public organizations the democracy cannot function. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels that everybody has abandoned him, even the international community which sees ideological struggle of the directions on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>

<seg id="2002"> At the five million population of Norway one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Somehow is the perhaps mystery of success of this country connected with local predilection for one exceedingly rank fish dish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take several pieces of cheese that have become overripe. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them into heap of the dirty and sweaty sports clothes. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> The smell rakfiska - of one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies striking smell you will be able. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small small town by name Fagernes in three hours of ride from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Round there are the picturesque kinds, covered with snow, It very beautiful, but in air poured out ineradicable characteristic smell. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> It is a Rakfisk - trout is strewn with a salt and being wandering around water before a year, into dependence from what just that odour it is necessary to attain. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As twilight thickens, and it grows colder, the crowds of the Norwegians gather on festival in Fagernese, dedicated to it itself, the dish, we shall say so, capturing. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;She is eaten with raw and takes to drink the wineglass of aquavit, local caraway vodka&quot; -, Khavard Khal&apos;varsen, explains, the local fireman is by a profession and in pluralism &quot;the rakfiskovyj general&quot; which leads execution of festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Everywhere around us the people eat a fish, sliced off the small cubes, and wash her down with the considerable portions of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Aquavit more pleases than rakfisk - Khavard speaks somebody&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This beverage is capable of interrupting smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I taste a couple of pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If it proves possible to carry a piece under the nose then everything is not so already and badly - in few things differ from the portion of the dry spell which you long carried with it in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk - it is Norwegian product from quite different times, times of poverty, when before appearance of the refrigerators yet the fish in autumn was soaked in the hermetically closed barrels with salty water. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then in deep winter, when the fish already well and solidly began, to ferment she was extracted and, fading down perception by alcohol, used into food. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> On the memory of the past generation yet it is that fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced abandon the country in search for work and emigrate in the main way to the USA. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now the population swiftly grows - the immigrants whom the work places, the high salaries and a developed system of a social support carry here are more than 13 %. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The inhabitants of Sweden (long-standing the rival, and yet not so long ago, and more are able of a well-off neighbour) in a mass come here to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is perceived, an element of the past of Norway is as a certain important symbol, indispensable, just also somewhat rank. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> On the other hand here everything is expensive - the small goblet of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds sterling (14 US dollars). </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway seldom appears in world news, and, it seems, the majority of the inhabitants of a country make it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The people here hitherto reluctantly mention name Andersa Brejvika of the racist and an extremist of the right use in the last year that has shot and has killed 77 men, the women and the children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Not mentioning his name terrorist action is named &quot;having happened on 22 July&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> To the Norwegians come to believe that in their peaceable country one of their fellow citizens has turned out capable of similar brutalities and murders is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Growth (from the beginning of the seventieth) of one of the largest oil and gas branches in the world provides basis of today&apos;s well-being of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;Petroleum - is not however sole the cause of our prosperity&quot; - Anna, says, our waitress, is a woman, delivering the trays with self-possessed rakfiskom, with the thick light hair and the strikingly blue eyes incarnation of Nordic well-being. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> How you name - it we are such a people - prudent. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> As also the Norwegians&apos; majority she beautifully speaks English. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We don&apos;t like to be exhibited on a show, we are not boastful. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway very sparingly handles its petroleum - the large part of the incomes of oil and gas branch is invested in a special fund, created for good of the future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> In the years that were preceding the world financial crisis, when everybody littered money which they hadn&apos;t, Norway parsimoniously counted all expenditures. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as it is possible to roll the skis in winter and go into expeditions in summer it is sufficiently happiness&quot; -, Anna speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And rakfisk, - is&quot;, she adds with unconcerned laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand in a queue for some food - from me there will be enough rakfiska in snow. </seg>

<seg id="2067"> &quot;We connect hopes for real and serious changes - with him&quot;, his friend and political ally Gabriel Ol&apos;vera Ernandes, the congressman of the state from headed of Singing N&apos;eto of an institutional-revolutionary batch (PRI) speak. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect the present and resolute changes which so sharply are necessary for our country of primarily the domain of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years of continuous term of office the party PRI was forced out in 2000 Visente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Ol&apos;vera recognizes that after his 12 summer absence in a presidential palace of Los-Pinos the party sets ardent hopes for Enrique Pen&apos;ya N&apos;eto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Besides that he refutes the accusations of inanity which opposition has made the new president. </seg>

<seg id="2076"> Concealed under the overpasses of the highways he in many senses is the suburb of the Mexico city itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in a municipality too have the strong character of this megapolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Before the troops; and violence with respect to the women in this year for pacification of the gangs, vending the drugs in these districts, were attracted, the specially sharp character wears here. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Several tens of the killed women&apos;s bodies were detected on a vacant plot near vast dump only in the last two years. </seg>

<seg id="2081"> According to the words of the opponents of a gentleman of Singing of N&apos;eto to about him say he hasn&apos;t managed to cope with the problem of the murder of the women is in the best case possible what time of the stay at the governor&apos;s office. </seg>

<seg id="2089"> This family according to their words was refused just it. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The officials of the state handled me as with an old gossiper, the discontented violator of calm. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want the people to just admit everything that they say, and kept silent on belief. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, so impossible when especially round so there are many violations and the shortages&quot; -, she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Putting on a presidential baldric on Saturday the president of Singing of N&apos;eto together with her will take uneasy responsibility on himself. </seg>

<seg id="2096"> The families of the victims in S&apos;yudad-Nesa however most of all fear just it. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bredli Manning didn&apos;t complain about bad appeal, accusation declares. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutors try to refute the declarations Bredli Manning about the bad conditions of content is under guard. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> In the process of hearing increased attention was spared Manning&apos;s stay in a military prison into Kvantiko, the state is Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Protection requires to close an affair on that base that the conditions of confinement of Manning were cruel. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The USA accuse the private of an army of stealing of several thousand secret documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday tried to prove accusation of, a the, that private Bredli Manning, accused the largest leakage of the classified materials into stories of the USA, haven&apos;t used set possibilities to give a complaint about the bad appeal which according to his words has *have_occasion* him transfer being in a military prison. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross interrogation there is Forth-on the prejudicial hearing in the Foreign Ministry the military prosecutor major Eshden Fejn has lodged that the recordings of the weekly visits to Manning by the representatives of the administration of a prison in nine months of its content in the state of Virginia, Kvantiko, the complaints about bad appeal aren&apos;t contained the state of Maryland. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross interrogation within the framework of consideration of intercession of protection for cessation of an affair of Manning on the base of the fact that the conditions of its confinement were cruel and in itself was sufficient punishment was conducted for the next day after Manning has declared that being in custody it intended to commit suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The military specialist in analysis of the intelligences, the prisoner is in June 2010 is accused of stealing of several thousand secret documents during a service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> These materials were hereafter published on the Internet on the site WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The resource WikiLeaks hasn&apos;t confirmed that just Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During hearing on Friday prosecutor Fejn has together with Manning viewed the reports which filled in after the visits to Manning by the representatives of an administration during his stay in prison Kvantiko, where he was on the conditions of a strict regime of confinement from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> During attendances the serving prisons asked Manning the questions and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When prosecutor Fejn asked on Friday about the reports Manning has recognized that appeal to himself on the part of the administration of a prison as &quot;excellent&quot;, and the common conditions of confinement as &quot;very professionally orderly&quot; estimate. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The considered reports don&apos;t contain the complaints about bad appeal notwithstanding the fact that Manning was straight asked about the conditions of its content, Fejn asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning has answered that he expressed oral concern with these problems his representatives that what were also visiting of an administration discussed these problems with it and declared that they would start to be dealt, but didn&apos;t fix it in the writing kind. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They recorded &quot;the problems were absent&quot; (after discussion of my complaints), but it doesn&apos;t mean that I didn&apos;t raise this theme in a talk&quot; -, Manning speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> Military the judge, the colonel, the De bottom, Lind, have too asked Manning why one didn&apos;t complain, on illegal appeal with it in January 2011, the suitsidal&apos;nye intentions which it expressed by the the that during a session commission was considering writing kind behind is several months before that old. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning has answered that during that session it wanted to attain that from him has been removed a mode &quot;of traumatism prevention&quot;, and the conditions of confinement have been softened. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The representatives of the military leadership have explained that the the limited mode of confinement - on level below than is a mode of supervision with a view on prevention of suicide - was brought in for the protection of a prisoner, as well as for the sake of security of other. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to allow an administration must know that with me still in an order, so that they cancel a mode of traumatism prevention, that, the level of my life has improved from my viewpoint&quot; -, Manning has explained. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and a translation to Kuwait where almost two months contained him before have been transfered to a prison in a naval base into Kvantiko, the state of Virginia, is in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He has reported that the ideas of suicide have occurred to it in Kuwait, and that has once it lost consciousness because of high heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He has explained that it psychologically is very hard, when you don&apos;t let know how your fate, resolves, and what happens in the external world. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world has contracted before a base of Kemp-Arifzhan before the sizes of my prison -, Manning on Thursday has said. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> -I thought that I would die in this cage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Finding in Kvantiko, Manning, according to his words, conducted the large part of the time in a small chamber - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours per twenty four hours - in full solitude. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning reports that for him it has been permitted to leave only a mattress, the blanket, several items of the clothes and the spectacles are the bedroom slippers. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He says that he tried to move, for to sleep or even just lie in daytime forbade the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> The light, penetrating outside a chamber, according to the words of Manning during sleep, him permanently beat at the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards didn&apos;t see his face, when it turned over in a bed in the night then according to his words he was awakened and made turn over to the back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer has given official objection concerning illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011 Manning was transfered to a military prison into Forth-Livenvort, the state of Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Besides that on Friday the judge inquired Manning about the declaration which he has made during testification on Thursday of the fact that after in the night it was once made to sleep stripped in his chamber into Kvantiko, he has been starved into to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners on the morning checkup. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning has declared that he hadn&apos;t a possibility to cover oneself with a blanket during a checkup. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Answering with the questions of a judge on Friday Manning has said that he has understood from an order of the guard that it must throw a blanket with which would be able to cover oneself but have recognized that nobody straight ordered to it to throw him. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday Manning declared that in the previous night it had been made to sleep naked because of his attempt to show to an officer that he doesn&apos;t constitute danger for himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning has reported that he has told the officer that he would be able to use the cowards&apos; elastic or the bedroom slippers to traumatize himself, but haven&apos;t made it. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> In that night according to Manning&apos;s evidence his bottom linen, the bedroom slippers and the spectacles took away from a chamber. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge at least will take the fact that it has had to outlive during confinement, and considerably will reduce a term of confinement if Manning is recognized as culpable by the military court which must begin consideration of its affair at the beginning of the next year into account. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Protection has declared that it plans to propose to Manning to recognize guilt of less serious crimes, and dispute other accusations as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of hearings is planned for this weekend, it is expected that the side of accusation will insist on the fact that the conditions of keeping in custody were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Pentagon asserts that Manning was present in Kvantiko in accordance with the rules, adjusting keeping of the prisoners with a maximally strict regime. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Pandering for Manning to an opponent, illegal assistance to promulgation in the a furnished Internet transfer information, concerning national defense, and stealing of the state property or the documents are reckoned among made accusations. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is condemned over all points of the accusatory act life imprisonment can threaten him. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the American&apos;s short story is of Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> In the author&apos;s opinion many Mexicans were forced abandon Mexico because of the absence of the possibilities to realize oneself. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans are apt to accuse ones who have left, because they remind the inhabitants of a country complicated times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> *Ruben* Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin burst between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent journey to the Mexico city I have gone around a corridor for coming, have approached a zone of the border control and have congealed at a place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> The signs pointed two queues: alone for Mexicanos (the Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (the foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was faced several seconds with them not knowing where to walk. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I have grown in the central California, and I was named the whole life the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> This just conditional name, like how my friends in Boston name themselves the Irishmen, and the friends from New York believe themselves the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> I have later stopped on a complicated construction &quot;American of Mexican origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> The need for the conditional names or the complicated constructions wasn&apos;t here, at my grandfather&apos;s home. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just the American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I say in the Spanish way to ask the questions or answer sufficiently with good for that them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my dictionary reserve is poorer than that of the carriers of a language, and I cannot get rid of an American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> I have therefore come and have stood into a queue for Extranjeros by my American passport. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I recollected this history several days ago, when again elected president of Mexico Enrique Pen&apos;ya N&apos;eto visited the White house and has met president Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> The questions: about immigration, the drugs and trade, habitual for the meetings with the presidents of these countries, stood on agenda. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The president of Singing of N&apos;eto willingly spoke rise of Mexican economy due to which, the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico instead of the fact to get across to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign an agreement on the partnership with the USA and Canada and create a certain north American trading block like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Besides that the president of Singing of N&apos;eto has promised to continue a war against the drug cartels in Mexico, no particular offers have however sounded. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico relations with the United States are the heavy and full of old resentments question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The Americans&apos; majority have never pondered the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the muzzle of the rifles have forced her leaders to decline the half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans think the centuries, and not the minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It therefore is worth missaying only any state worker the USA by just the word of criticism to a side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society the complaints about the fact that the Americans encroach upon sovereignty of the neighbours here sound. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants are filled by bellicosity with Monte&apos;s bag. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, living in the USA, in this case are the most complicated. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Do you want to speak about resentments? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> They are sufficiently. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> There in Mexico are winners and the people who find in this country for themselves of the possibility, and ones for whom there are no such possibilities that have lost. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is so many people of Mexican origin only for one cause: at some moment of their family story anybody is a father or is a grandfather - hadn&apos;t a possibility to realize himself in Mexico and was forced depart to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The most often of all it was the Mexicans of definite type - swarthy, insufficiently well-educated from the poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember about it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> It is seen in Mexico otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our life - it is incarnation of American dream we studied at the good schools and have settled down on good works, but us not forget the fact that even this dream - American, and not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination is entangled and it is unclear, but we know what country to believe own. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The united States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite of the also governing class don&apos;t love us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We answer with the same to them. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see reminder of the humiliating defeats in us and treat us as to the people of the second sort as to the factitious Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We insufficiently well speak Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our existence for them itself is explained with the failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico they wouldn&apos;t leave. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We wouldn&apos;t turn out now behind the silk curtain, finding full life in the USA but losing the spiritual connections. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife has been born in Guadalajara and has legally moved to the USA as far back as in childhood, and reminds of it me the fact that between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin exist definite frictions - the Mexicans more distinctly understand their national identity, and Mexican origin it it hurts the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She the citizen of the USA also believes, which to both these countries belongs. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> In the same time many my familiar Americans of Mexican origin feel belonging not to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to a Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love also Bruce Springstina. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Receiving the best from two worlds you unavoidably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico we are the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the USA we are named the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I have elucidated during my journey, as though our relations without that insufficiently is entangled, some Mexican leaders and the representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as the their kind ambassadors of Mexico and awaked her interests to the USA. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would be able to tell our friends-Americans about it is what beautiful country also as to visit her superbly is, and the political leaders could be persuaded to strengthen the connections with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> It aha is finite. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will be produced. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Resentments in the past are too much. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And taking rupture of the rich and poor, rampancy of corruption and drug trade, into account many of us quite don&apos;t believe this country of such already beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Excuse, but understand it oneself, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And it is just. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the Mexicans&apos; part hitherto cannot forgive the United States that how they have treated Mexico, one and a half centuries ago, they will have to receive, and it is that fact that some Americans of Mexican origin all in resentment that in Mexico have how quite recently treated their kinsmen yet. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes already. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps with us more common than to me seemed. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battles are in the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The agreement on cessation of a fire between Israel and grouping of the Hamas can become the fragile foundation for the farther world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East possible? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The next round pushes bloodsheds from a conclusion of futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> One sounds, who is the first have started; meaningless arguments on that that have become habitual, the set of the buildings is converted into ruins; six Israelis; the rockets, for the first time in the time of a conflict, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, have fallen into killed above 140 Palestinians whose majority have been the civil faces, and vicinity of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> Changes however notwithstanding the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians have hopelessly bogged their conflict since early *TIME1* have come to the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> Is to possible treat it differently, the events &quot;of Arab spring&quot; have however begun to whirl in a rebellious storm a set of realities that have settled down, and the Palestinians and the Israelis haven&apos;t succeeded in remaining aside from whirlwind that has shocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> By what, perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even bloodier earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> The causes, giving hope for an exit from this deadly lockup, however exist. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war without the winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> On the first glance the situation that has been formed doesn&apos;t give the causes of optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cessation of the fire on which the agreement was signed on 21 November realizes itself collisions that have happened in this week have only strengthened the positions of the power structure people from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of islamistic movement of the Hamas that has come to the power in sector Gaza in 2007, will be declared, from, the fact that they have forced Israel to retreat notwithstanding suffered by them losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Notwithstanding the fact that some leaders of a group were destroyed, and the inhabitants are blocked with 1,7 million in one of the most populous and problem corners of our planet Israel hasn&apos;t succeeded in destroying the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact the Hamas accrues its popularity on the West bank of the river Jordan - one more Palestinian territory, monitored currently by the more moderate movement of the Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> More than that the leaders of the Hamas quite can draw a conclusion that the time works in them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The new influential and rich friends in the process of growth of influence of islamistic movements in the Arab world appear at the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> The regenerating regional the leader Turkey which long ago was the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, has come forward with a support of the Hamas; its example, Qatar, has followed, one of richest and is dynamic developing states of the Persian gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The triumphing partisans of the Hamas declare the Hizballah about creation around Israel of an islamistic crescent - from Lebanon in the north in which the militarized group governs before Syria the in whom, still more are further before Jordan, where the authorities of the king are the proislamistic insurgents very soon will overthrow power Bashar Assada, and the allies of the Hamas threaten. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The the most significant change of balance of forces has occurred in the region on the southern borders of Israel, in the itself populous and important Arab country, in Egypt where the influence of movement Fraternity-the Muslims with president Muhammed Mursi has hardened. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Khosni Mubarak who governed Egypt during 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator that wasn&apos;t giving close attention to a support of the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Brothers-Muslims conversely are an organization, in much similar to the Hamas, and their leaders are apter to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic arrangements the Hamas can become a significant player whose voice even Israel and America won&apos;t succeed in choking. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> In the same time the partisans of a &quot;rigid&quot; line in Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In a military sense the Hamas was plunged. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli antimissile system &quot;the Iron dome&quot; has justified expenditures for its creation and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets, launched by the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least some is time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> What concerns diplomacy the USA have remained faithful to their invariant position; many European countries have also laid guilt of the beginning of the last round of violence on the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> One more important factor is economic prosperity of Israel especially push forward the government Bin&apos;yamina Netanyahu who to a significant extent ignored a peaceful process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Notwithstanding the fact that since 2004 approximately 30 Israelis have been killed from the rockets, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, Israel has succeeded in reducing the problem of the terrorists-kamikazes partly at the expense of the wall which enters the territory of the West bank of the river Jordan - the significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to be expanded notwithstanding illegality of such actions from a viewpoint of international legislation to the minimum. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of prime minister Netanyahu, Likud whose party are within the framework of preparation for the election - have united with the conservatives, even more aggressively inclined, under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman planned for 22 January very comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What sense to connive with the Palestinians and present the own state to them? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If give back the whole power in the territory of the West bank into their arms won&apos;t they begin to launch a rocket from there to a side of Israel, as do their brothers in sector Gaza make it? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind a wall and rigidly suppress any attempts to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the partisans of a &quot;rigid&quot; line will win a victory; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The internal problems at the fact that the Islamists who come to the power in Egypt and other countries feel not the warmest emotions about Israel will become their priority task. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense part of a budget of Israel is larger than that of its all Arab neighbours together taken. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Untying of a war with a regional superpower hardly will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism of the president of Egypt Mursi which jointly with Barak Obama worked on cessation of a fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of changes with itself. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel to a not smaller extent must take long-term consequences of its policy into account. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> In the process of approach of democratic changes of the Arab countries deprivation of the Palestinians of self-determination right is the bomb of delayed action which early or late will explode in the occupied by Israel territories, like a bus, exploded in Tel Aviv in this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repressions already blow up fundamentals of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is growth of the Arab population - only aggravate these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For the bloody operations which are performed each several years in the territory of sector Gaza for suppression of movement of the Hamas one has to pay with growing discontent of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need the external impulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Remains the sole solution for which tirelessly the sensible representatives from both sides, as well as the large part of the remaining world and our newspaper: formation of two states and concessions by Israel of the territories in exchange for security call. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, not too imposing in short-term prospect, - hope what cessation of a fire will allow other countries remain, it is more effective to influence the sides of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt is a for which long ago time to make decision to overlap deliveries of the weapons sector Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have an advantageous position to persuade the Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, accepted since the year 1967 of the one that considers exchange of the territories and joint use of Jerusalem, at its disposal as never. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries also must make the efforts conciliation of movements of the Hamas and the Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would make more for creation of the Palestinian state than the forthcoming voting in the UN result of which confession virtual statehood of Palestine can become. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Also president Obama must play his role in the fact to seat Israel at a table of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he after all hasn&apos;t presented an own plan of peaceful settlement. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After return from the White house he, as before, demonstrates unwillingness to switch to a solution of a given problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a catastrophically shortsighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The united States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> It is possible only in a case of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia the law of a unified package for the cigarettes has entered force. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The warnings about harm of smoking and the image of struck with the diseases of the parts of the body are contrastively allocated on the cheerless green boxes, similar for all trademarks of the cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in world practice Australian law of a similar package of the cigarettes and the tobacco articles has entered into force, replacing the logotypes and the coloured finalization of the different trademarks the similar box of cheerless-olive colour of the eery photographs of the parts of the body, struck with a disease, and with the children&apos;s images, the health of which are blown up by smoking of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Besides the different pictures and the inscriptions, warning the sole distinction between the packets of harm of smoking, brought in in an obligatory order from this Saturday - the name of the marks which are printed by the similar shallow font. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the conditions of finalization of the packages of the tobacco articles, sternest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia declares that it is aim of this measure to retain the youth smoking depriving this bad habit of the fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Results of investigations that have shown that the people that haven&apos;t begun to smoke before 26 years in 99 cases from 100 so never also became the smokers have lain down into basis of such a solution. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is obvious that even at the youngest age the children understand the sense which the tobacco companies try to bring with the help of finalization of a package&quot; -, health minister Tanya Plibersek explains refering to investigations that have shown that, for example the crown in a logotype associated itself with the children with the princess&apos; idea. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries from least in the world of the smokers&apos; shares, so that these changes not specially tell on the profit of the transnational corporations, also the different countries however consider the possibility of taking of similar measures already. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The representatives of tobacco industry intensively counteracted acceptance of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco companies assert that it only will increase a share of the black market on which the cheap and accessible cigarettes will sell themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will have serious consequences, different from ones who were conceived by his originators&quot; - Scott Makintajr, the representative of a company of British American Tobacco in Australia believes. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The producers of false produce from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for a sale in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For somebody conversely new laws contribute to growth of business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Kha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd assert that how the demand for the cigarette cases and the silicon etuis, concealing the disagreeable pictures on a package, swiftly, has grown (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies of British American Tobacco British Imperial Tobacco Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco has lost a case in a high court of Australia where tried to appeal against a given law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to the words of Sandra Kha the company of Zico has already realized about six thousand articles of wholesale trade to the enterprises and expects a new batch. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Popularity of social networks among just that part of the population on which these measures are directed is in the experts&apos; opinion potential hindrance to effectiveness of similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After acceptance in Australia of a series of laws that have made illegal TV advertisement of the cigarettes and a support by them of sports actions, as well as forbidding to the sellers to exhibit the cigarettes at a visible place advertisement of the tobacco articles has moved into the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The government of Australia has forbidden to the local companies and the websites to locate advertisement on network, but it cannot restrict the foreign sites in it. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;if *YOU* *VEND1* *tobacco* *ARTICLE1* *ALSO*/*EVEN1* *YOU* *HAVE* *ONLY1* this small *LOOP-HOLE*, *IDEA* *BE* *ADVANCE2*/*FURTHER* own *GOODS* on *INTERNET1* *SEEM* *YOU* extremely *tempting*&quot;, - *EXPLAIN* *bey* Friman, *INVESTIGATE*/*RESEARCH2* *QUESTION1* public/social *HEALTH* at *UNIVERSITY* *SYDNEY*. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman notes growth of the number of reviews of the trademarks, written from the face of allegedly the common users, how there is YouTube on the such social networks for twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Does the question - whether this affair of the arms of the ordinary citizen who so likes cigarettes Marlboro that haven&apos;t pitied forces and the time and have made video, or does the advertising company stand behind it is actual arise? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian section on a company of British American Tobacco asserts that now more are occupied by adaptation to the new rules with a branch than advertisement. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The representatives of tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for contestation of the new rules: these states make the complaint in the frames declaring that that trade has been subject to the world Trade organization unfair, the restrictions, notwithstanding the fact that trading relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The solution of WTO is expected to the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to the words of Tanya Plibersek the government discussed a possibility of acceptance by them of analogous laws of a package with other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001 Canada introduced for the first obligatorily locating of the photographs, warning of harm of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now this rule is received in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of toughening of laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> The set of the smokers in Australia ostentatiously doesn&apos;t obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures don&apos;t graze me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You just snatch away a cigarette and you hide a packet to a pocket&quot; -, Victor El&apos; Khejg, buying the cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor of the oral cavity on a packet, explains. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> It is honest saying the sole that can to make me throw - it is my small daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Ju, managing a shop of tobacco articles King of the Pack at the center of Sydney, asserts that the similar package has complicated a task of arrangement of goods from the regiments </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;The hour, and now four hours - earlier with me went away, he complains, on unloading of a new batch&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;To take and quite forbid the cigarettes we close a shop -, he speaks throwing up the arms up, was is for the government necessary, we then would say: what it do, is well-formed everything was finished&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> To miss in the world of electronic networks and the constants of wiring-ups - it is not so already is also bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport, because at our plane have transpired mechanical malfunctions and have replaced him with the other plane for which we also waited. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus with me it was sufficient the time of reflections on nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I shan&apos;t deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day in an airport in expectation of a trip is indeed boring, and here neither the books nor the magazines, nor an iPhone, nor even the magazines of duty-free trade strongly will help. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> However, in towards the last time still more scientists and the specialists children&apos;s development speak out in favour to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in the definite situations for us and for our children not to miss so already is also bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to abstract on the interesting adjacent themes, which perhaps contributes to creation. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And since in the modern world we all permanently are in front of some screen, advantages of boredom pass by us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Can it be for us necessary to strive boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> And. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And in the same time *ISN&apos;T*. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We shall return some more to it. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Earlier I as also many believed that boredom was invention regarding recent times, when at the people appeared more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> It is not so, asserts Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, the author of a book &quot;the Fascinating history of boredom&quot; (Boredom: A Lively History Yale University Press of 2011).. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact boredom can boast about very ancient history&quot; -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls the Latin inscriptions, about boredom dated the first century, are detected in Pompeii. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> In this case the question about that, as we understand boredom remains open. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem in, John D.. speaks, Istvud what, understanding and vision of boredom are the adjunct-professor of the University York is in Ontario, Canada, often varied. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Studying the materials of investigations into this theme and asking a question for the target group there is a person professor Istvud and his colleague in 100, send to the next definition: boredom - it when the people &quot;want, but cannot deal with the fact that would give them satisfaction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he speaks, consists in the fact that the missing person doesn&apos;t make anything that would want to make. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> One doesn&apos;t want at apathy to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main thing in experienced boredom, he, speaks, this &quot;violation of attention and deterioration of mood and a feeling of the fact that the time stretches slowly, connected with it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Over a description boredom can seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However professor Istvud asserts that notwithstanding a possible connection between these states the missing people see the causes of the problems in the ambient world and circumstances, and the people experiencing depression, see the problems in himself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> It seems that we feel boring, when in fact we find it just difficult on something to concentrate occasionally to us. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In one&apos;s investigation &quot;the Unoccupied mind: definition of boredom from a viewpoint of attention&quot;, professor Istvud, with the colleagues refer to the experiment, the published in September production of a magazine of Perspectives on Psychological Science carried out earlier, of which the participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> The participants alone heard also the loud sounds of broadcast, included in a neighbouring room, not relating to an affair, other heard the same sounds on low of loudness, so that it hardly was possible to disassemble them, and the third group listened only to a recording of the voice without the outside sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard the TV set with the low level of loudness noted, by what they felt boring more often than other - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn&apos;t know its cause and ascribed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to concentrate attention in the difficult or fascinating task interruption of attention can cause boredom, Marc Dzh.. Fenske, the adjunct-professor of neurology at the University of *GVEL&apos;F*, Ontario, and one of the authors of given investigation speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we make anything uninteresting, &quot;for example scrutinizing a stream of the articles on a conveyor in search for defect distracting music can help to avoid boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is believed, he continues, that when the people begin to rock on a chair or draw scribble on a sheet of paper, they make it from boredom, however now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The investigation has shown that the children who *ISN&apos;T* forbidden to dodge about and revolve, study better and memorize more information than the children which require to sit quietly&quot; -, professor Fenske asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> At some moments we all test boredom: in the delay of a trip (as in my case), listening to monotonic speech, viewing an uninteresting film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However the different people demonstrate the different degree of inclination for boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980th years for measurement of such individual peculiarities the researchers developed a special &quot;scale of inclination for boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The questions and, for example, &quot;Much from the fact that I have to make assertion, monotonously and monotonously&quot; or, &quot;is too much interesting therefore there isn&apos;t enough for Me time anything&quot; are used for definition of estimation by such a scale. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The with the help of such questionaries, the researchers have defined that the boys miss as more frequent than the girls, - Steven Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at the University of the Western Florida, - says especially push forward, presence of the versatile external irritants. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However on the whole the teenagers in general often miss. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> There is Reed Larson in 1991, the professor of personality and public development at the University of Illinois, has carried out the experiment in the process of which he communicated almost with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times per day with the help of a pager. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He has received the next results: 32 % of teenagers have declared the fact that they feel boring is at a school and during execution of homework, and 23 % have declared the fact that they feel boring is beyond the limits of the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In this case only 3 % of parents have noted that they feel boring. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he hasn&apos;t data which similar data on boredom would be now after 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However he knows that &quot;on adolescent age falls a peak of inclination for boredom&quot; in the main thing, because the children and the teenagers aren&apos;t allowed in the full measure to decide they must with what start to deal. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Shall we return to my initial question: boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Occasionally isn&apos;t, because in the extreme manifestations she, as investigations show, can push the people from absurd and dangerous in physical actions, the venturous gambling games or abuse of the definite substances in attempts to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand many philosophers and the writers pondered a connection between boredom and creation, professor Vodanovich that has dedicated to study of this problem more than two decades speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain prompts us that it is necessary to start to deal with something else; it also is boredom&quot; - Gary Markus, the professor of psychology at the New York university speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However not always know this most brain, is with what just better to start to deal. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you will feel boring, and you will direct this energy on a game at a guitar or culinary experiments, you will make for yourselves better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However if you begin to see the TV set you will feel better only for some time, and soon it will elapse. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Therefore if your child misses, and you give an iPad to him he will stop missing, however he won&apos;t learn to struggle with boredom independently or somehow the other mode control his time and occupancy -, professor Fenske speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And such skills in independent adjustment are used for the most different situations&quot; -, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child studies not only independently to occupy himself with something, he also studies the *SELF1* control in general. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that to extoll boredom is necessary somehow. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> It however isn&apos;t worth counting her in anything bad too. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It rather is necessary to study to feel comfortably even beyond a continuous stream of actions and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Istvud agrees on it. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see it is so that it is for us necessary to more often test boredom at the fact that to start to deal with something meaningful - is the boredom is extremely disagreeable strong wish&quot;, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact the people strive somehow tune out great cares and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world we have got accustomed to permanent excessive stimulation of the organs of emotions -, he - speaks, and when silence, sets up, we get lost and we don&apos;t know that make&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is so far unclear how the new law of legalization of marihuana in the state of Colorado will apply </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orosko, the nineteen year-old player of the football team and a student of a public college in the south-east of the state of Colorado is accused of committing of criminal crime, consisting in the fact that it soon will be perfectly lawful in the whole territory of the state: storage of the small portion of marihuana and the tube in which he smoked her. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr Orosko says that once in September he was with the friends into Lamare and went by automobile over a prairie near the border with Kansas, when them stopped the policemen. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the policeman has detected marihuana in a machine Mr Orosko, summons to a court has come for storage of the drugs and possession of gadget use of the drugs - shallow delicts for each of which, a fine into is due the size of 100 dollars - and the date of the judicial session is appointed. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;One handles as with the criminals - us&quot;, Mr Orosko speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is he the criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the ambiguity which continues already several weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for legalization of use of marihuana in small quantities for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of shallow judicial affairs doesn&apos;t depend so much from a law how much from a place of consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Accusations of shallow delicts, connected with marihuana, film in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington which has taken analogous measure already. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police areas have already stopped making accusations of the the people age are 21 years and are older for storage of small doses, which will come to be believed lawful, once across a couple of weeks the law will enter force, old. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> In the more conservative districts of Colorado the prosecutors have however made a decision to consider the existing cases, connected with marihuana, and over previous make responsible for storage of this drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> In the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain districts of the West is voted for the fact not to allow appearance in their places, new, licensed by the state of the magazines over a sale of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All of it develops so swiftly that I even don&apos;t know what to expect further&quot; -, Daniel Dzh.. Outs speaks, the head of the police, there is Aurora in the east of Denver in the small town. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The representatives of the monitoring organs in the state of Washington too perplexed scratch the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are in for forming of the rules for definition, about licensing of breeding, treatment, dissemination, both are the sales of marihuana, and to all of it make before 1 December 2013 is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, it is or it is bad good outpaces the majority of other states settlement of the questions of marihuana use at first in medical aims, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;There is a more ordered market in Colorado, therefore they will serve as a good example&quot; -, Bryan I.. Smith, the representative of the council for adjustment of production and a sale of alcoholic produce in the state of Washington explains. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now nobody can make more, Mr Smith recognizes, than make some offers and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We haven&apos;t real precedent to which we would be able to orientate - oneself&quot;, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Bill of the state of Washington I-502, is named, will enter force 6 December and for the entire year will plunge the state in state of ambiguity, when of the system, there is no state-licensing more, and the right of marihuana possession is legitimated already. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And exist however not the else simple technical aspects is to which necessary solve in this period, for example as find equilibrium between an order of the state &quot;for adequate access&quot; to licensed marihuana with a ban on her trade at the distance of 1000 ft from the schools, the parks, the playing platforms and the kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It will be especially complicated to locate the licensed enterprises of marihuana trade in a line of the cities in particular in Seattle and its suburbs&quot; -, Ben Livingston, the representative of the recently formed research group &quot;Center of marihuana legalization&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November the head of the police Outs sent a message of the fact that the prosecutor&apos;s office of the city more won&apos;t make the faces that have been at the age of 21 years responsible for possession of the small quantity of marihuana, and that the police stop proving the people guilty of given violations &quot;beginning with this moment&quot; from Aurora to his subordinates by an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The head of the police Outs has reported that the police will watch observance in the city of the rules, adjusting activity of the faces, breeding marihuana in medical aims, and will pursue the illegal dealers and the spreaders of the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The prosecutor of a district of Ueld in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a stricter approach to this question. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After a voting over a bill he has declared that the prosecutor&apos;s office will make as before responsible for possession of marihuana in the main way to impel her using persons to study course for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At a given moment accusations of storage against two and ounces of marihuana, are although many of them are accused also of other violations less are made 119 faces. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;It is duty of our institution to pursue for the actions which are believed criminal at a moment of of them accomplishment&quot; -, Mr Tank in the declaration has said. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction was ambiguous even in such places as Mesa rural district where the participants of a voting have refused offer of marihuana legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police Grandee Dzhankshn more don&apos;t make the largest city in a district responsible the adults for possession of the small quantity of drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District prosecutor Pete Khauttsinger has supported this solution, but has also decided not to drop accusations in even the open affairs, connected with storage of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to insure observance of a law, until it varies is our direct duty&quot; -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Notwithstanding the fact that 55 % of inhabitants of the state are Colorado, this solution, inclusion of the questions of use of marihuana for entertainments into the state and legal system have supported having taken part in a voting won&apos;t be simple. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the inhabitants&apos; contradictory reaction in the different places of the state has stripped ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment of the state with marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The cultural barrier - with the district prosecutors exists, explains Sean McAllister, the Denver lawyer, awaking the convicts&apos; interests for storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of reformation of laws over marihuana, in this question&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They so long prosecuted the people for it, that now cannot really reconcile oneself with that that it *BE* already not the crime&quot; -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states in which the marihuanas relate to small quantity as as to alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in a scale of the country for a checkup of the idea of legalization of the drugs itself. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> The partisans of legalization and the officials of the state, it is planned to expand the territory of legalized trade, but in the same time, they with caution expect indications from federal the authorities which are as before, volplane to consider a sale and breeding of marihuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The partisans of marihuana legalization hope that the Control will be inferior to justice in this question. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> The federal government in the majority of the cases has given notwithstanding several arrests of the dealers and the patients that have received wide resonance being using marihuana over the medical testimonies for trade in marihuana in medical aims in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> The agents of a Bureau of struggle with the drugs hardly will break in into the houses to confiscate small the small package the marihuanas, however they hardly will begin to close the eyes with the shops, adjusted by the authorities of the state, which resolved according to a new law, Kevin A.. Sabet, the former adviser on the questions of struggle with the drugs in the administration of Obama believes, of recreational marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Any cities in Colorado wouldn&apos;t wait for actions of the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the presidential election yet some local administrations have approved of a moratorium on the discovery of the new shops over a sale of marihuana which also so wouldn&apos;t be able to open earlier than in a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> The *of_six_months*/*six-month* ban on marihuana trade which in all probability will be approved in the next week in the last week of Montrouz put forward consideration the city in the western part of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to turn out in such a position that we shall give to somebody a license, and then it will cause the serious problems at the federal level&quot; -, Bob Nikolson, the member of the urban council speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city has voted against this correction. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Contradiction between results of the local voting and that for what the state has voted also now with us is evident. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Else very many unsolved questions remain. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Uajett: I have been forced out from Oxford for the fact that I am a conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Prosecutions of the students of the universities for their glances have begun not today. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> How much I remember myself, I always dreamt about entering the *Oxford* university. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and the elder brother studied in Oxford and described him as the training institution, best in the world, the modern analog of ancient symposium, laying two fundamentals of a civilization, is free thinking and is tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Nevertheless after two weeks of learning of the historical faculty Vusterskogo of the college of the Oxford university at the end of the eightieth, I have packed the suitcases and have left, which has poured out into the first real scandal in my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father hasn&apos;t withstood and has begun to weep. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> The friends were muddled up. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of The Evening Standard asserted that I had given up a college, because I haven&apos;t liked that my classmates make love in a neighbouring room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer E.. Northman Wilson joked that I had left, because I had to drink from the chippy cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> In fact everything was not so amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I have run down. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes have run down because I was systematically hunted down and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Quite not because of my enough unusual name or the fact that I studied at a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was hunted down only for one cause, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, the now deceased Vudro Uajett, were known adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was the conservatives&apos; partisan. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Will you ask what for to to recollect it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data the new generation of the students, sticking to right-centrist glances, is subject to the the same baiting. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This institutionalized and permanently growing hate for students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that in the last week the group of such students required the same protection of its rights as one who presents himself to the invalids for sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2424"> They want to bring in an additional representative to a committee for equal rights of the college to insure freedom of expression of their opinion. </seg>

<seg id="2431"> &quot;It is threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and just the normal life of the members of the club&quot; -, she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the first several weeks in Oxford not just in minority, I was alone. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered there in September 1986 by the timid and shy of eighteen girl. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Oxford had fever from hate for the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> In a year before it the university by the voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of reduction of the budget allotments for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such an atmosphere it would be comfortless even the Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of freshman week when the students get acquainted with each other and the teachers I for the first time felt that had expected me ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I haven&apos;t known that the teachers not only saw through the fingers baiting of students-conservatives, but with pleasure took in it part oneself yet. </seg>

<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Uajett -, teacher the now late Harry Pitt - has said, please, translate the first paragraph&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text yielded me with difficulty, I stumbled. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was a very bilious person with the face, similar to a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Doesn&apos;t Tetcheristy fundamentally teach to the French, or aren&apos;t - there enough for them just the brains&quot; has he asked.? </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students have chuckled. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> With me the tears on the eyes have appeared. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise on you to take several initial lessons on the French in the free time if you, of course, aren&apos;t occupied revolving in a society - Pitt has grumbled very much&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I have returned to my room of perfectly miserable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> In that evening in a college I sat behind lunch alone; then somebody patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, the student of the second course from a faculty of the English language which has seemed as a member of an Association of the conservatives of the university. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who are you - he has said friendly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> -Regretfully the affair is in a following way: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Over each who is suspected of sympathies to the conservatives, will mock. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is for me myself uneasy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore you will find it more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> The majority of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they are the labourists&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub I cowardly tried to dissemble. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted on the fact that agree not on everything that Margaret Thatcher speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The cunning hasn&apos;t proved possible. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The freshman of the faculty of philosophy, policy and economy which studied itself in Eton has said: &quot;You are the fascist pig&apos;s daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contagious&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have caught up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do the conservatives make love - has one of them Asked.? </seg>
<seg id="2464"> -Do they pound each other true&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so, as, must be, the homosexuals before cancellation of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Shall I be able ever to live normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or shall I have to meet the like-minded persons only under the cover of the night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Shall I be forced to conceal physique lejboristkoj and my real convictions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The forthcoming me three years have begun to seem hell, full of persecutions and solitude. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> Norman, the stone, the professor of modern history were the sole teacher in my college that wasn&apos;t concealing their conservative views. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but for the fact that he was adviser Thatcher on the questions of foreign policy and one of her speechwriters. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He practically didn&apos;t appear in a college. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him provincialism, meanness and adherence to Marxist-deterministic glance at history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he received professorial job at the university Bilkent in Ankara Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you won&apos;t be happy&quot; -, he has told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I have begun to ride to Oxford from a parental house in London trying to find refuge among the kinsmen and the open-minded metropolitan friends. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I have told the father that I hate Oxford and have explained a cause. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He me didn&apos;t come to believe. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During its learning in the forties any political views there were received. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But for it is the best university in the world -, he has said pitifully. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> -There not capable of such only not in the city of the napping spires </seg>

<seg id="2484"> &quot;Don&apos;t make the wrong decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is just the jokes. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You will break me the heart if you throw the university&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was tired out by the constants for the journeys to London and washing emotional protection weakened. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also the conservative, haven&apos;t withstood pressure and have given up their convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> In the next week during the seminar, when the next teacher of history perfectly seriously named me &quot;the enemy of a people&quot; I decided to act as. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In a shower burning shame I have confessed that &quot;the parents have washed for me the brains&quot;, have also named them &quot;the old fools&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Into a lid of the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to nail up the last nail for my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> In that time he wrote each week in two columns for editions, belonging to *Rupert* Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I didn&apos;t go out, and after five minutes my persecutors have given in. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they went away I have packed a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I after all haven&apos;t returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can name me the cry-baby and a rag. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But into eighteen years nobody must become an object of such a fury and intimidations in the training institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> It is in that sadder that it was Oxford which has not only let out the Tory&apos;s, fourteen prime ministers but till this day hides behind an undeserved reputation of the university in which the equality and free thinking are appreciated. </seg>

<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him the month ago on ceremonial supper in Museum Orse. </seg>

<seg id="2554"> &quot;He was impeccable, the time not exists for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If a princess it says </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The heaviest profession is in the world: the miners from Kavakh-Idzhena </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros the Indonesian miners risk life and health bringing in 70 kilograms of sulphur on apex of the volcano over the steep stony paths </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people, for which their work is hell, and other literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Which among them Anto Vidzhajya earn one of the 400 miners for life with extraction of sulphur in volcano Kavakh-Idzhen, situated in the east of Indonesian island Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Each day Anto descends to a most bottom of the crater, where sulphureous gas, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals at contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Hackling the huge pieces of sulphur of which the common weight can equal 70 kilograms he puts them to two bamboo baskets, shoulders the baskets the shoulders and carries them upward along a precipitous stony road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Before apex of the volcano the height of which equals 2.386 metres, only only 250 metres, by the emaciated heavers is however required more than 40 minutes to rise by tortoise step with difficulty retaining equilibrium and cautiously fumbling with a road not to misstep and not fall from breakage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong step can cost them life as it has happened to one tourist from France which fell from rocks Kavakh-Idzhena several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners from Kavakh-Idzhena earn 5 Euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur which is obtained </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Turning out at the top they lay themselves a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were the monkeys from a circus, and, wearily carrying the heavy baskets, three kilometres to the weights, which the mineral resource company has aligned slightly higher, at the height of 1.850 metres march. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The speech suits about PT Kandi Ngrimbi the enterprise which exploits the Indonesian rupees are approximately like 1960 not to also say, this volcano the year is and better its employees to whom it pays 662 (5 Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells him for 10.000 rupees (83 Euro cents), however this mineral to petrochemical productions, is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of the matches, fireworks, *COSMETICS*, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;For norm is portage of 70 kilograms we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) behind each *KHODKA*&quot; -, explain to us Anto, which usually executes three daily portages. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels like broken, however they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems *MIZER* for such a superhuman effort it is three times larger than the fact that it would earn in a floor. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Char pay to the miners is very high by the local measures where 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) in a day are paid for collection of coffee, and the the average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)&quot; -, a heaver explains, which earlier worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There its salary reached 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) in a day, and the area wasn&apos;t so heavy, but Anto has returned with its family in Ban&apos;yuvangi, the small town is not far from a volcano, for the weighty cause which in Indonesia is the the same crushing as sulphur: &quot;YA married a girl with Bali where the Hinduists alone are and have brought her to Java, so that it receives Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> At Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of toxic gas </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Into the 27 years Anto has spent three years risking himself into Kavakh-Idzhene whose sulphur has already begun to tell on it notwithstanding the presence of the mask and the special spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of the toxic gas which a volcano secretes. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price which it must pay for achievement of its dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I shall work two more years, because I want to open a shop or study the Spanish or is French&quot; -, he promises on more than acceptable, English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The pleasant and clever young man, punished with life, this, would be able to be the tourist guide, the waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead of it he does the mule&apos;s work. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Dividing a dirty wooden hut into other porters he rises each day per two hours of night, because sulphur doesn&apos;t stop leaking out over the nights, when its characteristic yellow colour converts into blue and shines among gloom. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Being a challenge to shadows Anto descends to a crater illuminating a road to oneself with a small lantern, which he himself has bought connected with his helmet on the money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters drag the baskets with sulphur on the shoulders from a bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Notwithstanding high profits the mineral resource company didn&apos;t mechanize extraction of sulphur for economy of expenditures and don&apos;t grant any equipment to the porters who work on its bill and with such deprivations. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact they don&apos;t receive even the part from 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) of the collection for photography which together with the input ticket is for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this reserve collect from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and his people-mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for the cattle, and not for the people&quot; -, Badrusin declares, the dumpy porter of 42 years which has spent three decades on Kavakh-Idzhene since has abandoned a college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of raising up to 110 kilograms he assures that he will tolerate work &quot;so much how much will be able&quot; because money on education of its three children at the age from 18 to 10 years is for it necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I shan&apos;t go away on pension, I shall die here, because the volcano is whole my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense posts of smoke, going out from a volcano, they are so strong that not one doesn&apos;t complain about their severe diseases, the obviously, habitual problems, more serious than them, of breath, arthrosis, pains are in the knees and ulcers are on the shoulders which deformed under the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing a basket on the back Unajnik now only can raise 50 kilograms per the 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Each day he and his companions take out 15 tons of sulphur from a volcano which transport three lorries to a magazine into Tamansari overcoming the distance of 18 kilometres over a narrow path among the thickets. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I shan&apos;t go away on pension, I shall die here, because the volcano is whole my life&quot; -, Unajnik declares widely opening the mouth, in which don&apos;t grasp at several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> From his five children, senior, 30 years too work the carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The time passes, but poverty perpetuates from a generation into a generation one of the heaviest studies in the world: one that is dealt the human mules from Kavakh-Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looks for the children to salvage economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singaporeans accuse career, stress and the prices of a dwelling and formation in the children&apos;s absence. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;It is for the population of Singapore necessary to grow&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I the husband the patriot, you are my spouse, the patriot, executable, our civil debt also shall create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It can seem incredible that these lines are the part of advertisement of the mint flat cakes however, notwithstanding it - or perhaps due to it -, by video it has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These sentences are the part of the rap which uses the local sayings it seems &quot;Let put bao (the bun) to an oven&quot; to laugh at the level of birthrate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency which has made this video, BBH cherishes hope that with the help of advertisement they will succeed in attracting attention to a given problem in a recreational form. </seg>

<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried to make much, for example, realize a launching of the spirits with the pheromones or organize the parties of quick acquaintances (the blitz-rendezvous). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas perhaps were creative, but have unobligingly worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Shouldn&apos;t we, have therefore we thought, why *would* make most creative thing from possible, to solve a given problem, namely compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who not perceives it so thoughtlessly is a government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1.300 US dollars in a year on policy for inspiration of the citizens on birth of the *greater* number of children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for married couples and the parents grants up to 15.000 dollars for a child, extends leaves over pregnancy and also provides the kinds with tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of it has low effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is, also the rich and high technology state-city in the South-eastern Asia famous for conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The level of birthrate in Singapore, according to its national administration of the population is at the level of 1,2 children on a woman currently. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time he was below 2 - what is known as percent of replacement - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why so haven&apos;t the Singaporeans the *greater* number of children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> *Tana* Twist Ming, the director of the Section on policy from married couples and the families of the National administration of the population &quot;formation, say that a cause of that, improved&quot;, and &quot;a wider gamma of the career possibilities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It has allowed the people to have a wider scale of the versions in the fact that touch vital aims and priorities besides wedding and creation of a family -, she explains, at one&apos;s disposal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms contribute to growth of the number of bachelors and storage of marriages and the children&apos;s, birth, as a result of which, the level of birthrate in Singapore has gone down. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> In the meantime the immigrational policy which is directed on a considerable increase of immigration for confrontation with reduction of the population causes perturbation among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> There in Singapore are websites where the hardly concealed xenophobia with respect to many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintenance of salaries at the low level and unwillingness to be integrated prospers. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the causes of the fact that in the last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in an election since times of independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> There was attempt to solve a problem, with the help of quotes and more than high taxes for the foreign workers after the election. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall of birthrate has known influence on the economic height of the nation, tax-entering, of expenses for medicine and policy of immigration the example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government makes the efforts, so that so much small dwelling doesn&apos;t fall in. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example this beginning to influence a sector of a real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The manual of urban development has passed to the control of the number of the small apartments, known as &quot;the footwear box&quot;, is to which possible build in the definite districts of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments of the area of 46 square metres very well sell themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> There nevertheless is opinion that they can contribute to an idle lifestyle and deprive the developers who want to build the large family dwelling of a stimulus. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lima YU. Put, general director of the house building, the companies EL Developers, says that their &quot;footwear boxes&quot; much quicker than the more spacious specimens sell themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular in that sense, which such apartments will be snapped up several days even weeks quicker than an apartment of *greater* size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As its result, our money-entering increases. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless he recognizes that new norms give the clearer orientators for the developers in whom earlier obstacles placed if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too overstrained </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is the city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules can be step in a direction of an increase of national birthrate, after a talk with the Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center it seems that they won&apos;t have special effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are overstrained very much, the dwelling is expensive also as also the formation, and because of it many people put - it aside&quot;, a young manager speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have the children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But it is important for me to have the own money and the time - at one&apos;s disposal&quot;, the other young man of 20 years speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The men and the women mention their career, stress and the prices of a dwelling and formation as the causes which hamper them in acquiring the children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So however the government tried to impel its citizens to the children&apos;s birth in what concerns childbearing the last word remains to get the Singaporeans. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Personal in the off-line mode - personal in the on-line mode </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to a dictionary of the Royal academy of the Spanish language the matter concerns about the property of quotient or &quot;a sphere of the personal life which have right to protect against any intervention&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is personal for a minor more junior than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How does he use this definition in his everyday life and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Does he understand the dangers to which is subjected in discussion on the Internet of the situations which by all means wouldn&apos;t share beyond the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> elPeriodico have given an interview to five children from ten to 15 years, the frequent users of network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases they associated a term &quot;with something very &quot;by my&quot; for a personal plane, both password and the user&apos;s, name&quot; when was used he to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I wouldn&apos;t load my biggest secrets during fasting&quot; -, speak, Khorkhe, is when try to explain the value of personal on such sites as Facebook, twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has the registration recordings the ten-year already two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;It is the very secret secrets, my mom can know them but are not the whole world&quot; -, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> FB I load the beautiful pictures or the pictures from the games on. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Also I disport myself with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I wouldn&apos;t share the photograph which is not my, or of anybody who behaves foolishly&quot; -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy realizes that it is bad to publish the indecent photographs of the naked people of crimes or write insulting or furious comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Khorkhe assures that 35 friends, nine know, which he has in FB, and the folloverov in twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Their majority are the kinsmen. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Mother in course she has a password to one of the registration recordings. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I have acquired twitter to express myself and write interesting tvity. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know, one corresponds to me, I load - only them&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertainment, I can speak with the distant kinsmen or their quick - friends&quot;, he indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Not conceiving answer that have never will accepted a query of the unfamiliar face. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Wouldn&apos;t *WOULD* reckon with anybody who would recommend him to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of 14 year-old Jose differs. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> This teenager has the open registration recordings on Hotmail of Facebook My Space and Ask, and in the last recognize that 20 people, added into the friends&apos; his list, don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It doesn&apos;t frighten me, because we have anything common, music, for example&quot; -, he indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the words of the boy nobody to it shuffled in confidence and didn&apos;t ask his domestic address or the number of telephone. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;I if I come to be pressed or require just shall remove them from my registration recording&quot; -, he recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose has become follower Ask after reading of recommendation to twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Experiment in the fact that how today is known to kibermobbing is not alien to a boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> My friend&apos;s one acquaintance was blackmailed on social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> One threatened to him and extorted money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He after all hasn&apos;t found out who really was&quot; - he assures. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim according to the words of Jose hasn&apos;t removed the registration recording. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;Have only included confidentiality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains the sequence of steps in a way, safe for tuning of the registration recording. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Khorkhe this boy would load the photographs of the acquaintances in the uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes I would make it if the person doesn&apos;t please me or if I want it. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that I am it kibermobbing&quot; -, he confirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Mar&apos;elos Porras the teacher of the English and a specialist in formation and an instruction, believe that to direct the children and the teenagers, it is necessary to understand that aim of social networks - inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has appeared as means for search for information, but with appearance of these sites the rules of a game, - have varied&quot;, she notes. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> The, Porras specifies that academician Marc Prenski, the expert on pedagogy from the Yale university and the author of labour Digital natives and the immigrants, has invented these terms for explanation of a given phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives it them, the children and the youth who were born in an epoch of technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants who have to teach to them, while we else study - ourselves&quot;, she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explain that this theme is complicated, &quot;because we ask them to have definite criterion for the fact that it is possible or one may not spread, publish or say at age, when there isn&apos;t enough maturity it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also that they were selective, while it is the most important of all for them to be popular, have thousands of friends not thinking about consequences&quot; -, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the words of the specialist to speculate their the most effective mode which make such show that confidentiality the children and the teenagers, - to ask the questions is. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them that they didn&apos;t make it is useless&quot; -, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Does Porras then list any versions: are there things which you wouldn&apos;t tell the stranger, why do you so make it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, would you like if photography had been published you like one that have published you about your friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that other publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When do you sign the photographs from the parties, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And to one, more know, is for all necessary, what do you do at each moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> One more point - it allow them understand that they must behave the on-line mode as as is made, it is the off-line mode. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are alone and are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Beyond the Internet the person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as has to be on social networks&quot; -, she asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardiya the university the teacher, the professor of the initial education and a counselor over formation, the necessity of the fact that the heads of the families conscientiously read explains, of policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding each of the points they have good reasons of the talks with the children about the prerequisites of opening of the registration recording on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and the fact that it is permitted to spread or publish&quot; -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Gaurdiya agrees, &quot;don&apos;t say the key question - to remind the children of a lesson with the strangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit UNASUR ends without promulgation Limskoj of a declaration </seg>

<seg id="2743"> He protected in this context the project of an establishment of the south American citizenship of which the countries-participants UNASUR approve. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to attain free movement of the citizens and working over any south American country, how it already happens to the members of the Andes community, but there hitherto are reactionary sectors which want to return us to the past&quot; - he has warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian president has revealed himself besides that by the partisan of a resumption of an Organization of the American states (*OAS*) under a prerequisite of decrease in influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and acceptance into attention of ones who have signed a Pact of San Jose of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Ones who give talks never take on no obligations on themselves, and we, the south Americans, conversely, sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;Inexplicably what inter-American the commission for human rights will walk enough in Washington also is financed by the United States&quot; -, he has declared hinting at political refuge, given by Ecuador to founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Korrea has assured that don&apos;t regret this solution, because with it he didn&apos;t betray the principles, but observed the &quot;deep values of democracy and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He has added that &quot;there were definite suspicions of the fact that Assange will be extradited to the third country, and a process won&apos;t be observed&quot; in his time. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He has criticized besides that, the Swedish justice is for a requirement to come to its territory for interrogation concerning supposed crime while there is &quot;the Swedish legislation itself on the sexual soil, believe possible to realize him by, to make with the embassy of Ecuador in London was of which is for the video conference possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Korrea has confirmed that risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange exists. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Me not said from by him since he has come to our embassy, but, the ambassador has reported to me that at him, a small pulmonary problem, the Ecuadorian head of the state has said, was, nothing serious&quot; -. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What indeed is is danger of deterioration of its physical and mental health because of incarceration in small space without a possibility to do exercises on air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It influences any person&apos;s - health&quot;, he has added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Korrea has specified that a solution of the problem of refuge, granted to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by allocation of a guarantee of the inviolability which will allow him to go to Ecuador, are in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs and have emphasized that negotiations in London on search for a solution of the problem of incarceration of the founder WikiLeaks were. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We don&apos;t conduct negotiations on human rights, we don&apos;t use this word for a given case, but permanent discussions were. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution of this problem is found in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs, because the lawyer of Assange, Bal&apos;tasar *GARSON* leads a series of the processes in the different European instances&quot; - he has mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And have expressed opinion that &quot;if Great Britain tomorrow gives a guarantee of inviolability it will end&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Also if how Sweden her beautifully allows her legislation, and how she has already made in other cases, will interrogate seigneur Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate him Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Korrea has used a case to reveal oneself as a defender of print freedom and has emphasized that don&apos;t tolerate &quot;a mediocrity, the unconscientiousness and lie which distorts freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The main enemies of print freedom, he has said it is not the perverse villains-politicians, but are the bad journalists, supporting profit, blackmail and extortion&quot; -. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> He has remained glad that more narrowly neither these journalists &quot;nor are the bankers, nor the bourgeois countries-hegemons don&apos;t reign in Ecuador&quot; from this aspect and has added that being reelected &quot;will deepen a revolution for continuation of development in a true direction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Korrea has also supported a decision to keep veto of Paraguay into UNASUR at least before the next election substantiating it with the fact that an organization &quot;have to be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a support of upheavals under a mask of legality&quot;, because in reality &quot;it has destroyed legality of Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian president has believed besides that &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot; a wish of his Columbian colleague of Juan Manuel Santosa to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the sea borders between two countries after the solution of the International court of justice of the Hague which has turned out in favour to Nicaraguan sea sovereignty now. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For a given moment this solution isn&apos;t observed. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between the south American and the central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome by the wish to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and continue to move ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Also he has voiced hope for good termination of the argument on the sea boundaries which is held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and has voiced, which &quot;is correct for the Latin America to appeal to the international instances if two countries pledge to make a decision however heavy it was&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Concerning a possibility to act as as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run on the third term in succession, he has indicated that he considers this possibility &quot;with large optimism and joy, although occasionally it is enough heavy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Korrea has assured that if lose in an election in February 2013 then will give public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> In a personal plan I have been never interested in the power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social-economic poverty can be corrected only on the part of the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement has believed that just I guaranteed this probable victory, so that one has to recognize this responsibility&quot; -, he has said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In a case of a victory it would become my last term in the president&apos;s job, and then we go out from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If the same loses. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> He has confirmed &quot;this solution&quot; -. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Korrea has also mentioned new course for treatment of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> The mortality from AIDS today - the result of late diagnostic </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabritsio was 21 years, when it was announced that its analysis on AIDS had given positive result to it. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I like have been deafened&quot; -, he recollects, one is difficult notwithstanding the doctor&apos;s whole tact, the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young boy has concealed it from its family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Deciding to cope with a disease independently he has wanted to find out her how possible more And his efforts has come - true he has already observed his 43th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabritsio - one of the &quot;oldest&quot; patients of HIV-separation of hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) where he has got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lived with a diagnosis &quot;virus of immunodeficiency of the person&quot; (HIV) already 22 years are At the beginning of the 90th years into it would be complicated come - to believe too few then existed versions of treatment, too few things were known of a disease, too in a bias treated the patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even the so director of a clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection hasn&apos;t wanted to say goodbye to it, &quot;because he had a cut&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words in those times to have AIDS was a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It now is possible to survive at this syndrome and make it not aggravating the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless not knowing of their disease hitherto many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;has exhausted&quot; their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> &quot;The fact that the survival of the patient who begins treatment in time, and the survival of the common population in precision are similar -, the head of the HIV section HCG Khajme Andrade Vil&apos;yanueva has indicated refering to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in prestigious scientific edition, with 31 years after appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases is great achievement for a given moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infection disease doctor and an expert on HIV an AIDS, Andrade Vil&apos;yanueva has explained that since 2008 the scientists have come, to a conclusion that AIDS isn&apos;t a verdict, however the duration and the quality of life depend on the degree of defeat of the immune system, available at the patients, at the beginning of diagnostic, with the best expected duration of life with ones who don&apos;t use the drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and before 50 summers when is reported about 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> More simply speaking, aforesaid mean, which the the one who receives a diagnosis HIV-of positive is at age is 25 years old according to these terms &quot;supporting the control will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years&quot; -, he has explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To estimate this progress it is necessary to recollect that the duration of the Mexicans&apos; life today on the average are 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality significantly went down in the last years in a case of Mexico the number of people, dying from AIDS, went down from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in the year 2011 (the yearly report YUNEJDS), also the fact that from a moment of appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database have died is also true. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Khalisko 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths to May of this year; already are registered, nevertheless, is established, which is universal access to antiretrovirusnym preparations since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> -Why hitherto are there lethal outcomes? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> -It seems that a problem not in access to treatment personally to me. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I imagine it, the affairs in our hospital are so. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> We hadn&apos;t the at least last 12 years a shortage in the medicaments, the problem is in the fact that the patients come very late, because isn&apos;t known of our infected state i.e. at the late stages of a disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He has given crushing data: &quot;Nine of the ten patients come, when have some opportunistic infection; already, which is necessary on to conduct diagnostic to grant is for to have *greater* influence mortality, to to make, common so is it are the tests detection is in the mass scale, for all people, who will ask it, more than early stages, and therefore necessary&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In their offer converge to opinion the specialists and the officials of the State council for prevention of AIDS into Khalisko (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, by only the like Fabritsio which has appealed to the private laboratory for a checkup impelled fact that it has made his friend, and, notwithstanding its young age, it has already been at the stage of AIDS, also even suffered from sarcoma Kaposhi, the cancerous tumor which is one of the widespread complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes, when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that will die, and don&apos;t want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;I, the time all the same shall die, I shall load up better three times per week&quot; - say they But we not in wash a case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I well feed, I do exercises, I receive the medications. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> For today, his parents only know, that he has transfered of the feretories. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live normal life as any is other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work in me hard studies, I journey, I lead active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care about myself and the other person&quot;, - Fabritsio, has listed which has agreed share by my personal life from MILENIO JALISCO that spodvignut&apos; my declaration of ones who now, in a context of World day of struggle with AIDS feel fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let ????? be tested if risk was, with infections, although is how possible rather found, out whether they are HIV-positive, so feels better, and if they have a diagnosis, although it is found out that can live as any other person being responsible already. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Its this message summarizes a theme of struggle against AIDS in this year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The condoms are behind a counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> The precipices between the programmes in the domain of health protection and a simple citizen, the, Ricardo Salazar, believes, journalist from Guadalajara who has started to deal with a problem, connected with HIV, are large. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And it is the largest prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the places, dedicated to this task, &quot;the dissemination of the condoms in fact increased, earlier to us gave, one or two, now us allow the packages over hundred, and it is very good, but it turns out that to eat ones who now hitherto haven&apos;t access to a condom&quot; -, he has said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Do you need them what for&quot; popular the question, with jeering and condemnation, on the part of the social employees, the school counselors, the employees of the drugstores and the employees of health protection which not the teenagers want to hear have certified is the propagandist it.? </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms were not only behind the counters and that their hundred was in the automata in the public toilets in the places which often the youth attends. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not the encouragement of profligacy. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The matter doesn&apos;t concern about payment for beer and a motel, governor Emilio Gonzalez, has answered whether when it was asked distribution of the condoms with its leadership is possible. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It is not the sexuality, it is the best of all to make the condoms accessible to ones who practise sexual activity -, he has noted, already&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data are in Khalisko </seg>
<seg id="2824"> The 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) are registered. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state occupies the 4th place in national rating on the new and total occasions of AIDS and the 13th over HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92 % of infections relate to a sexual way, 6 % across the blood and 2 % to a perinatal way. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> By estimations, 50 thousand people can live from HIV, for for one registered case from 4 to 5 people which don&apos;t know of it are. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Taking ratification by the appellate court of the United States of a solution into account which annuls restructurization of debt of the Group of Vitro, reached by competitive production in Mexico, the script sets fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country which has the problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures in a support of survival of the companies which are permitted by Mexican laws aren&apos;t actual in a country of the bands and the stars, in contradiction with the international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In a practical sphere approval of a decision, made on 15 June by judge Kharlin Hale in a court of bankruptcies of the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican companies in front of a possibility of an imposition of an arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However the decree opens the doors for the leading producer of a glass in Mexico for appeal to the Supreme court of the United States leading three mismatches into a proof. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> As entry, while the judge of an affair notes that the creditors must be adjusted by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy the Appellate court of the fifth district, situated in the New Orleans, says that the basic trial concerns competitive production, considered in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point means cancellation of international judicial cooperation in the cases of insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact Type law of the UN over a unification of right of international trade with this aim was created defining as a referee the American institute of right. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly the verdict establishes that without an intercompany voting, restructurizations the indebtednesses, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production, which had in front of a maternal company branches Vitro, majority, necessary for assertion, weren&apos;t reached are. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mexican laws nevertheless recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact Vitro wasn&apos;t the first case, when this scheme is received. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Half a dozen of examples is among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose intercompany debts the Federal institute of competitive productions guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is true, also also the fact that subtracting the voices of branches, it is anyway is the creditors Vitro who struggled against him in the courts of the United States namely the funds &quot;the vultures&quot; like Aurelios Capital Aurelios Convergencia Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, wouldn&apos;t reach majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The voting would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The Appellate court omits these data. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand he accuses Vitro in the complicated situation with which the one has collided beginning since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis which has overtaken the United States delivering the blows at a country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> As long as what the company of the family Gonzalez of the Garden shows, the appeal against a solution into is the appellate court, itself that the voting has reached his plenum, i.e., five judges in view of the fact that only three have been voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In a case of a failure the intercession for the certificate which will require revision of a process on the part of the court of the supreme instance, in a given case of the Supreme court of the United States will be shown. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worst of all the fact that the court has rejected a document, directed by the government of Mexico in a role amicus curiae (&quot;the friend of a court&quot;) in which the process which should Vitro within the framework of Law of competitive productions, signaling the fact that he releases itself from observance of the agreements, signed by both countries to connect with an article of Law 15 of the USA of bankruptcy, is described, she. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> It besides that is noted that the country has been subordinated to the principles of the Commission of the Organization of the Combined Nations for international trade, i.e., the rules, introduced for the cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;of Khetin&quot; Rejes: &quot;the Basketball was my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Inveterate basketball traveller Hector &quot;of Khetin&quot; Rejes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, due to it, has maneged the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico bear so many basketball stories, as Hector &quot;of Khetin&quot; Rejes in the memory. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And however before than the haemorrhage from the brain has enchained him to an invalid carriage in 2008, Rejes was immersed into sport during more than 60 years, as a player small categories, the player the Supreme basketball league, the representative and the leader BSN and Cowboys Bayamona and the president of a Federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I executed many roles in basketball over a distance of my life, including somewhat simultaneously how when I was president BSN, the general director of the National team and the president of a federation in the 90th years&quot; -, Rejes during a visit of Primera Hora to him recollects home where in Bayamon he lives in my faithful spouse from Isabel&apos;, over a distance more of 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;The basketball was my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Rejes doesn&apos;t exaggerate making this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Walls of its house almost all, decorated with the photographs and the memorable things, gathered behind its long way, testify to it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamon in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the greatest emotions he stores that which remember his way across the Cowboys beginning with the middle of the 50th years as a player before the year, 1982 when accomplished 15 years of his departure into the roles from-an agent or an agent of a contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years which I enjoyed most of all, because had a possibility to be the part of the eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, from-an agent or a leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Five championships that have passed approximately 1971 were many years of joy, including till 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And afterwards I said goodbye to one in the year, 1981 per year of debut of Jerome Minsi into BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From that moment also henceforth to lead has begun &quot;Kuko&quot; Ortis, which was the great manager&quot; -, Rejes has specified. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Ginas *Bart* which started here and was, at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), have told me: &quot;I for you have a very strong player in growth 6&apos; 7&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Do you want&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And it was Minsi beginning one of the best players whom Puerto Rico had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Then recommended *Bart*, sniper Raymond Gaussa, who has received citizenship has also become one of our best bombardiers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Me I remember that have said that if Minsi has brought championship Bayamonu has helped to conquer Gauss one more. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> I have enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys and Gauss, but already at distance, because by 1988 have already appeared the head of a federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> To that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements of Minsi in a national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember, as we have won for the first time from the USA during an olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then the world Championship of the year, 1990 on which we have received the fourth place and came, it had to be bronze if *would*, not that Canadian judge, who has made us outplay a final game, Rejes has said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> That command from the world Championship of 1990 is the best picked team which you have ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> What she among best as also one has won from Dream Team on the Olympic games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But one, was, which from the Pan-American games at Cuba in 1991 when we won, my favourite, gold has also broken the national team of the USA which was enough similar to one who has won bronze in world championship from us. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In that command Minsi not only again played Gauss, *Ramon* Rivasa Fiko Lopez and&apos; Pikulina&apos; (Ortisa), but, whom also young (Xavier)&apos; Ton&apos;ito&apos; Colon and James Karter, brothers Leon (Fransisko and Edgar) and Mario&apos; Kikhote&apos; Morales couldn&apos;t participate in the year 90 because of injury of the knee. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The command which perhaps, was not the best in a plan of personal composition, but Argentina has brought us a golden medal and great joy, was a command of the Olympic qualifying tournament of the year 1995 in Neukene. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With the role players like&apos; Kanito&apos; N&apos;evesa of Pablo Alisea also of young Rolando Khurruitnera instead of the players, temporarily pushed aside disorder of the Pan-American championship, *Mar_del_Plata*, we have won gold despite all forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Pikulin Ortis was without versatile doubts this. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its indexes on the international tournaments impress. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody dominated in Puerto Rico at this level so, as Pikulin made it. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And without a registration it is its careers in the different leagues in which it played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is a very complicated question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had very good young, including *Julio* Toro, the Flora Melendesa Carlos Moralesa, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torresa. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The work of Leo Arilly from young pleases me very much. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you believe your main achievement in a federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation is in the most glorious epoch of national team between the 1988 and 1995 years, and what at the beginning of the 90th years in BSN was before 17 commands in season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What has had you to make? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> The things which I wanted to realize were, for example *REGIONALIZATSIYa* of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example that the boys from Ponse played only in their region and only against the commands from other parts of the island there is playoff in national. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the children journey and play too much, and it is excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruits of obligatory certification and course for the managers, the officials and the judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It delivers pleasure to me. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you now do? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, I see musical videos of my epoch on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go from time to time on the basketball matches. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, I, of course, enjoy a society of my spouse Icabel&apos; who always was with me. </seg>
