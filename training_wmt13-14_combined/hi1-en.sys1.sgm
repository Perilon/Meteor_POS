<seg id="570"> Scientists have already made on the subject and that the dog&apos;s tail with his antics and mood of what&apos;s in between. </seg>
<seg id="571"> The last reported that according to the dog&apos;s tail is happy with his point of view on the right are more than via (kutatē if you talk about his dog&apos;s tail, while the more you shake mainly on the left side. </seg>
<seg id="572"> But now, scientists say that this subtle distinction in his dog&apos;s tail can recognize and can express its response. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The study has been published in the current journal bāyalōjī. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Neuroscientist, professor at the University of Georgia ṭarēṇṭō vēlalaraṭigarā from Steven reported: &quot;Men are very well known and this is all in the mind of the part of left and right are different from that in the excitement, which include generating positive or negative emotions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Here we see it also in other species is attempted. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Dogs, like humans, said that even in the right part of the brain and the antics of his left hand he was responsible for the opposite order, and two different roles in gōlāradadhōṁ has feelings. </seg>
<seg id="577"> To learn more about this by other dogs for the single that dog react with each other on how to move the tail, would see films of dogs has on other animals. </seg>
<seg id="578"> He measured the heart of itall of domestic dogs and analysis of their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="579"> We understand their tail is probably not more than ever why the shaking on the one hand at other times. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Professor Steven reported: &quot;The dogs we vēlalaraṭigarā films of dogs, presented with the realistic - in uljhan version or to deal with other issues affecting chāyā-citara, and we could see the action of the tail and the tail can be more in the left or right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="581"> When the animals are caused by the dog&apos;s stolid (kutatē (in terms of their tail as a right, they have seen you shake so freely. </seg>
<seg id="582"> But when he changed direction to the tail (mainly on the left side looked like a dog (in terms of their rate of heart beat and they talk about is increased. </seg>
<seg id="583"> According to Professor vēlalaraṭigarā they didn&apos;t think through the antics of these dogs are not to communicate with each other. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Instead, they think that dog has learnt this from my own experience, which is that he should be concerned about the action and not on how. </seg>
<seg id="585"> He said: &quot;If you go to other dogs, and there are many times when they&apos;re on their tail as if you are one of the good far more, with less, and is related to the right part offers good behaviour, you react with each other on the basis of the same experience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Researchers say that these conclusions, the team of animal owners and trainers about the feelings of animals can provide better information. </seg>
<seg id="587"> The University of Bristol&apos;s School of vēṭaranērī fellow guest of the Sciences, a specialist on the behaviour of dogs, John barēḍaśō said that this is the first study to check that the dog is not important part for the left or the right or not. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Last year at the University of Lincoln&apos;s team found was that when they see a dog&apos;s aggressive dog left his head like a dog and are happy to see his head on the right are like. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, in contrast to the study a-mitalian batāyā: he &quot;- This robot dog&apos;s tail hilā&apos;ī than right on the left side of the dog, but instead of getting close to the mark was more likely to get&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="590"> He said that the differences in the studies was so different from his animals in films or not fully understand श्वान dog robot. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He explained that the reaction of a real dog by dogs it&apos;s methods can help study. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;There is enough evidence from different mammals are the two parts of the brain that&apos;s used for different purposes, to get more details and is also yet to come - and in this case, the dog is no exception&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, easily the behavior which can be recorded, and we have to understand that their tail is probably not more than ever why the shaking on the one hand at other times. </seg>

<seg id="1769"> The plan to create a federal Europe is always of the same domestic opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> But, the current economic crisis has proved the radical parivaratanakāraka. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> Berlin and the European Central Bank followed by strict rules, with the currency through the practice of national economies because of obstacles has been installed on many people, is also to think that the European project is a distant place. </seg>

<seg id="1775"> Is the only way the salaries and reducing public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> On budget and currency problems is further than from deep European productivity points. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Consumers at the expense of French and German energy allows firms to provide - has been installed by Brussels &quot;green&quot; energy policy as a result, European industry compared to the United Nations for electricity and gas to four times for double payments. </seg>

<seg id="1795"> Or we can protect its own economic interests - including the Brussels and Berlin are at the right time to tell for separation is included. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> I think that&apos;s a better Scotland as a member in the European system is loose, provided that we can keep their own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> The same thinking gaira-saṅghīya of other countries in Europe with the United Nations will make it easier for work. </seg>
