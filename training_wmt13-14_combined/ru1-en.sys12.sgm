<seg id="166"> The producers of jet aircraft bind over seat width, when large orders is at stake </seg>
<seg id="167"> Among the leading aircraft manufacturers inflamed fierce debate about the width of seats tourist class on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation on Dubai aviation exhibition in this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute moves around the width of seats, provided the economy class passengers on long-haul flights, whose interests are not always in the spotlight airlines, with the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS offered and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard, which included the seats at least 18 inches wide (46 cm) in salons economy, but its main American rival Boeing says it must deal with the airline. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in all sales of larger versions of its bimotor long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The rear of the plane - especially the arrangement, whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of new projects &quot;miniaerobusov.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing says its new 777 will accommodate 406 people, on the basis of seats in Economy Class of more than 17 inches in width placed to 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says that competing version of its 350 will be transported in online 350 people on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> But now Airbus appeals directly to the public before airshow in Dubai, where the 777, is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing a slide depicting three people in a restaurant financiers, pressed to each other, called &quot;you would agree to this?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> &quot;Boeing is offering long-haul flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With the change in the diet, people are gaining weight, but aircraft equipment seat has not changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 shirocofuselagny asked the standards of modern long-distance travel, and international century the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The average American male waist girth of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the health service in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called &quot;reactive audience,&quot; was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus says that commissioned the study, testifying that extra inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputes Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> According to her, studies show that interior convenience depends not only on seat width. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;all really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do that, in their view, they have to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing specialist on Kent Craver saloon. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want us to decide for them, that they would bring a profit. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> The issue is to increase space for passengers on the sides, but for suppliers, it is increasingly becoming a factor, which can affect profits. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, at least in the $700 billion for catalogs prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of US and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As Reuters agency reported in July for the first time, the location of seats is precisely what fuels rivalries in the battle between the latest state aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20percent increasing profitability at one place in their latest bimotor long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365mestnsm Boeing both. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Announced the characteristics of Boeing 777 are partly based on a comparison of 10set rows with the original 9mestnoy layout of 777 constructive solutions. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The win in the share price declines when compared with 10set layout used in real time. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;the reason that Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive compared with our developments,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of the department of passenger comfort Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say salons with full 10set rows for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense to be made on seating arrangements, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to the threat from the 777s model,&quot; said an expert on the interior cabin Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing did not supply the chair, but offers a directory of suppliers, from which the airline can choose. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Travelling the world sellers jets even blocking a roulette wheel to check rival planning. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Commending comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus 350 with 10set offers rows, but says she still does not sell it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a wider space aisle on some of their planes. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Without the support of the only other maker of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard hardly&quot; will jump,&quot; but may divert attention from a wave of sales of the 777 model. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Oleynikov: A third of rural settlements in the Moscow region fully donation </seg>

<seg id="225"> After the 1992 truce, it has become an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again ECB to full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents. </seg>

<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog is related to her mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies have shown that pleased with dogs vilyat3 tail in the right side, from the point of view of the dog, while alarmed dogs pomahivat3 tail mainly in the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that other members of the canid family may notice these subtle differences in willing tail and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from Trent University, said: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in shaping stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="362"> We tried to look at this and that of other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that the same way in humans, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how dogs react to sophisticated piling tails other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of heart animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Perhaps soon we understand why their tails sometimes are sent to one side, and sometimes - to another </seg>
<seg id="367"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the video with dogs - dogs or naturalistic version, or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="368"> When the animals have seen that in other respects nothing conveyed the dog was the tail to the right, from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noticed that the tail tended mostly left (again from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), their heartbeat ucate and they looked alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said he doesn&apos;t think that dogs is deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what is not. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He notes: &quot;If there is a few meetings with other dogs and often vile their tail in one direction is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and dressers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions. </seg>
<seg id="374"> An expert in the field of the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, invited researcher in Bristol University veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to test of whether the value for dogs have left and right hand. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln&apos;s discovered that dogs turn your head to the left, to look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if look at devil dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada he reported: &quot;dogs often approached sobacerobotu, when its tail vile program to the left, and not to the right, instead become alarmed, is the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in various research does not fully perceived animals in films or sobacrobotov as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Could be a useful study how dogs react to this dog, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;while on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be specified, and dogs is no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior, probably soon we understand why their tails sometimes are sent to one side, and sometimes - to another. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Is Europe&apos;s elite ready to do business with England? </seg>
<seg id="382"> The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="383"> To this end we have ordered the largest and most complete a survey of British leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 of business leaders, representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sector and region. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The findings of the survey will surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with particular attention to countries that hold the modernization and grow, while the EU countries to stagnate. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They want the government has given priority new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spent time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions confusing. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws on products, the majority of business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Attended the general discontent of the single market, with business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in Europe&apos;s trade zone,&quot; agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European configured from all companies. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The last and most revealing - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom has pursued a course for a change of the treaty and on relations with the EU based on trade, not politics. </seg>

<seg id="463"> Russia out of struggle for urban pollution cars </seg>
<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve transportation problems of major cities observed in most of the world&apos;s megacities starting from the second half of the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expanding highways, or about trying to reduce demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Widely known example of Singapore, where introduced strict quota increase the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them will be bought at auction. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Its price is two to three times higher than the price of the car itself. </seg>
<seg id="468"> European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called green zone, where entry is allowed only cars with certain eclass that use the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars). </seg>
<seg id="470"> Beijing&apos;s environmental protection agency, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;clean air five-year plan&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (around $40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> As director of the traffic pollution control department told Kommersant municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the Plan - the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the growth in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase in no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="472"> According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% overall air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Among the main measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Among other things, the city&apos;s &quot;Green Plan&quot; measures include accelerated transition to corporate fuel compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of the local system standards and marking cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (, moreover, the creation of a financial incentive programs to replace old vehicles to hybrid or electric cars, the development of the electric (including public and official), development of public transport, including high-speed). </seg>

<seg id="476"> According to the State Environmental Protection for 20122020,&quot; the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 them was 138). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to the Environmental Ministry, in 2011 to &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere of cities. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars in ten times industrial, and in St. Petersburg - in nine times. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In the Russian Federation until just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport HSE policy Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for road trip, is patently unpopular, they can be taken by the company only provided their sheer versatility. </seg>
<seg id="481"> In the case of Moscow is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - business and personal cars, as well as cars &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of which is at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total number of Moscow&apos;s fleet). </seg>
<seg id="482"> The other day urbanists prepared the study of ECOM centre in St. Petersburg, where the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, with an area of pavement and the number of vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The main findings of researchers, the center of the city secured roads in two times less than required, and most motorists, who live in the center, not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parking or simply on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The result is invited to build the repository and not parking cars, not expand, and cut out of the snow, with a view to the streets became more friendly to pedestrians, as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the security zone of the historic centre (total territory about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Higher prices for fuel would tax maneuver, which provides for increased tax on mining (MET) simultaneously with the decline in export duties on oil and an increase in excise taxes. </seg>

<seg id="487"> The trip on dirt, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care </seg>
<seg id="488"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Belle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> In this West African country doctors not so much - just one in 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="491"> Vote here or through your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="492"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes CNN 2013. </seg>

<seg id="494"> This person will receive $250,000 to continue its remarkable work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Over the past 21 years Georges Bwelle saw his father returned to life and would once again in an unconscious state, wandering for hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Jammeh Belle was injured in a car crash in 1981, not far from Yaounde, Cameroon&apos;s capital. </seg>
<seg id="497"> At first he had just broken hand, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded about himself to the end of his life. </seg>
<seg id="498"> There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="502"> &quot;You can go out of the house at 5 a.m., pribate in hospital, to be the first, but you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Patients are very much. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation is not much has changed since then, as Belle&apos;s father died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> By comparison, the ratio is one doctor for 413 people in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if Cameron could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of spending on health care in it are private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="511"> &quot;And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy your life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the suffering of his father and a great many of his compatriots, Belle became determined to do something with this. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He himself has become a doctor and vascular surgeon works in Yaounde Central Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="515"> He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008 he and his band of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday he and up to 30 more people nabius in vans, privyazyvaty3 to roofs medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit villages in need of help. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Not always accompanies them luck. </seg>
<seg id="519"> More than once they had to push the car through the river and mud. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they come, they face, as the real heroes: This holiday with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning, the brigade is beginning to take hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We accept 500 people on each trip,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come from all over the landscape within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted infections. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others may get scratches, donated points or free birth certificates - the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evening, the brigade has a simple operation under local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> The operation, as a rule, are held in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone, to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This is unsustainable pace, but determination brigade usually help maintain village musicians. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of his work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> The group, consisting of doctors and foreign Cameron for medical students, spent 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance could have huge implications for those they help. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One man explained that they received free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;It will change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to this clinical methods on weekends and working in a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="538"> It is this second work, he said, provides 60 percent of funding his nonprofit organizations; the remaining funds covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I don&apos;t even know when he sleeps,&quot; said Kathy On &apos;Melli, a student of the second course Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Belle group. </seg>
<seg id="540"> He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization, so that you can continue to these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For the future of doctors and nurses, such as On &apos;Melli, coming from the United States and Europe, to join Belle in the implementation of its tasks is to practice, they would never have received at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We got to these individuals on operations, where we helped to remove blood stains or keep Belle tools for doctors,&quot; said On &apos;Melli. </seg>
<seg id="543"> As studentomvtorocursnikom, you would never have received such a possibility in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> American usually pay their fare themselves in Cameroon, often arriving with pogertvovanmi medication. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on arrival in Yaounde them food, transport and education pays Belle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;On &apos;Melli hero, without a doubt,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="547"> He gives his life of this organization, and his desire to help people Cameroon indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Belle almost constant work load is not a severe test. </seg>
<seg id="549"> To help others to live a happy life, his father to fulfill this promise is what brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I am so happy when doing this work,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees what I do. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I&apos;m doing this, to make people laugh, to reduce their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Go to the website ASCOVIME and see what you can help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> For the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States finally has a new name - &quot;brotherly circle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> This week the black list of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America has been updated with new names and four companies. </seg>

<seg id="569"> Yet Mr. galeotti notes that some personality and have no relationship to Usoyan. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In his opinion, all of them spent more general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Meanwhile the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the &quot;brotherly circle&quot; Grigori Leps - Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s favorite singer - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Of course, we hope that we will get more detailed information from our American collegpartnerov, in connection with what the decision was made, why it in such lists made, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the head of state. </seg>
<seg id="573"> In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation. </seg>

<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> It is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and major layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> The last time he completely driven by consumption, which almost does not ease up speed,&quot; said chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens only, presenting a quarterly report of Investbank yesterday on the Russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With inflation at 6% he can ensure future consumer demand around the current level, expect at Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the profitability of Russian companies falls, however, most likely, they will optimize staff costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we see significant growth of the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, that is only 2% of GDP, explained Mr. only. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Companies faced with declining profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If she didn&apos;t grow up, this could lead to dismissals and a rise in unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Not to raise the salaries of Russian business cannot, said Vladimir Pantyushin chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers is high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To attract employees from the side or keep current, employers have to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia poder of give and very rapid growth potrebcreditovania. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. only because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country does not have this kind of lending. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;good for the economy from potrebcreditovania growth, we have not seen any money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; the economist said. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem in the other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit. </seg>
<seg id="667"> Take them in the impoverished people who have nothing to offer in the provision. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Interest on such loans are high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they often do not return,&quot; said Mr. only. </seg>
<seg id="670"> However the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured credit. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Director of HSE banking institution Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit organizations, not having access to cheap resources, which have banks, were forced to raise funds for the population at a high interest rate. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response banks took to the trail of war and began to cut lending rates,&quot; the economist continued. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest, otherwise they will be negative interest margin. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If banks does not waive dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, said Vasily Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> A holder of the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, an economist says harbinger of mass collapse. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;banks themselves don&apos;t cope with such a situation: A system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warned the head of the Institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in prestigious, civil servants and the military - because of the refusal of wage indexation, inherent in the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partly hit consumption will be softened freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the decline in inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partly: If investments don&apos;t rise (as preconditions to that as long as there is no - see a certificate), consumption growth will slow, sure of Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> In his estimation, Russia&apos;s economy will shrink at the price of oil below $90/bbl. </seg>
<seg id="684"> Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is still unable to lower interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> There is a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise the stakes. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This may mean that they do not believe the Central Bank, even the transition to targeting inflation,&quot; said Clemens only. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The Central Bank policy interest rates does not affect the market, affects only on interbank lending rates. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;it&apos;s the collapse of all hopes for the Central Bank,&quot; Clemens appreciated only one person. </seg>
<seg id="689"> The money generated by auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not lending to the economy and to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as the rate decreases, immediately changing the exchange rate, this means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;sooner or later the Central Bank realize that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr. only and recalled that the state take the ruble in &quot;floating&quot; plans by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But will have to either do it before, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes. </seg>
<seg id="693"> In his estimation, the ruble exchange rate now artificially overvalued by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The ruble only one road is weakening,&quot; concludes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the Central Bank seront finalists a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to a weakening of the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much stronger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden has agreed to testify about proslushke Merkel </seg>
<seg id="697"> A member of the Bundestag GansKristian Stroebele met Edward Snowden Moscow. </seg>

<seg id="699"> Snowden has expressed a willingness to give testimony is needed. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He clearly indicated,&quot; said GansKristian Strebel, &quot;that knows very much. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the National Security Agency over Kim Alexander blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> But first we have to determine all the conditions of his arrival. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, US lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding US spy programs. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved the bill,) additional restrictions on the activities of America&apos;s electronic intelligence agency. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Fau: &quot;air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on a cell phone,&quot; according to the new guidelines, published on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers should not expect that the changes would happen immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update its manuals for flight crew members and the rules for the installation of devices, to comply with the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Fau said that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;depending on the state of the plan we could approve expanding the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; said FAA. </seg>
<seg id="714"> At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door is closed. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They should not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet elevation and the captain does not provide &quot;good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most of the new jetliners and other planes, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional cabin, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;after the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this), it will be a win-win scenario,&quot; said Glading. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We frankly tired feel &quot;dejure at school,&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But the connection to the Internet for surfing, email exchange of letters, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Thus, still no &quot;Words with friends&quot; - intellectual gaming, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when the sensational case occurred: The actor was removed from the plane, the airline&apos;s American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> A heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be laid in the luggage department, because they can injure someone if will fly around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulatory authority on phone calls are owned by the Federal Communications Commission, not FAA. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Fau may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month the National Council for Transport Safety, a national security expert Mark Rosenker transportation of CBS News, said that cell phones are still risk. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;cell phones - it really is the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC Rules that they can interfere with cell phone towers, when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Industry advisory committee, the FAA to consider the matter, recommended last month that the government has allowed more widespread use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> In recent years growing pressure on FAA with the aim of easing restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Critics, such as October from Missouri Claire McCaskill argue that there is no compelling reason for prohibitions related to security. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The restrictions also becomes more and more difficult to secure, as the use of the devices has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Fau beginning to limit the use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of peach passengers for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry radiopriemniki - high-tech gadgets at the time. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved FAA as resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The airline&apos;s offer to passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already within a few years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The planes, modified for system, also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority ships fitted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Ward. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices usually emit radio much lower power than the previous generation of devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when relisted pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But the signals are becoming more powerful, when devices download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those who pursued easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices passengers, was the company basis </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011, the company&apos;s representatives have downloaded an airliner with their own devices for reading electronic books the Kindle and flew on it, to check for problems, but never found them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Members of the Advisory Committee of FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is a risk. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he believes interference from real devices, even if the risks are minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The other members of the committee said that there is only one message pilots, confirming that the devices could interfere for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Nevertheless, the committee recommended that FAA allowed pilots to require passengers to disable the device during landings on components in limited visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a lot of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We are pleased that FAA acknowledges that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, the director general of the Tourist Association of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed antinicotine vaccine, which could deprive the process of cigarette smoking pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests are needed before tests on humans, it will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We hope that such a strategy of using a vaccine may, at last, to help millions of smokers who tried to quit, gave all methods available in the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies antinicotine. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker nicotine strike. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In tests vaccine mouse, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="778"> A mouse, which did not give the vaccine,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brain,&quot; the researchers said,. </seg>
<seg id="779"> These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would have been to give children, will appear before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But more likely it will be used smokers to quit smoking. </seg>

<seg id="809"> But most of them were not hand baggage charges. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage charge three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with this collection is a Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant on airlines said Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks extra fees. </seg>
<seg id="812"> In his assessment in the report from December 2011, gathering for hand baggage Spirit brings $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection Spirit for hand baggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;the boarding process was the most smooth of those that I have seen in his career in airlines,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing went rapidly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier also follows Spirit in respect of the $2 for coffee, tea, juice or Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier said that passengers who receive gazing or juice, can leave yourself all the bank and that the coffee will be available for free. </seg>
<seg id="819"> She will still see distribute water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> Us Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so in seven months, after passengers have started to complain and no other major airline did not follow its example. </seg>
<seg id="821"> The Frontier initiative to levy hand baggage fees when passengers don&apos;t buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the last measure to attract customers to its Web site. </seg>
<seg id="822"> The airlines pay onlinprodavtam tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to purchase tickets directly from them, rather than turn in tourist onlinagentstvo. </seg>
<seg id="824"> But Frontier went further all in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September she started to give bonus miles in two times less often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday she cut the number of miles to 25 percent from presale miles of travel. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, the trip to 1,000 miles with Frontier, acquired the online travel agency, would get 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> The Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becomes unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities have declined by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic is trying to rectify finance Frontier as part of the sale of the airline. </seg>

<seg id="857"> The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors received the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a man willing to cooperate. </seg>

<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European country that recognized the third floor in children born with the type of outdoor sex organs. </seg>
<seg id="870"> Newborn will no longer have to ascribe male or female sex. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;unidentified&quot; in their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can take hasty decisions about operations by pre-empting sex newborn, and counter discrimination intersexual people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One intersexual people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and not a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> I stay created doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars. </seg>

<seg id="877"> Wallis Simpson, may have been intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="878"> The gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that, if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it, than to wait and monitor the child&apos;s psychological and physical development before the operation, if at all that happens. </seg>
<seg id="879"> The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in issues of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most of them children have not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign to the floor without surgery and then see how a person develops. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science of how a child will develop a gender identity, are not accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> No one can answer questions about why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It is a mystery about why people are being homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersexual people as different from transgender or transgender, because their condition is relevant not to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not meet the floor is neither male nor female, and typically for both at the same time or not is not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics can manifest in secondary sexual signs, such as muscle mass, the distribution of the head, the chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also gives a general idea about discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes based on prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boys with gender variations now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults to be male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia Norris MayUelbi became the first person in the world that recognized &quot;pole,&quot; octave in court the right to maintain &quot;uncertain&quot; sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be used in addition to M &amp; F - X, i.e. intersexual third designation. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighboring France gender issues still cause controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this &quot;gender theory&quot; pronounced Catholic countries have signed a petition for exemption from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we perevorachivaem another two pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children installed floor at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;raise a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said the Web site for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - on the beautiful Greek god, which had signs of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And yet just ten years ago the medical community vosprinimalo gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many contest ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that the gender identity complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive assigned him to the floor when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;in the middle of the 20th century, it was called &quot;urgent mental case&quot;,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When the children were born, you called not psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory about how to deal with children with similar genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He has put into circulation the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the environment, including the social signals - the way parents raise the child, the child is interact with genes and hormones, determining whether a person considered himself a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories were in question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision, fully castrate child, also by removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> &quot;Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But in 38 years he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these operations for a sex change, said about himself,&quot; with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> This was the case and Jim Bruce, the writer&apos;s form from the state of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes A_____ B_____, but similar genitals intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a small penis or large clitoris, and were convinced that he will never be able to live a &quot;normal life&quot; men. </seg>
<seg id="915"> So soon after his birth in 1976 external genital organ and Bruce lyrics testicles surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He began the female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> He was appointed vaginoplasty in 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But while in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he required medical documentation. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he learned was terrible. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give him the body to produce testosterone enough for the normal development of genital mutilation. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his chest. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The operation made him infertile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today he serves in the defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to lead a normal perception of people with intersexuality. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Anne TemarMettis, executive director of the California Faculty Association Advocates for pub Choice, concerned that a German law &quot;urges however shortcuts and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that a German law would encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child &quot;uncertain&quot; floor,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to gain male or female sex, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we have not yet seen, as manifest themselves this law, so all we can do is to build the assumptions. </seg>
<seg id="932"> TemarMettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;adult people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The German law implies its assignment at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This is the battle, in which young children do not have to enter at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr Arlene Baratz mammologrentgenolog from Pittsburgh, which have a daughter in violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;support&quot; of both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Bart daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called &quot;full nechuvstvitelnosti syndrome to androgens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="939"> Because of its androgenic receptors work incorrectly, Cathy have developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has the vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, in 29 years, Kathy married and passes residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="943"> The law gives parents the time not to take any hasty decisions for themselves,&quot; said Bart. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He gives them time to make any tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="945"> In this case you in order to raise a child, like a child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a child, and you feel the joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We do not need hastily to do the operation, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;This allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> In the end the child decides what floor he or she is more comfortable, and it&apos;s wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> It gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own. </seg>

<seg id="1018"> Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and operations on cataract removal, will help to overcome the backlog. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> There is also money for clinics taking patients without reservation, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after flap, training of medical professionals, mental health services and systems implementation personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &quot;These investments will go to the best doctors made the implementation of Tasmania&apos;s ideas on how best to help the health care system,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The minister insisted that Tasmania&apos;s government will work in strict accountability and responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> State will need to maintain current funding levels to receive funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> The commission will be created from three people to make sure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible and dyne. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million doesn&apos;t solve anything,&quot; if not for them will be followed by a genuine reform, which would put Tasmania&apos;s health system on a more sustainable basis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the Prime Minister in early May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system this State out of critical condition,&quot; said Mr Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for the recent reduction. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement represents &quot;a solution, similar leycoplasteru.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;the reason why we are here, is that the Labour government of the state had $430 million from the health system,&quot; he said broadcasters ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the government of lifting almost half a billion dollars, but Commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek guarantee that neither one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> A cry of despair voter Obama </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope to change </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He says that Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism nullify laudable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Obstructionism cannot serve as an excuse to problems with the site reformed Obama&apos;s health care system, the drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Memoirs of Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign are a sad reminder that could be </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the medical faculty at Harvard University. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I read terribly sad book in these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of the medical faculty and restore a sense of hope in me. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It is called &quot;the temerity to win,&quot; and it&apos;s memoirs about Barack Obama&apos;s 2008 presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> The evening when I finish writing reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The election victory was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historic moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates wept with joy, and my parents lacking all newspapers that they could only find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> The White House had come a young team strategists, and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> During Obama&apos;s accession to the post in 2008, its level of support was 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> A return at present is a rude awakening, as vding of dreams. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It&apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> For years that have passed since then, as I lowered my first ballot, change is indeed occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It was something that I could not even imagine. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on medical care available to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&quot; rule, the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, too much choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after countless number of times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended the explanation that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I have reached the point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Republican obstructionism could not explain the resolution on the Departments of foreign leaders or strikes pilots on innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> He cannot explain the collection of data about the private lives of Americans or prosecution National Security Agency whistleblower, outlines the government&apos;s misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with public financing and spending limits during the presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, in which the White House said that pricladyvaemse efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And the last time he cannot justify what you cannot develop a Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on medical care available. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I don&apos;t know whether I do this was to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It is obvious that work for elective office is not predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Yet for all I have listed above examples we see that they were largely the administration&apos;s own choice. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And that&apos;s what worries me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney was a strange and brutal alternative, it seemed that he is not in a position to make a decision on its own policy or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I believed that Obama in his second term, freed from the pressure of future elections, meets, of which we have heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, when this week Obama&apos;s rating fell below 45%, to return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> This makes me pine for many promises that letched. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week I read that part of the book, in which describes how Clinton dealt Obama a resounding defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At the meeting to analyze the reasons for the setbacks he has told its employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to its purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I want to make sure that we returned to our appeal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> &quot;We should remember who we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1074"> It has been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you completely. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Take an oath in Egypt&apos;s first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but his day celebrations is unlikely to be sad an end to political strife in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; that brought an oath change, becoming the country&apos;s first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took an oath before 18 judges in black were in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, shown live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, 60th engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was banned organization, which target for tough action changed each other&apos;s governments. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, when Morsi arrived with a small procession shortly after 11 a.m. local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building, to welcome the new president, and, in contrast to the days of Mubarak&apos;s presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time, to miss its civilians at the normally busy road connecting the city center with southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although Morsi ridiculed as &quot;spare wheel&quot; uncharismatic &quot;Brothers,&quot; his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and panic speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but all those who want to bring to the business end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Egypt today is civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with red tie, judges in the hall, where he took an oath obesity wooden panels. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Later Morsi headed Cairo University, where he was to speak in his inauguration speech. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> He was the initial official reception with military orchestra, other state anthem, during which he stood at attention.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Attended a military figure the Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;Army and the people are one hand&quot; who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising was born, zavershivshee Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian rule last year, and has promised to return the president&apos;s powers, which his office was deprived of the military council, who undertake the affairs of the deposed leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, not in front of the parliament, as it is accepted, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Morsi&apos;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> School courses of English literature will require that students studying at least one Shakespeare play, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> The exam will also be presented &quot;unprogramme texts,&quot; to encourage more extensive reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> The combined rate of English literature and language will be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015, pupils will be required to pass a graduation exam on language, with persistent recommendations of choice of English literature as a separate exam. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Department of Education should tomorrow to release a new curriculum for English and math - the first subjects, discharged radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> He will make changes to other major items in the next year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Separately the regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure graduating high school exams, with a new evaluation system and less exchange works. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that was &quot;reached broad consensus is that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that the school graduation exams would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that English schools paying less time math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during the quarter), than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> By comparison, the Australian schools give 143 hours a year on average, and in Singapore students are engaged in about 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Although the formal requirements will not be to spend more time in the schedule of math, coalition sources said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics, combined with increased factor in the ratings table, most likely will serve as an incentive to provide additional training schools on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> The curriculum more attention will be given to &quot;the tasks of real life,&quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football is the reason for discord? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma in the framework of the &quot;open rostrum&quot; politicians and experts were talking about how to preserve national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals was and is: To ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - some scandals and discord. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about recent events in Biryulevo and said that to reduce the &quot;degree of tension in society&quot; politicians and the media should be correct in statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Perhaps he was referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovski in one of the shows, which threatened to surround the Caucasus barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate... </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All the speakers talked and on measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples, enjoying Russia that gave the debate somber. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoriev said that events in Biryulevo - &quot;model conflict, which could have been predicted,&quot; but &quot;for these questions we have answers too many people and courts,&quot; and had seven babysitters child without an eye. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time in terms of migrants practised Europe, according to obgestvennica failed, and we need to find their own way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> The historian Yuri Petrov pinned high hopes on the new unified history textbook. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;still need to create a manual on the history of the peoples of the country&apos;s culture, schoolchildren in Tatarstan to know that for people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov has proposed to impose criminal responsibility for &quot;appeals to dismember Russia&quot;: &quot;if in the United States said on the radio that Russia should be given to Alaska, then you&apos;d be arrested and will give 20 years in prison!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried &quot;not good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, in everything he accused journalists that withdrawing sick and pressing national problems on public discussion: &quot;in the heat of little debate whether what you can say.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> &quot;United Russia&quot; faction leader Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised reporters to sign a &quot;charter&quot; and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then can take similar commitments and policy. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We have approved about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is set, Mr. Vasiliev said. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example, he cited the law which imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace in their territory. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Ludmila Andrichenko delight over this law is not divided: There is not &quot;a clear view of what is an adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> It means that the subjects will interpret differently the volume of these powers. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Municipalities have no personnel needed to address such complex issues, there is no money, and guidelines, which they could use, the center did not give them... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities Gajimet Safaraliev offered to create a special agency with formidable called &quot;the Ministry of National Security,&quot; which would have been national policy issues. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valery Artem Tishkov, which in the 1990s was led by the same agency, uprazdnennoe later, opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It is enough to have a special person at the federal level,&quot; the minister without portfolio,&quot; to which one might ask, if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We walk on the edge, shells break next, is very important to representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together oppose provocations, and this work must receive adequate information support,&quot; said a representative of the ROC for relations with the society Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> No state neutrality in respect of dangerous ideologies, including religious be, in his opinion, shouldn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Then Oleg Nilov removed the debate in an unexpected direction: &quot;more talented people than in Chechnya and Dagestan, another search is necessary, but pushing them is not on the way, not on the road,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;not the way&quot; - this is the development of football: &quot;the footballer beat the crowds, the flags wiring, the comrades stones throw each other... </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe we do not need such a football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another kind of sports - rugby is called... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;will not be equal to them in the world in this sport!&quot; - hotly spravoross said. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> No one will not be playing rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You still curling them offer! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> We need to know the national peculiarities, it&apos;s all the same that &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; Gruzin suggest...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands made by representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football will have to ban all over the country... </seg>
<seg id="1142"> The recognition of the National Security Agency reinforce paranoia corporations in terms of government surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> A warm afternoon in late August German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media say the BfV had hoped to discover the assignment, and these actions entailed negotiations between the United States and Germany&apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Clapper, US director of national intelligence, in September again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence opportunities&quot; for theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But since Edward Snowden - contract employees who became razoblacitelem - began to publish its treasury intelligence secrets of the United States, European governments and companies more leaders are not sure whether to believe the director on the word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports that the US national security agency followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored in the cloud provider&apos;s corporations, the United States, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia caused by observation of the state, to a new height. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone auditioned, perhaps, about ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, that is, of course, are potential targets, and business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the United States and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think, it is likely that these data are used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany should wake up,&quot; says Oliver BITMi Green, president of the association, which represents small and medium-sized производство Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies are convinced that the United States is now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to the study, published in July EY consulting agency. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> In all, Mr. Snowden crest documents, however, so far there was no evidence that the US transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain features in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Businessmen skeptical to this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in Germany&apos;s parliament says that we should create a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can just close your eyes and slowly open them again... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;This is not an option,&quot; says its report Hasso Plattner, president of German business software SAP. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a need for a powerful European skill, would not allow her to die more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> All subsidized in Germany: From coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> All, except for the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> And yet the coverage and technical development agencies in the United States, which have become known thanks to the revelation Snowden espionage were a shock for some companies that previously thought that the biggest risk surveillance is China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> A big shift happening in cloud technology, where the leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to the survey, conducted the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-US players have abandoned plans to use the services of a cloud provider based in the United States after revelations of U.S. programs for mining Prism. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Jim Snabe, one of the SAP Executive Board, said: &quot;We see that consumers ask a new question, which did not occur a year ago, namely: Where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they are physically will remain in this jurisdiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German leaders argue that the last message is only a confirmation of what they already knew: Powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and, therefore, these data should be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> What is going on economic espionage is of no surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> He has always had a place. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;It was the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive director of chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we also spin for them, because it is in our national interests - to protect our commercial enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast of those retaliation, which they took as this may give an advantage to the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In large companies have long been learned the thought that I take free at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is, to say the least, thoughtless. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the car company Audi, says that for many years it is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before board meetings, so that they could not be used as bugs device. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The Federal Service for the protection of the German constitution recommends that managers of companies to consider the possibility of using simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Prepaid mobile phones are discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Yet there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to [and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many such companies are leaders in their particular niche in the world market. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,&quot; the BfV report warns. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> The United States warn their own companies about economic espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> A summary of the US National Intelligence in February put France, along with Russia and Israel in the second series of violators who are engaged in antihacking for economic intelligence, after China, The Washington Post said. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage,&quot; the French worst of all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French agency DCRI domestic intelligence, reportedly said in an interview in this month: &quot;service well know that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spying for its allies.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1899"> The main task of inspectors was not to lose time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more himorujiya - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> For these production facilities will now watch carefully to prevent their repairs. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The next milestone - the middle of November: By this time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan of destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The issues here a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where they will be unitiated? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide the equipment for this? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian statements will be carefully checked Western razvedslujbami. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They readily advised the inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus was not fully candid. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The United States believe that the shelling was carried out by regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The international community demanded from the Syrian leadership is in accordance with the agreement, reached under the mediation of Russia, is to destroy or bring in outside the state of all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and for filling shells these substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now that this phase is completed, the next step should be the elimination of already existing in the Syrian army himorujiya. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is expected that this arsenal may be has more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances, cojnonaryvnogo mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozens of different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> To destroy it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start agreed on a schedule of action - on this for two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The head of field operations OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally watched the destruction of equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;They now do not have the ability to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The OPCW statement said that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and sure that factories for the production of shells and poisonous substances either destroyed or are ruined. </seg>

<seg id="1919"> George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives it a choice </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another strashilka on independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we warn that an independent Scotland would have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Performers turn stories about Service passport control and the border with barbed wire along the shaft Adriana. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movements in the rest of Europe, though - that predictably - it&apos;s not appeared in headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Nobody also pointed out that the EU&apos;s members spend a lot of time to turn its formal rules as it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Because Scotland now is not included in the Schengen area, continued non-compliance requirements will be cheap concession to Brussels in return what he really wanted from Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So this is not a credible story. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And so old that it turned into a fossil: For the first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; about what &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Yet there is an interesting moment, lost to paraphrase the old tales. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why should an independent Scotland at all to execute commands in Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Here&apos;s a real European news: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally has stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With the project &quot;Europe&quot; eurocrisis officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Across the European Union Party, opposed the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; - eurosceptic party founded only this year - appeared from nowhere and received nearly five million votes in last September&apos;s federal elections, thus essentially replacing &quot;the Free Democrats&quot; (analogue our &quot;liberal Democrats&quot;) of Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Always there was internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to the idea that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, - it was only fair for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In fact Eurosystem blocked their members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, is that German politicians and want to save. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is at a disadvantage to manufacturing capabilities in comparison with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only saving means - to cut wages and government spending that is actively supported Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> For the current budget problems and a currency worth a deeper problem, Europe&apos;s productive capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of the complex of measures to &quot;green&quot; energy, embedded Brussels, a cipher, meaning subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> This paralyze adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing salaries in the world will not be deterred crushing victory cheap US shale gas over European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result of incorporation of the revolt, especially in France, once the probably stone EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin is no longer needs in Paris as a tool of political legitimacy, and Europe has already imposed its own economic policy, leaving destroyed France&apos;s economy in a mess. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> The result is right, acting against the EU&apos;s Marine Le Pen of the National Front party just won the decisive extra election, violently the ruling Socialist Party in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;front&quot; is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning British Labour about the fact that you cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right will automatically be dropped in favor of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What makes Le Pen with his newly inherited popularity among French white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year, in order to create the bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If - and this is very likely - are configured against the EU&apos;s party will get support in this election, the bloc will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my opinion: The growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe soon merge together, to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU will not go away, but he will again become something like blurred &quot;European sovereign nations,&quot; which enjoyed of General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I guess the United Kingdom reproduction of this project, hoping to move closer to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Yet the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific points to the likelihood that the United Kingdom will remain unaddressed in the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In what position this leaves Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become a region (essentially) Minor England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send in Berlin and Brussels a handbasket. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the framework of a free European agreement provided that we keep its currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other stranamiedinomyshlennikami will be easier in federal Europe of nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The Scottish Nationalist Party government in Scotland is - ironically - the most successful political movement in Europe aimed against austerity, received a majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts proposed (and sold) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister Darling and effective later coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Scotland would now be absurd to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early puberty: Aging before </seg>
<seg id="2044"> African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely, studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals to blame </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge - a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Whether the mother put, if her daughter are beginning to form the beginnings of breast and lobe hair grow 7 or 8 years old? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite prevalent among American girls and represent a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time, still parents - usually does not mean a complete puberty,&quot; said rapid offensive Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> The obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, lobe and provides the hair and body odor, appear before in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But it was only a small shift in the age of the first period (menarche) over the last four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has decreased compared to 12,75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;after the chest starts to grow, at least two or three years to menarche passes,&quot; said Kaplitt, also is the author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> There is debate about what is the actual offensive sexual maturity, but is considered to be &quot;premature,&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will slow or will slow down is that the pediatrician can monitor carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses have endocrinologist, in order to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in mature age. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> The psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplowitz careful with drugs, but acknowledges that &quot;the suppression of puberty may mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don&apos;t want to have them very young daughters were menstruation. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They are worried about the risks of pregnancy or even how they cope with health issues,&quot; said Kaplitt. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, whose daughter menstruation began in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn&apos;t emotionally ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> She came home from school frightened and frustrated by the fact that she was the first among his friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are lots of muchheralded theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Yet there is no consistent evidence of what is to blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> The boys - like puberty in girls have come earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with terms of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other data confirm that conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> All over the world to early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another mystery: Although the boys have hair on the face and the lobe appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual refurbishment is not as pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors, AAP participating in the conference, confirmed the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair found even in infants and children of the nursery age. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We must be careful about how we define the true offensive puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Children&apos;s Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from pediatrician about how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;It may mean earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls who bloom early, you need proof that even when this happens sooner than we needed, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2448"> Credit on bail jewelry is not just the fastest way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingan), but also almost as cheaply as unsecured bank loans. </seg>

<seg id="2453"> This week&apos;s Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the rating agency, indicated an increase in household leverage, mostly because of rising mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks&quot; creditworthiness. </seg>

<seg id="2515"> Black box you have in your car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> As long as American designers of roads are trying to find the money to repair highways rasping system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box, neatly prison on the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices, tracking every proezjaemuu automobilist mile and transmit this information officials, are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize an outdated system of financing America&apos;s highways, 13 Washington&apos;s routine bodies and state. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has sparked intense debate and colourful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the rights of small drawers government to track the number of miles you preseed and even, perhaps, of where you pass them, - and then use this information in drawing up the tax bills. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The tea parties in shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about the private lives. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And although Congress wait as long as several states cannot agree to continue or not, will not. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They wonder how in the next decade, you can go to the system, in which drivers pay for every mile of road they cars. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists already taken for testing these black boxes, part of which have the function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> It is really necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;It is not the question on which we can be the right choice,&quot; said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, preseed every Californian automobilist, by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The technology for this is already there. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds for the construction of highways, funded by the expense of government taxes that Americans pay at petrol stations. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans already don&apos;t buy as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars passing more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, not appreciated for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save,&quot; said Lee Munnich, transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In his state was recently installed on cars 500 tracking devices for testing pile payment system. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;this will be the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Sandy call this pile user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals because, with the help of taxes, it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> The authorities in California could to this system in the course of development strategies to achieve targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to fight global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> But Bill Shuster, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, is considering this system as the most viable long-term alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Followers of the free market in the fund &quot;Reason&quot; is also delighted of that force drivers to pay for each mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;This is not a simple tax that will go away in a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People directly pay for what they receive. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of pil payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The US Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, in which was attended by about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, the House of Representatives leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters, which in everyday life often have to come so many miles to get to work or to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several states and cities, however, are on the way on their own. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The most enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where to take part in the experiment in the country held 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon be pay per mile run state instead of a tax on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada, a pilot project has already been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York, he is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois probe it on a limited basis with the participation of the truck. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> But the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments Pennsylvania, East Coast 17 states, including Maryland, Virginia and Florida), studies, as they will be able to make these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept has not received universal recognition. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track them every step. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;concern about the &quot;big brother&quot; and things like this is a big problem,&quot; said Allauddin Khan, head of strategy and management issues efficiency in transport department of the State of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> This was not what people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When the tests were underway, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warning on its website: &quot;will be very easy to turn these devices in a full-scale tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably widen to store records of their daily movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches are conducted an inexpensive technology, which would have allowed state authorities to take preseed vehicle miles, but no information about the place and time. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you can do it, Khan said, the public will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The search for this technology have led some state agencies to a young company in California called True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Initially, the company did not support in collecting state taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She sought out the emerging market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the device, which she tests, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, from time to time to be loaded by modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do so, if you have not spent their speed and not spent their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There have been a few more errors in some of these pilot programs in the state. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon designers experimenting with providing drivers of different options. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can choose the device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they cannot abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that passing all residents of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places are hoping to sell the idea of a wary public, forcing the device to do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop nalogooblagangee device, which will also take charge for parking meters, to provide the &quot;pay as pedal&quot; insurance and collect pool speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;motorists will involve the benefits they offer,&quot; said in the document urban design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers transportation systems, however, think about whether all the talk about pil payment are not just a huge otvlecaty factor. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In the city&apos;s transportation commission in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say, Congress would have been very easy to overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> Additional lump or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so they paid their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;there is no need for radical surgery, when all you need to do is to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public relations commission. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and a variety of other things. </seg>

<seg id="2589"> Consistory next year will have great significance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment there is some kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> &quot;will be interesting to see whether the new dad prescribe the cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are insignificant number of the cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> It will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the Council of the cardinals by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which mandated to seek ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> In the past, all dad decided on their own. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;Francis has chosen eight cardinals that they helped him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> He said that &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis will turn to cardinal for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we have not been in this situation before this is all of this for us for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valero said that the Pope is usually built office Cardinal Bishops from large parishes, but Francis&quot; is full of surprises - so we do not know whom he named.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2735"> Would lead the construction of TPU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> With each passing year the capital authorities promise to furnish more transportnoperesadochnyh knots (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Until 2020 is scheduled to enter into service 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> What actually is the project, assorted our correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago &quot;Smolensk&quot; ArbatscoPokrovskoy subway line have a construction fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The inscription is stated that the resettlement project node. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> All of this was very strange, because next to &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport does not stop and, therefore, you cannot take on him. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to overcome some 130 meters, including ground transition through Carmanita lane. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now, almost all &quot;Smolensk&quot; have finished. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Disappeared flower stall, demolished stand for newspapers, and asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by the residents. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> That&apos;s the hub. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transportnoperesadochnye nodes are plastic and capital,&quot; explains in the press service of the capital&apos;s transport department. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Capital TPU as long as it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> And billets suggest the construction of parking, the withdrawal of trade objects that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Actually, planet TPU even do not transporters, and professional blagoustroiteli from the department of major overhaul of the city of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The transport unit is not necessarily complex design, explains the Higher School of Economics, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and transport policy Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes a roof over his head and the scoreboard operas about the time of arrival of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Here, for example, the &quot;establishment&quot; metro have recently opened a full-fledged billets locations node. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Even without canopies, but with privatives parking lots and the scoreboard, indicating that when the bus comes. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of officials record in TPU all that neither once. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Back in 2011, the Mayor&apos;s Office planned to build all of these 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now in the plans until 2020 are up 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> Of these some 200 promise to pass more this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although in the city have TPU development program, has not indicated any qualitative criteria,&quot; Alexander Morozov concludes, co-chair of the public organization &quot;City and transport.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First - reducing the time transplantation, second - convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all to change of transport, not going out in the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow, the after-school TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> A vivid example of the underground &quot;VDNH.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Before suburban buses with Yaroslavsky highway came in the square in front of the main entrance at VVC. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now they stop moved on the opposite side of the street Yaroslavsky focus. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Farther from the metro, much further from morels, but closer to residential homes. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The gift that residents do not want to bus station under windows and complained in every possible instance. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital TPU in Moscow had somehow immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them began to build five years ago in the underground &quot;Planner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project is intended to have been a model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And indeed is an example of how the node locations, bequeathed to investors, turns into a banal shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, there are persons for buses, shed, not to go from the subway in the rain, and the three floors car parking spaces. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> True, Khimkinsky trolleybus No. 202 and 203 in Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Them as someone else&apos;s postponed away from the metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But the place under trade more left. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> One only 32 clothing store, and in general have almost everything - from pet products to a car dealership. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well, in fact, suddenly who of bus passengers will need to buy a new car in the road? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> We have, when build capital TPU, for some reason always out shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> The situation reached its logical conclusion, as part of a parking lot recently decided to give it to the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of the TPU &quot;Planner&quot; among razmechennyh parking spaces on the floor is brisk market. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and the security guards, angrily pogladyvangie on our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> The node locations have finally turned into a bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The point is that before the subway &quot;Planner&quot; market, but it was demolished. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> But in Prefecture traders regretted and go on privatives parking organization host. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> All the same because of high prices there are always empty. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The same ridiculous that market demolished in order to build in its place... new billets TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> So here&apos;s rock. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> The distance from the lobby metro subway &quot;Kaluga&quot; have to bus was 50 meters, said Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, distance has increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> In order to get on a bus, you have to go through the whole mall. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 22 hours, when it closed, have to circumvent it under the open sky. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> However, construction on &quot;Player&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; soon seem around the neck. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The mayor&apos;s office in the middle of September gradostroitelnozemelnaya Commission approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25etazhnsmi, not counting two or three underground floors. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> The monster will grow from underground &quot;Tushino,&quot; it will be 4187 thousand square meters. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Representatives of the railway stations Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU underground, have already told reporters: In future meetings raspolojitysya3 shops, hotels and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Officials argue that parking lot Zai mouth from a third to half of the square. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Take for example the &quot;people&apos;s&quot; garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Say, garage for 258 machinest, which recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So, for parking at 2.6 thousands of auto &quot;PetrovscoRazumovskoy&quot; will need about 80 thousand &quot;squares.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2801"> It is less one third from the machine that there are going to build. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Let one or two floors will be spent on any person for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Remains of at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> And this, in a minute, almost two GUM. </seg>

<seg id="2864"> Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, said Thursday on reducing net profit by 15 percent under the influence of lessives number of orders and deliveries of the planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail unit. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Located in the Montreal company Bombardier also published no data on flight testing its new CSeries aircraft and not provided new information about whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft will be performed in commercial operation to the next September. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, held about one and a half months ago, he flew only three more times that raises questions about whether the stage of testing on schedule. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> The results were acquitted of forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered its rating from &quot;higher on Thursday as &quot;before&quot; as &quot;because of the belief that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> &quot;Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we, of course, disappointed profit indicators of the transport department,&quot; said Derksen in the review of the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as it unfolds flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical to the program. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will allow her to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and made the flight in September for the first time after several months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the firm order for the CSeries yet not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests, to check the company&apos;s assertions about the fuel efficiency and new liner potential efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> There are only now 403 order and an agreement with 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> CEO Pierre Beaudoin was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal in 300 firm orders by the time when the first aircraft will be launched in commercial operation. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> On Thursday the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> &quot;test model of the aircraft remained on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Beaudoin during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests were planned on aircraft downtime and software updates. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> All manufacturers plan to tests in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We decided to conduct the first flight and make a break on the upgrade, and so we did. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> So will occur during the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Yet analysts skeptical statement about the fact that the first client will be able to start operating CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bombardier said it estimates the commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> &quot;This slow the pace of flight tests - at least, apparently, and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Derksen. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> In the third quarter, Bombardier okonchivshemsya September 30, net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> The portfolio of orders aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> &quot;in the aerospace field results consistent with our goals, however, a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor,&quot; said Beaudoin. </seg>
