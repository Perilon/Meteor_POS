<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders have justified their policies by the necessity of combating spin in the election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the centre of бреннана believe last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws of the registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only one 2011 was taken 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new laws on elections require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, voter registration упраздняют right on the day of the balloting and take away the right to vote among citizens who have the conviction. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state, which introduced such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 2008, adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During the last two years, they initiated bills, forcing voters to present identification card with a photo, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal identity cards, as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, 11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people who have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012, do not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that&apos;s not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It is the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, apparently aimed to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction does not passed without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign to register voters helped make the lists of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall by 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with come from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike the whites who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several projects of the laws was ветировано governors Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The action of the most controversial laws was suspended for intervention by the attorney general of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has partly to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring presenting identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules into effect, of course, will make the exercise of voting rights in the elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report from the Center for бреннана 2011 demonstrates that states that accepted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test of the dog gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to unnecessary medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, there are what hesitate even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of the two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, were observed numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so it is difficult to interpret the data and difficult to work out any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who were screened and those who have not passed. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed that after a 12-year-old observation that the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men are African American also are at higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer is detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to clarify the risk of cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making choices in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who have detected the cancer, will undergo a course of treatment because their cancer was not aggressive and do not pose a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, we have to define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not pass the course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, мовембер created a tool to assess all the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all the people were great and quite moving, 30% of cases RACO could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;if no one smoked, the figure rose to at least up to 50%,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, an estimated 10% of the cases of cancer caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is doing immense harm to the health of people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers,&quot; says the press secretary Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Payroll: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight of </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to Kar, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and ovarian cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer,&quot; adds to the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The association also recommends that limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities, it increases the risks of cancer of the colon. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Also should be avoided meat products. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explained to the association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> B vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists were engaged in studying the impact of vitamin on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment, the results of these studies is not exactly clear. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs бозон details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer the message that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs бозон caused a real boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this бозон explains the mass of all particles in the universe, no. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or, at least, &quot;the least imperfect&quot; descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, &quot;but which had not managed to uncover experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But the physics is not yet completely confident that he was talking about бозоне Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly resembles бозон Higgs predicted the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although for the full confidence of some data still lacks. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same, that we are talking about бозоне Higgs, because the chances of mistaken seem minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There are, in this world one law is absolutely inevitable that recalls that two things may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way around this rule, even don&apos;t try too hard, otherwise harm themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of similar nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which posits that the two particles can&apos;t occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;Elementary&quot; is a &quot;state&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this, the particle physics is divided into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find the good citizens, called фермионами who wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In the other, scurrying around бозоны, stark Banda anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can be safe in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley Lab, these бозоны split, in turn into two groups: мезоны that we are here to say we will not, and &quot;particles of power&quot; through which apply basic forces of nature and that in some way relates бозон Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures such as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this chronicle, then it is thanks to one incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or &quot;particle of light,&quot; which is a &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when one particle with the electrical charge, is accelerating or changing direction, it &quot;violates the&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, just like the stone in the pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violations&quot; born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing like фотоном - and, therefore, one of the carriers &quot;бозонов force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> The more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same thing is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this бозон appeared to be &quot;broken&quot; another field, the Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; that his Institute, the need to achieve a very, very high energy, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN&apos;s Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all the particles and not all of the materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way), it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;can do&quot; all of these studies, asked Ms. пламондон? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, some of them passionately yearn to such divergence discovered because any disagreements may open the door for a &quot;New Physics&quot; and plug some holes model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, not offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (ouch-ouch!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But so far at CERN such conflict have not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences of the </seg>
<seg id="137"> The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: in the early 1960s pioneers laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, since the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, was invented the laser, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen as a &quot;laboratory gadget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine.... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application may be a tool for accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> It is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will soon be resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless, in this important area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;the debt&quot; attempted to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in монтережи. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, разрушавший inside him, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-гадбуа in белёй where arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;but it&apos;s always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its job: incredible weakness, which does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table, on which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He бодрится even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead him into the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in the normal death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;my greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this sickness. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;for the life we are taught that a man must pee standing,&quot; said Pierre Browder, a psychologist at the orphanage, Victor-гадбуа. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;everything depends on the ability of the person&quot; adjusting to the decline, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who arrive in palliative shelter Victor-гадбуа, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts say they have a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called &quot;therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years old, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to know their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in life,&quot; she says, before being allowed to put her mask, relieving breathing. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She still waiting in the coming days, the last visit his son, recruited from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the runaway victor-гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is the palliative care, which remains when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death of more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one seat in the institutions of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctors shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it&apos;s the comfort of the physical, emotional or soul. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we agree to provide ротовые rinse of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We are not forcing more diabetics control blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought the beer, Mr. H., who died last night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son swilled down a beer in the legs of the late. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;we are helping the relatives, as well as the patients,&quot; said Nathalie Savar, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the runaway victor-гадбуа not one day is not similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to a 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with family in the yard, relaxing on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and перепробоваший everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;in the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; says Dr. Christian мартель concerned. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-гадбуа, come from the house, and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is available to alleviate the suffering of patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, at the hospital or in the orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-гадбуа and society of palliative care at home of Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec is causing many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of the law, легализирующего assisted death and assistance in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October circulates manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Christian мартель, Quebec health system is effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, &quot;she says,&quot; I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I&apos;m afraid that patients are willing to die just because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic predictions. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard have already been minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I&apos;d stop treatment, she replied that she regrets that, I stop the fight, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> No powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. мартель believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical personnel, for what they have not fulfilled their request, after the team of palliative care eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in dealing with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Alcee Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthetic in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping until his death, or from time to time, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Can&apos;t even pretend that we don&apos;t know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The patients suffering from pain, always say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I wish I had assisted death,&quot; which means &quot;I want, I felt much better.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The establishment of this report was made possible by a grant from the journalistic Research Institute of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system,&quot; опутывающей construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and enforcer. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;the industry, which is very costly to taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;it&apos;s curious how this system breaks down after they were put on the case all means, joked Jacques дюшено, MP and former police chief Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal as a product of the investigation into the misconduct related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean ball, very reluctantly agreed. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;the report дюшено&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, the Ministry of Transport would have kept only one billion dollars in contracts,&quot; if some withheld their instincts to take part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The commission шарбонно &quot;has already shifted two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that she could &quot;open the scheme behind individuals.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="221"> In the case of подключилось created in 2011, the permanent division to fight corruption, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, moreover, the staff of the special unit &quot;hammer&quot; that after the 2009 forced &quot;сточный cartel&quot; Montreal, stop the overstatement of the value of the contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Over the past weeks has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the franc website and ришару маркотту - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The line - Gilles вайянкур, recently retired from the post of mayor лаваля, the third-largest city in the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Неоднократном was suspected of receiving bribes for government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, the indictment was charged several engineers service railways Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony аккурсо and Lino замбито. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last blew a real bomb, after investigators about the &quot;system&quot; of receiving government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For several years, замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, an unidentified intermediary, linked to the mafia, which in turn transferred party mayor жеральда Trembley &quot;joint Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000 &quot;s замбито сорил money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) of the various parties province, mostly liberals who came back in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie нормандо. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts, in which the victors altered the </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, &quot;system&quot; corruption worked flawlessly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles сюрпренан, a former civil construction engineer, described in detail her before the commission: in the ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the matches in hockey and bribes in a total of 736 million dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that were, завышая accounts for 30-40% using fake additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer of the Party mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr Trembley that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of the parallel budget наполнявшего party vault of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations, Mr. Trembley resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal into a deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal, забивших anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of Riviere-de-прэри in the east of the island, she is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal area, purchased for $5 million and перепроданного... for 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> The 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, &quot;she pulls the plug, allowing to understand the functioning of the system, infested ants to stop гангрену and identify the perpetrators.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process she характерезует as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but the city will need its own investigation team and the observer to avoid the return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we убираемся at home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques дюшено notes for his part that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but he was especially worried about the role of the &quot;elected officials who knew about this scheme,&quot; but not participating in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the share of dirty money to finance the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: &quot;while we are not going to strictly limit political spending, in politics are dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of political parties: &quot;we can&apos;t go below; boldly recognized the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. дюшено urges those who laughs, look in your own backyard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you&apos;re in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but may - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Of the great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I&apos;m growing every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also brought a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I&apos;m not распаляюсь. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning, in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in клерфонтене and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you will benefit from the competition set Carlo Ancelotti.... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Topping this summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to what a player like me, wants to be at the level and the place to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He helps substitutes such as Claude макелеле, who played in the same position that I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the owner of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, in the first league, he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have a conversation with him was reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I moved from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust, which he has also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season, Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the first league leader Lyon took place at us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;but we remain ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main goals is the Champions League: we are spectacularly qualifying in 1 / 8 finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to say his word face to face with very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto to be able to accept the return match in one-eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Paris St Germain will become the first European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has a budget for this... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure position in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially from Paris St Germain has the means to make this project a reality. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the first league as last season, will be the biggest failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we are valid ardently wish to win the league title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, it was a disappointment because we had everything to come in first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points assumes the title. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you not think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have the players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully ready for this. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we chose home 4-0 against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder, what the first place people expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement the project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, who already has two seasons fails to pass into one-eighth finals, although they, too, have spent huge amounts of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount invested, we have already represented by 15 points ahead for winter failing. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be a disregard for our opponents and for the tournament in France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; this new Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows just how compelling the first league. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Paris St Germain seems completely dependent on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So what if they say that there is an &quot;златанозависимость.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has scored a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to do this and he proves that he is the star of the first league. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did, it&apos;s really exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others to improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you survived the Euro 2012 against France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> The disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I earnestly wished to participate in this euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> There I have seen many things, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I manage to play a good qualifier matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think of the first months of Didier дешама led blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They effective for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He&apos;s strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires for victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified the US into the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier дешам lead blue to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good deserved the draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to that, the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange based on центробанках numbered transactions between the parties receiving C commission fees on their treatment. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented сатоши Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure the type of exchange protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations have already had registered with 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course биткойна, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before returning today about ten dollars (rates are indicated on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special compared with the global exchange real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Биткойн he describes as &quot;the most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies as &quot;credits&quot; used to advance in a video game that is earned during the game, or that it might buy (and sometimes exchanged). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the operation is always exchange controls and processes of any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The биткойн all nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, покупателыми and vendors. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each deal between two users actually happens between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The set of information relevant to this transaction, signed by electronically, using encryption system with a double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file may check that биткойны used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounting book разосланной across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A key step is the registration of new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks разосланной computers, decided that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> We are talking about hashing phase of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> &quot;computers take&quot; a new transaction and add to her room before the &quot;хэшировать&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number is found, the other sites are easy to check it properly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus нерарзрывно associated with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice the topic, the money, the only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would have remained unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, reward regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited 21 million, but they are divisible to one стомиллионной that leaves still reserve... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task is also increases with the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The sites that provide services Bitcoin, were assaulted and биткойны were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;the protocol used defect does not concern himself,&quot; said Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - payments company accomplishing real money using Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also said of the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash also have this disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their resolve. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that almost 80% биткойнов does not occur in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;the giant sales&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; glad Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which deals with the conversion биткойнов into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre нуаза, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system paytunia, is the equivalent of the credit card (in real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the Bitcoin transactions, thus getting cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner of better control of their personal data and may thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Just tell the address, which can be &quot;photograph and recognize&quot; phone, says Pierre нуаза not to worry, that he has already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend revising the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;before the Bitcoin fixed, it will take some time, but the 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> In its report, the ECB suggests, by the way, to review the various risks, considered today elevated, the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have gone from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (каписа and суроби). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not only on us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Us suffered mostly Afghan farmers, which we are viewed as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and покалеченными. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it did with the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They are tolerated, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will behave more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from bases ниджраб, which I watched from a Hill plantation almond trees thanks to the French credit, took place in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the end of 2014, the Taliban invasion in Kabul would not. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood from the struggle between the various factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid with obscurantism of these peasants, in which their surpassed al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position of dependence. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become dealers, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have discredited; most of them, by the way, not even fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not one of the thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: capital outflows substantial. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world while in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in cities are filled, both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who don&apos;t want to go back to the old мракобесию parties, no to corruption of some of the leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which are of the modern world, and who look everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment, the Army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle is already taking measures to restore the provincial militias who would not abide by the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences must be to some extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> The industry has not been put back on its feet, none of the dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> All the imported; produced nothing, except vegetables and fruits. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by 30 years of war, the state control over the facilities would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It is only strengthened the perception that Western countries were present there, only to their boss. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without the energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It is also necessary to one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls and boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, in an effort to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; and do the impossible, task of combining aid with offensive operations, &quot;civil-military activities&quot; under the Ministry of Defense (cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, with heavy involvement of local labor, could help stem the insurgency: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, the restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and increasing the area of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we leave on the memory of himself, having spent two billion euros on military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget impact would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy has received dozens of written requests on the implementation of the small agricultural works emanating from local communities in Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To get rid of uprisings, led by foreign groups, which want farmers, as I said, we need to give them a small military support, which would be good superivised and came to him directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Egypt&apos;s constitution heavy labor </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all out. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Exactly one week ago, the head of the state Assembly has two additional months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts. </seg>

<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the markets, but there is also need to come, conditionally, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter tooth fell.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> I am now even a couple of кастетов достаю through a person, which I am sure. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He also delivers them only to me, because I know that I&apos;m not rent. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Former military Victor баранец dabbled in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The scheme, he said, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given the album with photographs, where there was &quot;anything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like at the luxurious shop,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to Baranec, does not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, a potential customer, not just buy - we are going with the seller in the forest, there&apos;s set target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that weapons beats good start bargaining,&quot; describes the procedure of the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shop on the couch </seg>
<seg id="699"> The search engines on the Internet posting on sites and groups vkontakte, where the offer to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> For this, do not need any documents and personal meetings. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; writes in the advertising cap on the site &quot;buy a gun battle or machine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> The users leave their applications and asking questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> But minors sell? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;without a license, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (sic) preserved. </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;buy тт.москва&quot; - tersely formulates the query &quot;федоренков.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="706"> The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of secret sites and want to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel. </seg>
<seg id="707"> People go, like a hungry fish on прикормку, and then coal mined in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> The military observer and former military Victor баранец </seg>
<seg id="709"> I heard about such schemes: usually the site registered outside the actions of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People accept orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer through an ATM produces payment. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;in response, send a photo and instruction, where the hidden weapons,&quot; says spokeswoman of the public organization &quot;right to weapons,&quot; Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor баранец argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without arms and get behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of secret sites and want to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;people go, like a hungry fish on прикормку, and then coal mined in Siberia,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov for $100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, we can meet the amount from 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry кислова from the organization &quot;right of weapons,&quot; Makarov can be purchased for 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Will have to wait for a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> He shipped from warehouses long storage management of these warehouses middle managers. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official стастистике agencies, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia fell by 7% and accounted for 22.9 million, while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the United States from Continental supermarkets and fast food </seg>
<seg id="723"> Through the work at the cashier at McDonald&apos;s goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages Walmart Corporation in department stores and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, &quot;&quot; tacos Bell, &quot;&quot; уэндис &quot;and&quot; Kentucky Fraid чикен. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far, no one is predicting, whether this wave in the ninth shaft or fated expire in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares support the unions and a number of left-wing social organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to raising the modest salaries that receive the rank-and-file employees of Walmart and a system of fast food to protest organisers is the creation of the trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy almost not covered union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot; when on America hit orgy of cheap sales with the millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied потасовками. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some workers at Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle-class. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, shotguns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many wage and Walmart come only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and the range of goods made Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pay their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as a shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the shares in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Typical employee Walmart, supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense does not afford, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise salaries to Armenia to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company at 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salary now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, then every visit to the store will do them all by 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protests have occurred only nine states and did not cause any damage малейщего Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;black Friday&quot; continued into its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash registers produced in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The corporation spokesman Dan фогелман claimed in an interview with The Huffington Post left the site that jobs have left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a &quot;stunt&quot; another deadline-slaughtering its union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;fund!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (their this progressive city not nicely, and therefore there is no), and McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald says he sells billions of cabins, and after that he didn&apos;t even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Джумейн Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At this point, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law amounts to $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants to increase over time, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers are in New York, 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less of them in this expensive city not earns no one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can we exist in New York on such money is incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through McDonald&apos;s took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their mystery after school, living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as a main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, I happen upon interviews with workers &quot;макдоналдсов&quot; who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, at the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hangs comment, the author of the notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests that began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald&apos;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the fast-food cooks system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than doubled their current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast food in the area were established trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration is rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But embrace the Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - unusual turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The dissenters </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the action was in the middle of the Day &quot;rally at a McDonald&apos;s near Times Square, which was organized by several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council джумейн Williams, declaring:&quot; McDonald&apos;s says he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de бласио, declaring that &quot;we must join together in support of fast-food workers so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York йоркец!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As it happened, described the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which New York employed tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> While it is unclear whether this will produce spark the flame of the mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;as long as the fool the brain is secondary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, in the summer, at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology laboratory in кэмбриджской Microsoft шарамом изади follows that for scientists this company points - passed. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The prospect of luring manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> &quot;tell me, please, in general terms, what does your team? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the mass of humanity stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья finger at them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox Kinect without today is not for sale, because all the interesting жестовое management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> &quot;what else we lies ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> &quot;despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of the information system (improved gets more data), and the conclusion is not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, working on a true 3D display systems on the basis of different technologies, including проективных. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Need to release a computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> &quot;what do you think about the voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but not overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> &quot;it is definitely not a panacea - the question arises privacy because they don&apos;t always want to notify people about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought over gestures, but not over the swinging and over such parsimonious, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not camera devices and наручным bracelet, which registered movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> While he was big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wrist watches. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, the gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;it&apos;s like? </seg>
<seg id="800"> &quot;for example, how do you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> &quot;I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> &quot;Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - that is, you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment, the car? </seg>
<seg id="805"> &quot;not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future, we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine the reaction of man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give permission for good depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;if you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you claim to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> The resolution lacks the depth or something? </seg>
<seg id="810"> &quot;in principle, the current generation is what we can build on our work on the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it is good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1,000 to a / s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it&apos;s not the мегапикселях themselves, as well as the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds to the work of the designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is, we need to remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y, and z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movement of the person is quite dynamic, and current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen бетишес from our рэдмондской laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between people and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний to FPS was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;and to increase the number of cameras do not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> &quot;Kinect now there are three&quot; camera, &quot;one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver wave crest. </seg>
<seg id="822"> It is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A potentially more cameras could solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in 3-D determining provisions. </seg>
<seg id="827"> &quot;as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You don&apos;t think in terms of the daily use of technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;of course, all the time slob, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here&apos;s what I think: the steep option would be&quot; restricted &quot;keeps reality when the cloud-based platform you could switch with points on a smartphone, a projection screen and further everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points are very personal device, in that their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness is supplemented by reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects, together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony старку from&quot; Iron Man, &quot;but also ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often indicate critics such an idea: no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - in his lectures I often say that amended the reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a kind of substrate for image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is perfectly registers clicking! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are technologies that are really focused on making this &quot;pictures in the air&quot; Mama - for example, several electron beams ultrasound directed to a certain point where the finger, gives a sense of, but so far it is very weak - as if you&apos;re blowing on pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;and you were trying to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;it is a good idea, we haven&apos;t tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task, which is to fight for a long time - how to make the man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - working on concepts and running tracks (not such as in clubs) moving platforms, as well as the huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While the fool the brain is secondary, the work is still very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Minor complaints instead of culture - росбалт.ру </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues to project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; dedicated to the townspeople, which lie ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> At the top the list of prominent figures have already entered the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> A new hero &quot;росбалта&quot; - a pentagram artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, Summer Garden, then at the fort and вернисажах. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The paintings Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Cyril Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical сказочников, the creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Cyril Miller is a brilliant man of the St. Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of his appearance on the streets calling smile among the residents, the resonance the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took at the hands of anything and became St. Petersburg шарманщиком as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Cyril, and why do you still go through the city around the red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose the red color as a fashion designer who views and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world of red is a compromise between the artist, the maker and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society all slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement malign properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at began the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;and when you realized that needs to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> &quot;the exhibition at the theater Nevsky, where my works were displayed. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old free unofficial artists took place, and the new, free like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной that led to the &quot;Pushkin-10,&quot; and more waves. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I get to the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> &quot;and it&apos;s all merged in your art-clinic...&quot; it was important to find themselves at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there has not been repaired, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: номы, tequila-jazz, remember the string led with the project, &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s ear. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in обтягивающем tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band played live, she became the &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Трахтенберг was leading many programs to Khali-галивских times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them трахтенберга, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing he received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; the club &quot;Griboedov is echoes from the art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our employees and patrons left. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Yesterday I hero of the century, when the culture of something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was &quot;the people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;artist of the year&quot; was named I ended my peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the New Times under the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, integrity and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> &quot;your work is characterized by recognizable manner. </seg>
<seg id="884"> &quot;many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and poignancy. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be software exhibition, &quot;the Russian Museum in клоунах.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used social was now to be this is a painful and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in клоунах smeared all the shooting tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a гротесковые ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world by changing the totalitarian наказово. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now meet on clothes, depending on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps, his hand to it and give birth to spit. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed with the dressing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;but recently we saw you in the role of the urban шарманщика. - cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who is not me, they have to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;well may and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people pressed in the pack, eat one loved, простаки more. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now, all crashed on микросообщества, now it is hard to enjoy everything. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I&apos;m not стодолларовая paper to all like. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now need to think who will be like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now each of the cult hero for 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> &quot;but on the Stas Mihaylov comes a few thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> &quot;come on him брошенки there сексо-social sphere works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But on the cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10,000 does not come, and as a result fewer management, money, everything dies. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing is they don&apos;t cheat, not spoil their possessions. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in his youth, such paintings that one collector they on the wall next to фальком and ларионовым hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now, often confuse. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, rose by examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of drawing paintings. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for such a culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Cyril, which lacks the Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing: official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not every one of them can do culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the right tsars, all is not as it was, the Kings may not really understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> This is in Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg that could be the experts, but they closed because they need the higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives вкусовщинка. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same эрарта, but their distinguishes what they honestly say that not all the modern art we accept that there are some artists who must seek to other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> &quot;what is for you - St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital of the far more culture in Moscow, where the soil is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we writers are now more than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> That&apos;s a lot of people in Europe любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We did this layer of subtle. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented on the grant of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with the asteroid-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> The caravans ships with землянами aboard go in search of extra planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, raises the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets that can develop at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;it&apos;s Venus and Mars,&quot; said senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute, P.K. Sternberg (presently), Vladimir сурдин. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on Mars more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations raised on orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, focusing on the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, sent into space eggs перепелок to check how the developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get at the exit is absolutely normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And then begins the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;the problem is related to the fact that this nestling must find a support, he must get back on their feet and start moving,&quot; explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of medical and biological problems (имбп) Ras Vladimir сычев. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in newborns took full atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that through four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;and the two times we вылупляли chicks, then refused because there simply impossible to work with them,&quot; says the failure of the experiment with Birds in space, Vladimir сычев. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time with animals biological &quot;миниковчег&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, at биоспутнике &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> It was an experiment with rats that have been sent into space with the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is not found nothing unusual. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;it&apos;s just been on биоспутниках, but again, this is a single experiment, and such research should be conducted,&quot; said Vladimir сычев. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing at the space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, losing, their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sex drive. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, and able to create an opportune emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> On ethical grounds such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women into space travel is already 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious that humanity, is a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Chaika fled, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether she will give birth to a child after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;after all this question no one answered,&quot; says the veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang вачнадзе. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child андриян Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana савицкой, twice the orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have a few units are astronauts who after long flights all cost, and growing at a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;and if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights,&quot; sums up the cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, humanity to look for new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> CPC гидролаборатория - mandatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the neutral buoyancy astronauts spend skills of work in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If the water for adults, let and comfortable, but still alien environment for infants - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ихтиандры seems to confirm - life on land emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between what the kid is approximately nine months from her mother at окоплодной liquid, then it is easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, runs in just two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;it&apos;s very little to forget something,&quot; says Marina sailing instructor грудничкового pending. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for women - gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, drops the ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Oh well, redesign and it is relying on stimulants generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special chamber to go into labor, she draws nigh. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;and then what?&quot; asks trivial matters Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> With no sense of gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, put into a special load costume for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He simply would be deprived of what he will be essential. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;and this experiment, on which we go with the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground disability, fully дезадаптированного person,&quot; foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics имбп Ras Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space - the question of the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after a while, it will be a reality, when the Earth&apos;s population on their ships go on a faraway planet, which will become home to their descendants born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the unregistered governance: checking Schwartz-system failed at the hands of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good body control and, despite the availability of quality legislation lags behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit Department, from the interview for the site aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;the law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough,&quot; commented on the current situation Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of the improper practices cited Peter нечаса approach to the so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister said the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - it is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;the law should be established in any way, and if he does something, then the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the institutions, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments,&quot; states the feces. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies have you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which was compared the legislation on procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> A parallel test that we started, probably two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question that European law says how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All the information was gathered and, even if there is still unfinished verification, revealed the interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we may be &quot;accurate and unmistakable,&quot; but in practice we have some parameters behind Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows that not enough to create more and more detailed rules need to focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But actually, as this project can help you what it means for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> This is the joint control may contribute to efforts to stop refining laws, reduce and improve the restrictions because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy means getting the appropriate thing for reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system переполнится &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the limit is not declined. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You&apos;re talking about the internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as a system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a such an organization like ours KRU (control-ревизионное management) or it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for the institutions, then there as our Kru is the bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also a board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the powers similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Brh could manage only the federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal registration chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local law, there is easier than we? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can&apos;t definitely say that it is better at everything. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so because they are better at dealing with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I don&apos;t like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Speaking about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force of these amendments are quite short, she still had not surfaced in our work to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since we spend control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take it into account only in the process of preparing the future inspections - we started to use our new instrument &quot;risk detection неэкономности&quot; through which we turned away almost 14,000 state contracts. &quot;we analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will increase because the change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tender and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of the bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that may arise, is that the rules &quot;ужесточатся&quot; and it will be impossible to observe. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> During the action of the previous rules controlled entities are related to the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal error, not influencing the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s realize that this path will not lead anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister said the GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs checks of the so-called Schwartz-system. &quot;what does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be established in any way, and if he does something, then the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies, which compelled to check and to meet its obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;we will apply this law and allow it,&quot; but you can&apos;t say that we will pretend as if nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules on how and what must formally take place, and it is the right thing. It protects public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only for formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads slippery in places, but mostly проходимы. </seg>

<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five players on electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, so far to deal with this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways have always been well prepared for us that surprised me how many times. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the выездам abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you encountered to date? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East still is on a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague in Moscow so many barriers, and here is still in the Bieszczady independent movement of people on an electric wheelchair at the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There is also not in the course of such banal things like give way disabled in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there already are public organizations that are trying to draw the attention of the people on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> But what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are so many things, the level of performance which far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid quite normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, and in this we tap tap them with the slightly ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment when will appear among US athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> While it is isolated cases - people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group tap tap is currently very popular, but back on two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the institute едлички as a teacher, I had a lot of young people who wanted something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, says our leading ладя ангелович, it&apos;s a bit out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I have something steps? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we help that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on advocacy group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if it does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the European Union funds we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> The goal stood in front of you so well turn the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, подражающей one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There is very little rare things, but I dare say that the tap tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this pity completely излишня because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all the abandoned personalities whom we should pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live productive lives and develop, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities something happens, this shift, not only for them, but also for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Lee ensured the success of what you strict head of what many believe you? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the job properly, we must be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that it is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they must go to rehearsals, attend the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, as part of the tap tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were at the beginning of 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one ладя ангелович. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and the will, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will be held at the stadium in Prague Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava fléda - the club is at the center of the plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert all three cities are joined телемостом at the time of the performance of the group&apos;s songs tap tap &quot;the end of the world is cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for educational center studeo when едлички Institute in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Ticket on the concert is worth 400 kronor, for children under 12 years of free entrance. Tickets can be bought in advance at bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and for years took an active part in a number of projects agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to the space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, about the lecture A. штернфельда that December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work &quot;introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Jan гадомский was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, in France штернфельд won the prize of Robert эсно-пельтри and Andre Luiz хирша for &quot;introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan гадомский (1899-1966) mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Гадомский became known worldwide propagandist space exploration, and his contribution was estimated by the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway дрезина equipped missile engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even to disperse or to pull carts would be used rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this дрезине known only from the press of that era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile стрелах. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The study conducted weapons technology section in cooperation with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining material shows that research has reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in the specialized printing an idea фотоэлектрической missiles and fighter, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the next year published work &quot;aerial rocket-powered aircraft and rocket-and-bomb&quot; author леливы-кживоблоцкого. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects of the military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), who coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work by the end of the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the Journal of 1954, &quot;problems&quot; in which four voluminous published articles on астронавтике. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, Professor M. суботович offered to organize a society that will be космонавтикой. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, had already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) attempted to join the International Federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn ooa became its full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The next year, the first chairman of the ooa Kazimierz заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 ooa contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, выполнившей scientific study. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Rocket capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently, was built enhanced version of the RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959, on vacant бледовском were conducted tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome the 14.5 kilometers, and its task was monitoring the rise by the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, the further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Heiress RM became the first missiles missile meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 51 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> The three were developed type (marked as a meteor-1A, -1в and -1с) who were split by the size of the cameras for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Missile meteor-1A had space with 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters and meteor-1C - 0,62л. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range from all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968 for years in the Aviation Institute was developing missiles meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Missile meteor-2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring the cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then were built version of the meteor-2н and meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> We should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, within the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in studies of outer space for the Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision sparked a heated discussions in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that a separate economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no limited movement of private capital, together with unruly financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (wage) raises the price pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept, you need to understand the condition when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to weather the economic competition &quot;misleading&quot; cost competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and thus increase its own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where the cost of labor, compared with other, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including unemployment and for them, the inevitable growing state spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> On the whole, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that it does not need to give specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Бесцеремонные methods of private capital to create economies at the level of individual states situation when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments of their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This reflected primarily in changes of the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to make your Aquapark Aquapark people obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of the rising level of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor who are not able to feed themselves own labor. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occurring cases when employed people receive a salary that the state should they mention that they have received a living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same end, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on the poverty-level wages on the margins of society in the hope that the country will come the private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> However, the question is, where he will undertake? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> It concerns all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the actions of the management of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The following is to answer the question is not whether the private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> With a resounding &quot;yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have a hopeless situation, an emerging of corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in the legislation, where almost everyone deserves punishment, but not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources electrical design bills private law firms, which are closely related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills approved by the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns in such an aquapark Aquapark situation as described аппианом at work, &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies are responsible for the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The bribes, illegal obtaining no favours with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any taboos, and people went to vote with pre-sold voice, &quot;&quot; decent people never ran for the post of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without the consul &quot;....&quot; seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic man.. &quot;аппиан thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced the democracy of autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Today&apos;s result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> It means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy such as can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Above all, the tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social growth. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is to target the political and social reforms that would strengthen the state&apos;s contribution to the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken monopoly position in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;the violence will not, and can never go out,&quot; the Sting, &quot;fragile,&quot; where the main verse рефрена are the words: &quot;do not forget what we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;if my sons did not want war, they would not have been&quot; - a moribund goutelle шнапер, wife меера амшела Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a broad response. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position because he has the right to defend itself, and the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate about who these periodically repeated waves of killings - the perpetrator and victim, in the end, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been witnessing the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve continues for 95 years of tension (apart from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them taken on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is above all, the story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps or for their throne was someone who guided their actions to a pre-set goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and arising out of them, the authorities could not for the life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be regarded as the head of the octopus (don&apos;t know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many of them did not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop the rumors connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to consolidate their power, the growth of wealth or both, and to another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are significant equity stakes in almost all of the central banks of the world, and against the countries whose central banks do not have its share, they lead or prepare the war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the central bank of the Russian government took his country into their own hands. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (понимай) - government money and was assassinated in 1865, in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis макфадден was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their hunger for a world power in the period from 1859 until the 1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created by the great Mason 33-Albert пайком. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and a third should lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a precondition for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the working group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao - order out of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war, by the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne габсбургского Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia&apos;s Bolshevik революциию. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended sudden, economically untenable in the military and the surrender of Germany (already there was no need for a war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the unleashing of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations than created the premise to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then remained the only spark Germans sufficiently strong, обличающего perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, sparking the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Above the Balfour Declaration created the premise for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began to happen the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler extricated himself from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was triggered by the military репарациями on 2-World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed in order to create the hearth of the War of the third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will manage to untie the Jewish people, like in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now, together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only domestically but also internationally (to take only the sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections for their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into world conflict, and given Iran&apos;s control over the latter chokepoint containing 20% of the world&apos;s oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - also will lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Now, in light of the manifest words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;all we need is a general crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in their view is the World Masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy, наслаждающейся comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> World where everyone born body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he becomes a creature who is under total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to have on the right hand or forehead stigma, so that the man, who has not been marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here&apos;s what wisdom: everyone who have the mind can calculate the number of the beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;: when the worse, call the Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, demonstrators crowd of Islamist students captured the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which have been the patron saint of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The US administration for the positive outcome of the situation is not productive - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in a condition. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced an abortive attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days after talks mediated by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck&apos;s &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After some serious troubles they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, helped cover extravagant legend, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the journalists, подыскивавшие in place for the filming of science-fiction epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the expert on &quot;evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation have long been kept, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film аффлека is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film-киноопус,&quot; the story of a successful venture, the scam - example may be a series of films about friends оушена. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (the credits to show significant historical photographs of events and how the same situation were shown in the film - the large differences in this not). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables of negotiations on the staircases institutions on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben аффлеку remarkably managed to make рестарт career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor высмеянного became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;his third feature film, after dark detective&quot; farewell, baby, Goodbye &quot;(2007) and the thriller&quot; The Town &quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film аффлека, who has not appeared in the director&apos;s hometown of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place it refers to the qualities that have heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck and it shows in &quot;Argo&quot; where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of the confusion and непредвиденности that arise when it suddenly changed history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at a Tehran Bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Far too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply many exciting scenes cinematic values. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something further elaborated - there&apos;s all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on a runway look pretty farfetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The downside of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman as the Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they&apos;re in the film is far from the only. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating 1970s thrillers. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But captures with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions about Almighty and всезнающих security services. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules inflate balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com annually conducts the survey about the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce the competition for &quot;the most absurd judgment or the project from the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;we made the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of the large European companies,&quot; said &quot;law&quot; organizer Patrick нагер questionnaire. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the already forward for the nomination абсурдностей - the recent decision by the European court of unification of the premium rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far, the women have benefits for life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively are less vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU, people can advance to the contest until the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will be held before the end of February 2013, &quot;said нагер. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The EU&apos;s controversial orders include, for example, and compulsory Rekreacji Sp adding fuel to that as a result of the harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or the size of the cages for chickens, eggs rose significantly this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;бутербродное butter&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> High-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Pan-European unit often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat of the veto asserts claims its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the lobby are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare show &quot;unusual curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that are complicating trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, despite the resistance of some states still softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, recalling that the existing directive will lead to расточению products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Candidate to win in the poll may become and last year&apos;s ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons must contain a warning that children under eight years could not finagle their without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has asked the American research, according to which the balloons in the game are potential causes of death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That restriction now applies to children under 14 years old, which is prohibited blow at the trade fair дуделки. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Funny ideas are born and at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> It is quite absurd and rule concerning the European officials themselves: anyone who has the EU any official position, cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead talk &quot;FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists &quot;the principle of non-interference&quot; (laissez faire), offered to vote, apart from a few above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule of the amount of food on the territory of the membership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU imposed the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, established by the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of pay and some countries for what they don&apos;t have sea, and the idea is to provide subsidies for the subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;we are at a disadvantage, because we don&apos;t have the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Ask the European Union for compensation, &quot;he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument, he pointed out that the country was a grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying the state had the full warehouses stocks that it was necessary to take out. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development Minister Paul -led German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU: bizarre orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the resolution in member states can easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name &quot;оломоуцкие curds,&quot; but &quot;туземский rum,&quot; a tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename on &quot;туземак.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;горгондзола&quot; марципаном from German Luebeck or Parma ham, has already proved, for example, Karlovy Vary enough погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The EU also trademark can be proud пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие tubes. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to guarded Republic, but I&apos;m a fan, &quot;said окамура. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think about to become a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we in the country all functioned without problems, then I&apos;m not running. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t watch over the past 20 years, the country разворовывается as thieves scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like it, then trying to find a solution, as it change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I have already turned forty years and I am an independent person, not belonging to any party, I don&apos;t have another opportunity to influence things but to run for the post of senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You have got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> So whether you do not turn back to the people who you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that включусь in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I said that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the greatest influence and vast powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not only that we as a nation have ропщем himself in a bar or watching television, but willing to trample anyone who tries to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this, the media that person очерняют and confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri пароубека. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and the back of property declarations to the tune of more than 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do it, you need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You as the president has no such authority, and only the whole Senate may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is playing politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and it holds citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent беспартийного person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I have no party раскладывания through, without looking at the tenets can take each party, what is best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> The Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important - a little bit to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> The question is not about whether someone belongs to the right and to the left, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good for society, whether it will offer hrcm or GFC, and I&apos;m just going against the bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry when someone says you populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But does not prove whether you are what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some good goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And for that you are trying to get closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all the proposals that I am already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics you did not hold on. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, then you will realize the criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them on their side, so that we have achieved the. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, then it would not be a problem to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I will appeal to the president of the parliamentary parties to legitimize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in case of failure, will have to explain why it does not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality that makes the abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Say directly that I&apos;m a lover, not a genius and not intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programs will try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Things I&apos;m trying to promote themselves; if it is not able to finish in six years and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is partly sounds as if окамура must save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> No I&apos;m not the Savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know the one I didn&apos;t make it, so I visited a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with a large amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also I at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan лоренцову, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward his candidacy because people really were dissatisfied, but now I feel myself on the scale. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose members of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Only two of us independent in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections for mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the basis of their own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I haven&apos;t thought about it, because I don&apos;t have time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I don&apos;t have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have the money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You&apos;re talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague, worth approximately 25 million apartment on a 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda white per million, and even a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way Aston-Martin for me because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was a gallant with women and at the same time fought against the meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You travel to Aston-Martin, the owner of the property on 60 million and you don&apos;t have the money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money to invest in it does not want. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I have to get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> The campaign, I have already invested 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign out of pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign I essentially will cover сенаторская salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son for English school, which is worth 30,000 monthly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to just make money, so there would not be running. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So, the next you will be doing business in order to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Don&apos;t you say that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partially reduced its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much, as an entrepreneur, you&apos;re used to receive monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200 and four hundred thousand that get and further. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became president, his business would be finished. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in субботнем issue of the newspaper &quot;right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects MVRDV argue that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example спейкениссе and his newly constructed book Mountains - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think this building fun, it looks футуристично, finally we once again you can see something interesting,&quot; says Lizette верхайг, прохожая on the edge of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> But Stefan спермон, an IT specialist at the nearby large enterprise, said: &quot;no, it&apos;s the building really beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask myself: why do we today, another library? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has the Internet, the iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now no one voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned libraries, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному campus near Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To deal with this unfortunate fact several years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro notes, in the form of richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the city fathers understood that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame the Meuse from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual unflappable, appeared at an audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and winked, sassy Meuse stepped down from his original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project with the words: &quot;dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my proposal: &quot;book Mountain&quot; in спейкениссе, the so-called букенберг! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, this mountain of $30 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several nearby houses and townhouses in a total of 50 flats. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, &quot;the book Mountain&quot; was awarded the second prize competition &quot;The best library of the Netherlands 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project also participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not offer nothing but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades of which suggest a молокозаводе became richer than the one modern piece of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But the most important thing - спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: repetition of Eldorado under Egypt for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is only one elevator that takes place in the center of the mountain, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Остекленное from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is recreated. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> View unwittingly looking benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a big dark hall, typically a comfortless and faceless,&quot; says the blame Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have set the classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inner space book mountains used skillfully: at the center of the offices, the online library, chess club, Environmental Center and technical areas. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Particularly pleasing black bookshelves that serve the finish of the walls, then парапетами, лестничными railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the sophisticated architects and engineers lost at guessing what the unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;we are eager to work with secondary materials,&quot; explains Joop трауборст, head of the project, representing the community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> A thin textile serves one or two of the season, then it can be throwing. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> The library for this painting - for the first time in such quantities - was спрессовано panel of four centimetres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, according to smell a little like a new car and a little sneakers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The top of the lead 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Anyone who breaks the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded at the literary cafes not only a fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch крокетами and baptized фикусами in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the environment, and primarily about the proper humidity on literary grief. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The cost of a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;it&apos;s hard to believe, but it is building, despite plenty of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology,&quot; says троуборст. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> It is used for heating and cooling warmth of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book Gore is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Large farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass case, provide shade and take up most of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room a very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller-blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan спермон, mentioned earlier skeptic from the IT sector, has already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lizette верхайг also was already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also teaches traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia богард, which called the &quot;soul букенберг спейкениссе, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from the permanent collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is still not fully staffed libraries - at that time it was 70,000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are laden top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;there is nothing worse than полупустая library,&quot; says the architect blame the Meuse. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation now each resident in some way connected with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task that at a professional jargon called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Спейкениссе wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And if they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for building identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans must play a more important role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow the diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that the U.S. position she also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence is not speaking too critical against Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of the forbidden zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> As a result, NATO has conducted this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is so. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The thing is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, led by the United States, with the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only track their role, but we are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> So what exactly does &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy with the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is the willingness to hold the position in their national interest unaffected by the position of the United States or the European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are largely different from the interests of other large states, and why Germany must defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Influenced whether these economic interests at the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not take it too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even the United States dominated the understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think that it was the same dramatic надлом, both in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany will thus a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, clearly favours a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> On the strength of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration at heart has sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as it always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I notice that Obama is not Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot act as part of a wider approach and have to instead to act on its own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is how they come with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> The issue has always been a sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she would take a really major role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the leading role still struggled Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not accustomed to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far has always struggled to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - when Germany takes an important role, lends itself to a variety of boycott feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans are not just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, this is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a more precarious position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment, the EU is not fill this vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like, unpleasant or strengthens the dislike for you - that&apos;s life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, the institute, in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly explore the problems of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, clogs, a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic ties. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;the protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is the world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is the Armani polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is officially registered in China, the name that has nothing to do with companies, on which it was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But even then, it is unclear whether they defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;foreigners is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas паттлох, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights to trademarks in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Имитаторам enough to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci, Prada instead can be registered Prada-kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied by German companies, such as sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Паттлох opens the folder with records office registration of trademarks in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> What the Chinese are world champions, copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities have a multilevel department stores that sell almost exclusively of forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, no such cases паттлоха. On behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the agency the right to use the name of the registration of trademarks, which is already protected somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;ban минпай,&quot; Mark-passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is associated with &quot;ban дакуань.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The so-called the women who hunt for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;it damages the business, with this, we must fight,&quot; convinced паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;while the brand, the unique position is lost, the image wobbles precipitously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Паттлох tells about the cases in which the court dismissed several claims, because after a long time опротестованное name became &quot;the reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору as damaged his trade sign in China, says паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes is ruled by law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous case of graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely bought Volvo company initially used the blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Fashion goods maker Lacoste имитаторам lost in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year was &quot;the return of the emergency situation in the working process to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the amount of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Such cases were closed nearly 140 millon, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> With this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As very often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It is a record and means that China is the tenth consecutive topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, it paid $1.8 billion yuan fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If we simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Her appeal is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group is fighting against the Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans managed to achieve what the illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator cemented its Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was his own omission, because the names in Germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical setting in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks ctmo мюнхенцев rejected the claim. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both of the following sets Freudenberg won, but the stronger side continues to struggle so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Need to be on guard </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now, the question is pending in the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Вентцлер hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Domestic spending is unlikely to yield accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, vain Freudenberg suggested the opposite party &quot;greater шестизначную amount in Euro&quot; for a settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;this makes it clear how expensive it is to us,&quot; says вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The danger of the Far East threatened to break even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> But if the simulators register there the unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;we need to be vigilant,&quot; says вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international law on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be &quot;all in any way is worth protecting, the Register also in China,&quot; says вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if the Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the commercial sign, it will have to pay the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise, we will push the market in the dark segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: притоптывать, sing, to help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The history of relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> At first heard stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, pumps ladies and gents wear slippers паркетном rhythm on the floor and quickly find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only after that slowly growing voices of singers - Alt, the bass, the tenor and soprano - they occur, enchant and follow each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And фите хопф, 29-year-old conductor, almost gets out of their матерчатых shoes when leads them flexible and expressive gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg имбонги choir rehearsing a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty members of the choir rehearsal came from 23 to 69 years old, from специалистки on human genetics to Porter. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;om&quot; обани &quot;is no easy thing, every voice choir has its text, also on a completely prima facie alien language: зулусском spoken eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some parts. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Self help for </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> A 23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland has 245 000 orphans of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> The more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of эситжени Association voices for Africa found bosses in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend school, готовящую to further training. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the patronage. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo-center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> The имбонги зулусском language means narrator or восхвалитель. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this hall is not fluent in the Bantu, but know how to sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nearly ten years choir разучивает songs on this another soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first emerged: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After all, at a distance from хайдельберга 8733 kilometers of the summer, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland is эситжени village, which depends on the votes of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent of the infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus -ic. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The эситжени in miniature reflected the disease only Swaziland: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population is almost not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of Swaziland&apos;s population are the human immunodeficiency virus, the death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants имбогни saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but just barely: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without the school education a person in a poor country, there is no chance at all. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was a private commitment of individual participants - a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get hot meals. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later, the choir founded the Association &quot;voices for Africa,&quot; which has since almost professionally takes care of orphans of AIDS in эситжени. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The facts about the infections, sexually transmitted </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important disease, sexually transmitted infections? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Attributed to the bacterial STDs syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (триппер). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human папиллома-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Лобковый педикулез and scabies belong to паразитарным STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main поражаемые group? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Among heterosexual adults commonly seen diseases in sexually transmitted infections are хламидийные infections, трихомониаз, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-virus. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the youth хламидийные infections are significantly more often than among other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European sources, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> We among young people also often found human папиллома-virus. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> As changing the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all of the disease, sexually transmitted infections are subject to compulsory registration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections in 2007, declining. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is about one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> When infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, the complaint during urination, selection, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or sealing. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and through close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The early diagnosis can be cured most STIs and avoid the remote consequences. </seg>

<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says аннете леннартц, &quot;because he is linked to sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King мсвати III, known for his love of largesse. </seg>

<seg id="1780"> A little to support the cultural exchanges, the choir ибмогни every two to three years, is traveling to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale and confidence and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the days of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that happened, provoked tears to the eyes of harsh border guards. </seg>

<seg id="1787"> &quot;the probe messenger&quot; found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The thickness of the ice sheet may have up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although it is the closest to the sun, there is also a frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> &quot;the probe messenger&quot; found evidence that is located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid confronted with the mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one connects the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, &quot;said chief scientist Sean Solomon probe. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature at Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these findings could help explain how the water and other building blocks of life transferred to other places in the solar system. </seg>

<seg id="1834"> The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans липперсгеем - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began monitoring the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes became more and more available - and their view of space deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope, &quot;part&quot; of the Observatory паломар near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, is &quot;big бинокулярный telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;the Grand Prix телескопио канариас&quot; has a gigantic inner workings - diameter mirror alone accounts for 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> &quot;the big South African telescope Mirror&quot; in South Africa сегментировано - for the sake of reducing the cost. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless in diameter, it reaches about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope rigidly 37th under vertical angle is limiting his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope &quot;Hobby-эберли&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His feature: high светособирающая ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirrors - the parameters of the world&apos;s major telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space. </seg>

<seg id="1855"> In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install the European &quot;very large telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should раскинуться by as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the photos are not to be expected before the year 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, both &quot;Keck telescope in Hawaii volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They installed two mirror with a diameter of about ten meters. </seg>

<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not before the year 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: he must in light of the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists suggest that at the South Pole of Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no reliable data about this, so as a &quot;messenger&quot; moves closer to the north pole of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements over the decades pointed out that at Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the running in 2004 зонду &quot;Messenger&quot; - the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now believe in it. </seg>

<seg id="1881"> The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men are still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Minibus with tearing rumbling rolls along a winding road past the overgrown with dense forests hills, gushing rivers and simple peasant houses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is so green and bright, that you might think that are in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are fluent in Farsi and азербайжданском differ and longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> The final point is лерик. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> A small town flaunts too ponderous Soviet-era architecture that is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The tourists from Europe almost didn&apos;t come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too утомительна. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> The 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Legendary wealth, which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not gotten. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that лерике have something of interest for tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;in May, Baku became famous festival song contest - and next year we will host a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here the documented biography about eight dozen Talysh of these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he is 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years he was born another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder ширали мюслюмов, who allegedly was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Certificates of birth, however, is not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> But the fact that the oldest person whose age is documented, the age of 122 years, age мюслюмова seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;he was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; explains фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> A man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, aged 136 years he allegedly was born daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So whether sheep herder мюслюмов added a couple of decades to his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;surprisingly, many elderly people can be found in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia also lives very many very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to a lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because it did not have the civil status registers. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of baked oil </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of лерика strikingly often reach biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now here has 20 people aged over 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the South, so many livers? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani guide Farid мугимзаде explains this specific genes Talysh. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the Museum of фатулаева, by contrast, believes that the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysh like meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drinking on стакану baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a higher calorie content diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or the case in primitive lifestyle that keeps people youth? in ченгемиране, a tiny village near the town of лерик, lives рубаба Mirzoev. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In the 97 years she is still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Мирзаева, which claims that she 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here are living under the same roof eight people, including one of the sons and daughter мирзаевой, who has already have their grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby are jumping the two children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied армуду cold glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The мирзаевой perfectly aligned and sturdy white teeth, under the head kerchief, she hides long dark-blond braids that her son proudly opens before us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always my hair milk, so that they never pull out and saved the color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;and I never used shampoo,&quot; says мирзаева. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pensions enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For all my life I have never bought the products in the store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was most difficult after the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it has become better when &quot;beloved father, Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is not often heard in speech of the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son, Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, among the Azerbaijani elders there is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 manats (roughly equal to the same amount of euros) мирзаева receives a monthly pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, long-raised son мирзаевой also is right: &quot;old people in our culture are deep respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> What is not the reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is not in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep rift in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution based on sharia, met fierce resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president also had pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was converted to all people, but especially to the Christian коптам, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented into nonplussed opposition, fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate in American University of Southern California, not entirely clear Egyptians and the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles have managed to smuggle into the night 15-hour jump configured with obstacles on the Islamic Constitutional Convention of 100 participants, and it is partly raises concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the trial is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does it mean &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least it suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should be encouraged to the Council of the University of al-ашар, crucial Islamist institution of the country with great authority in Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but may mean that the clergy enforces laws that de-facto would result from the limitation of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts during Mubarak&apos;s government served to suppress the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family,&quot; and &quot;maintain its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is legally formulated so vague that public institutions with the help of this article can control even the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Open text, it means nothing but censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But the other prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also questionable is the wording that prohibited &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to be caricatures of the president or jokes about правоведа? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation, like much of this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and who, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; Egyptians will be submitted to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;the revolution is back.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> For several weeks, is formed by the opposition against the superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;the revolution is back, and we&apos;ll win,&quot; said хамдин саббахи who came in third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed el-Baradei said the draft constitution place &quot;on the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> A short news service Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi desire to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;if he declares referendum, we will go to his palace and скинем him,&quot; said opposition figure Yasser said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers have not отмщена,&quot; he quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many of the judges also said they do not want to observe the referendum, which would have made him invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;the Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> &quot;the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for opposing demonstrations, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters who shouted: &quot;the people of God requires the application of the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded from Morsi: &quot;очисти country!&quot; and assured: &quot;the Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2058"> &quot;my government says the people of Mexico its willingness to deal with violence,&quot; said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Such statements until next to the president&apos;s political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed&apos;s tenure as governor of his home state of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital of the country, divided opinions about the new leader. </seg>

<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman, and, above all, the man who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in another part of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The municipality несауалькойотль, also known by the name of Ciudad ment, is the most startling contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under эстакадами highways, he is in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are too severe nature of this metropolis. </seg>

<seg id="2089"> In this, they said, was denied this family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;the state officials appealed to me as with the old сплетницей, discontented нарушительницей calm. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want the people just took on faith what they say and помалкивали. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben наваретте believes that the American-born Mexicans caught between the two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall to arrive, approached the border control zone, and remained in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to the two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for the piece (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my whole life called Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I focused on the complex structure, &quot;Mexican American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> &quot;I was just American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took his U.S. passport and was in line for the piece. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> President Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but there was no concrete proposals. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, relations with the United States - heavy and recorded old grudges question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico rifles at gunpoint and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So it is worth only any U.S. statesman обмолвиться even a word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex are Mexico&apos;s relationship with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Do you want to talk about insults? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Their enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find themselves in this country for the opportunities, and those for whom there is no such opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most of those were Mexicans of a certain type - complexion, education, from poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember about it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, it see differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and got into the good work, but we should not forget that even this dream is an American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination запутано and unclear, but we know what the country considered his. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class, we do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We answer them the same. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, as the Mexicans inauthentic. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not well speak Spanish, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them because of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not now for silk curtain, finding in the US smug life, but having lost the spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even as a child, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are certain tensions - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is a shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States have called the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans of Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how cool her visit, and would be able to convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe this country so great. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, check. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If a fraction of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they interact with Mexico half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in deep offense for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes it. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle on the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Agreement on a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas group may become a fragile foundation for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Prospects for a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound that became familiar, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings reduced to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, fired from Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its извечном conflict in the Middle East came changes. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be treated differently, but the events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; закружили in rebellious storm many established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians have not managed to stay away from the vortex, shaken the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed that occurred this week, clashes only strengthened the security forces on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, protesting against what they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred by them. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is ramping up its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The victorious Hamas supporters say about creating around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon in the north, which governs the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels overthrew the rule of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the King Power threatened by allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the movement of the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention to the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization is largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;hard-line&quot; in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the abandoned Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence in the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections set for January 22 - merged with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very efficient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What sense condone the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you give into their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from the rockets toward Israel, as their brethren in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and pass on any attempts to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the supporters of the &quot;hard-line&quot; victorious; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries that are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, the combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism, president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not less, must take into account the long-term consequences of their policies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the onset of democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the occupied territories, like the bus, взорванному in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For the bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay the growing discontent with the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need in the external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It remains the only solution to which relentlessly call sensible representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two states and territorial concessions by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope is that not too impressive in the short term, &quot;the hope that the cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which has long time to make the decision to block the arms into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have as ever in the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, with land swaps and sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The other Arab countries should also make efforts toward reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming ballot at the UN, the result of which may become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Their role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, must play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he never presented a plan for a peace settlement. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he still shows the reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is disastrously недальновидная position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australia came into force, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The warnings about the hazards of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts contrast stand on a damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice Australian law on the same pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color design different brands of the same box of the gloomy and olive color with the terrible images of affected parts of the body, and images of children smoking health which undermined by their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Besides the various images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed the mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the world&apos;s most stringent conditions for registration of the packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit fashion status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> On the basis of this decision was based on the results of the research showed that people who do not smoke began to 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging,&quot; explains health minister Tanya плиберсек, citing a study by that, for example, the crown logo in children is associated with the idea of the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not affect the profits of multinational corporations, however, are already considering the possibility of taking such measures and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, which would be sold cheap and accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought it was initiated,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to the High Court of Australia, where he tried to appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, it is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among precisely that part of the population, which sent these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> In Australia after the passage of several laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibit cigarette sellers display in a prominent place, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;if you sell tobacco and you are left with only this small light, the idea is to promote their products on the Internet looks like a very attractive,&quot; explains Beca Freeman, examined the issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on brand names written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether it is the work of the average citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare no effort and time and made the video, or behind this advertising campaign? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adapting to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that the trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are very slight. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Decision of the WTO is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya плиберсек, the government has discussed with the other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory posting photos, warning about the hazards of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is usually taken in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures of me without touching. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;just выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь pack in his pocket,&quot; explains Viktor Al Haig who buys cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor at the mouth of either. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me give up - this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the problem of goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;before I left the unloading of the new party, an hour, and now four hours,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;the government should have to take and not ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, OK, it&apos;s over, shut up shop,&quot; he says, вскидывая hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it&apos;s not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because of our aircraft revealed the mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we and waited. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I&apos;m not going to lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it&apos;s really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, nor the iPhone, nor even the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But in recent years, more and more scientists and experts on child development support in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that might encourage creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because in the modern world, we are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time, not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to it. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention of the times, when people got more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> This is not so, says Peter ait, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;actually boredom boasts a very ancient history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> It remains an open question about how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Numerous studies on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;want to, but they can&apos;t deal with the fact that they would bring a satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that скучающий man is not doing something that I wanted to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Nothing to do with apathy do not want to. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a &quot;violation of the attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time goes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The description of the boredom may seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these conditions скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to concentrate on something. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study, &quot;the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the previously conducted an experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could barely read, and a third group was listening only to record the voices without sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard a low-volume, noted that they were bored, more than others, they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention may cause weariness, says Mark J. фенске, associate professor of neurology at the University of гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное, &quot;for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he said that when people start покачиваться on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually such actions not just help relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;the study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight,&quot; said Professor фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments, we experience boredom: when a flight delay (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching the film uninteresting. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However, different people have different levels of the propensity to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers have developed a special &quot;scale of the propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, &quot;much of what I have to do, monotonous and chant&quot; or &quot;me too much fun, so I don&apos;t have time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that bored boys more than girls, &quot;says Stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there is a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However, in general, teenagers are often bored. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted via pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they are bored at school and at the time of the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> At the same time, only 3% of parents said that they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, he knows that &quot;in adolescence have the propensity to boredom,&quot; mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully resolve than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Go back to my original question: boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes no, because she was in extreme cases, studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor воданович dedicated to the study of the problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;so our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is the boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However, this is the brain does not always knows what to do better. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you&apos;ll be bored and you will receive this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he will miss, but he did not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way to manage their time and employment, &quot;said Professor фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;these skills and self-regulation used in various situations,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to occupy themselves something, he also learns control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think the boredom need to somehow praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, it considered something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees with this. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in the modern world, we are accustomed to constant over-stimulating the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when the silence, we don&apos;t know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is unclear how the new law will apply the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, Nineteen-player football team and the student community college in the south-east of Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and rode in a car across the prairie near the border with канзасом when they were stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda to the court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use is a minor offences for each of them had a fine of $100 dollars - and set the date for the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;with US treated as criminals,&quot; says Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But whether he criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends not so much from the law, how much of the place of consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, have already been charged in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped charges people at the age of 21 years and older for possessing small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain regions of the West vote to avoid the appearance of their places of new state shops licensed to sell marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;all this is growing so fast that I don&apos;t even know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also озадачено почесывают heads. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will form a licensing rules to determine the order of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all that needs to be done before 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes at first, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;in Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; explains Brian and. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now, no one can do more to recognize Mr. Smith than to put forward any proposals and hope that it would work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;we have no real precedent on which we could navigate,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when there are no state licensing system, and the right to possession of marijuana has been institutionalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And because there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of &quot;adequate access&quot; to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;it is especially difficult to place the licensed enterprises for trade in marijuana in the inner cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly-established research group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora to subordinates sent an e-mail message that the city prosecutor&apos;s office no longer attract the persons who have reached the age of 21 years, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations &quot;from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Police chief Oates said that the police would monitor the observance of the rules governing the activities of individuals planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors would still be liable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage use of its people to undergo treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;the duty of our institutions - pursue for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,&quot; said Mr tank in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where the voting members rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges already open cases involving custody of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that enforce the law until he won&apos;t change is our duty,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of residents of the state of Colorado, took part in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> A controversial reaction of people in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity attitude of local authorities to experiment with marijuana in the state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;the district prosecutors on this issue, there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains Sean макалистер to have a lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;they&apos;re so long persecuted people for it that now can&apos;t really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as to alcohol is destined to become the experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time, they are cautious awaiting instructions from the federal authorities who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Justice Department would cede on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite a number of high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients reported using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases made good on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> The agents of the Bureau of anti-narcotics are unlikely to be interrupted at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become blind eye on regulated by the authorities of the state recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on anti-drug in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores selling marijuana, and so could not open up sooner than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the монтроуз, a city in the western part of the state, put forward by the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;we don&apos;t want to be in this position that we will issue the license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and voted for that state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There is still a lot of unresolved issues. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Петронелла уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for what I&apos;m conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> The persecution of university students for their views not started today. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As long as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best in the world, the institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And yet, after two weeks of training on вустерского college history at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father did not survive and burst into tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> The friends were are bewildered. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I threw college because I didn&apos;t like that my classmates have sex in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a Shcherbatykh cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> In fact, it was not so funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran because I was systematically hounded and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I attended a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was hounded for only one reason, and in this renowned cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow уайэтт, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a follower of conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You ask, why should remember about it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, a new generation of students, reinforces center-right views, is subject to the same kind of harassment. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as one that is provided by the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say their &quot;often actively isolate put personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to enter into a committee on equal rights of the college alternate representative to ensure freedom of expression. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on BBC Two documentary about politics in the students&apos; environment, &quot;the land of miracles: young, smart and right-wing,&quot; in which the Conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The film was shown Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drives a Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Students at other universities-conservatives complain that they are doing &quot;scapegoats for higher fees for their studies.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2429"> The people who we don&apos;t even know beforehand believe us bold and unpunished unruly children of wealthy parents. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history department at Corpus Christi College, which was filed the petition on strengthening the protection, calls such an atmosphere &quot;неуютной&quot; and Stephanie черилл, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the members of the student club number center-right views dramatically worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;it is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate or simply to normal life of members of the club,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came back in September 1986, timid and shy восемнадцатилетней girl. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Oxford лихорадило from hatred of the Conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The year before, the university voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even Revolutionnaire. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt what awaited me ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I didn&apos;t know that teachers not only looked through the fingers at a hunt-conservative students, but also gladly took part in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The political issues - the miners&apos; strike, privatization and opposition of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - seeped through the walls trimmed wood panelling audiences. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> On my first workshop I needed to translate the text of the eighteenth century French into English, and I was not prepared for what followed it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;miss уайэтт,&quot; said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text was me with difficulty, I hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face like a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;тэтчеристы fundamentally not taught French or they simply don&apos;t have enough brains?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students захихикали. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> In my eyes were full of tears. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society,&quot; - пробрюзжал Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room is absolutely miserable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, a second-year student at the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Association of University. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said friendly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;unfortunately, the is as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Over every who is suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives, will scoff. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> I was very easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the freshmen and conservatives pretend that they Labour. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I timidly tried the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that it does not agree with everything he says Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The trick failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: &quot;you&apos;re the daughter of the fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contagious. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students picked up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was worn, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;as the Conservatives have sex?&quot; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;they&apos;re колотят each other, right?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Can I ever to live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or do I have to meet with like-minded only under cover of night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Will I be forced labor and conceal their true beliefs? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Coming to me three years began to seem hell, full of temptation and loneliness. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In college, he did not appear. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-детерминистскому view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of билкент in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;here you will not be happy,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial Metropolitan friends. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He didn&apos;t believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in the 1940s there were any political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;but it&apos;s the best university in the world,&quot; he said plaintively. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;there is not capable, not only in the city of dreaming spires.... </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes помутнели. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;do not pick up any hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it&apos;s just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You&apos;re разобьешь my heart, if the university matter. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was crafting regular visits to London and my emotional defense ultimately collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a conservative, unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> Next week during the seminar, when the next history teacher quite seriously called me &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The burning with shame, I admitted that &quot;I was brainwashed brains parents,&quot; and called them &quot;old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford, was destined to score my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the same time, he every week wrote two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I did not appear, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never went back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me плаксой and cloth. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But the eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Even sadder that it was the Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers Tories, but to this day is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence. </seg>

<seg id="2557"> In four euro Indonesian miners risking life and limb, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulphur on top of the volcano on steep trails combined </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work - hell, while others literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them are the Zaporizhzha виджайя, one of the 400 miners who earn a living prey of sulfur into the volcano кавах-иджен, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day the Zaporizhzha comes down to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Отколов huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which may reach 70 kg, he puts them into two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets on their shoulders and brings up the precipitous rocky road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Up to the top of the volcano that is 39.411 meters, just 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам takes more than 40 minutes to climb snail&apos;s pace, with difficulty holding the balance and carefully нащупывая road to not оступиться and not fall over the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened with one туристкой from France, which started a few years ago with rocks кавах-иджена. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, they pave his way between the tourists who photographed them as if they were the most notable of the circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about 95 Kandy нгримби, the company, which operates in 1960, the volcano and it is better not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;since the norm is переноска 70 kilograms, we earn about $46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each ходку,&quot; explains US antonyms, which usually carries three daily carry. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours for each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems мизером for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more of what he would have earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;поденная miners fee is very high at local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains Porter, who previously bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the plot was not as dire, but the Zaporizhzha баньюванги returned with her family in a small town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing as sulfur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to the Jawa, converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he слезятся eyes because of toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In his 27 years the Zaporizhzha spent three years, risking a кавах-иджене, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the availability of masks and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he слезятся eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;it&apos;ll go for another two years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises a more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, the waiter or the doorman at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Dividing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to flow at night when her distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging the shadows, the Zaporizhzha descends into the crater, covering a small flashlight, подсоединенным to his Cascais, which he bought for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters being dragged baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, the mining company will not mechanized extraction sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам who work at their own expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not get even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for taking photos, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his men and mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;this work for cattle, and not for the people,&quot; says бадрусин, stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on кавах-иджене three decades, ever since I left college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he insists he will accept the job &quot;as much as you can,&quot; because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burn burned by the throat and eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about his severe illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which деформировались under the weight of Corzine. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Hovering basket on his back, унайник now only can raise the 50 kilogram in his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which carry three trucks at a warehouse in тамансари, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the swamps. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; says унайник, widely opening her mouth, which lacks a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works as a carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do human mules with кавах-иджена. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans accused career, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;the people of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> My husband Patriot, you are my wife патриотка to fulfill our civic duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - it&apos;s the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying something like &quot;let&apos;s put Bao (булку) in the oven&quot; to laugh at birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency that has made this video, BBH to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people fulfilled &quot;its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world for the renewal of their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government tried to do many things, such as the launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-visits). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative thing of the possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The child 1.2 </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not take it so lightly, so it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It is spending $1,300 a year on politics for the enthusiasm of citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging pregnancy and maternity leave and provides tax breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has a low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and its strict social control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national governance on the population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Office of population, says the reason is &quot;improved education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;this allowed people to have a wider range of options in life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and creating a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms, help increase the number of Bachelorette and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at the sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who were criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore&apos;s ruling party has got the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> The unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While falling fertility has a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation&apos;s tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to not built so many small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Guidance on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments area of 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute холостому lifestyle and deprive the incentive to developers who want to build a big family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the company showed El developers, says that their &quot;boxes of shoes&quot; sold much faster than the more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flow increases. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers who earlier put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Is too перенапряженные </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with сингапурцами who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;people are very stretched, expensive housing and education, and because of this, many people this delay,&quot; says the young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;but for me, it&apos;s important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and prices for housing and education as factors that hinder them to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, how would the government nor even encourage their citizens to the birth of children in childbirth, the final word rests with сингапурцами. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The personal is offline - personal online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, we are talking about private property or the &quot;sphere of personal life, which have the right to defend against any invasion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> That is a personal for a minor under 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> As he uses this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Whether he understands the danger of being when discussing the Internet situations that would probably not shared outside of the Internet? </seg>

<seg id="2659"> I started Twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know whether to meet me, I only their load,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;social networking is entertainment, I can talk with distant relatives or with friends-quick,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Without thinking, says that would never accepted a request from an unfamiliar faces. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Wouldn&apos;t be with someone who recommended that a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of the 14-year-old Jose is. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager there are open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest admits he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;it doesn&apos;t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in confidence and not asked his home address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;if the pressure will be on me or require simply remove them from their account,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known as кибермоббинг. </seg>

<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, not deleted account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;the only included confidentiality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a safe way. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos or конфузных acquaintances into uncomfortable situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would have done it, if the person I don&apos;t like it or if I want to. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;although I know it кибермоббинг,&quot; he confirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Марьелос поррас, who teaches English and expert on education and training, said that in order to guide the children and teenagers need to understand that the purpose of social networking - inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Поррас indicates that Professor Mark пренски, Master of Education from Yale University and the author of labor digital natives and immigrants who invented these terms to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They are digital natives, children and young people who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we are still learning about themselves,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can or can&apos;t distribute, publish or speak, at age when not mature enough for that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;also that they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show what the privacy of children and adolescents, &quot;ask questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;tell them that they are not doing this, useless,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then поррас lists some options: there are things that you&apos;re not told a stranger, so why do you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have liked it if published a photo of you like the one that you published about his friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish about you? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign photos with parties, ask whether you&apos;re letting other people to celebrate their? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more thing, all I need to know what you are doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to let them understand that they must behave online just as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be on social networks,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The vigilance of </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Эстуардо гуардия, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need to the heads of families conscientiously read the policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding the each of the items, they have good grounds for talks with children about the preconditions for opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;for example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans &quot;were killing each other during the second world war,&quot; and in other clashes, &quot;but now they are almost one fatherland.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2746"> Those who lectures, never undertake any obligation, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States,&quot; he said, hinting at the political asylum given Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said he does not regret the decision, because with him it&apos;s not betraying their principles, and honors the &quot;deepest values of democracy and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that there were &quot;certain suspicion that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be respected the process.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2751"> Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he was a pulmonary problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian head of state. </seg>

<seg id="2754"> &quot;it affects the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that the negotiations were in London on finding a solution to the problem in the confines of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We are not negotiating about human rights, is a word in this case, we do not use, but there were constant debate. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;the solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, leads a number of processes in various European institutions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And argued that &quot;if the United Kingdom tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases to be examined by Senor Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or be examined him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that &quot;does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the main enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-policy, and bad journalists supporting speculative, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality,&quot; because in reality, &quot;it has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian president considers, moreover, &quot;perfectly legitimate&quot; desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos now lead the negotiations with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime borders between the two countries after the decision by the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which turned out in favor of Nicaragua&apos;s maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment, this decision is not observed. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute over maritime borders, who are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that &quot;the right thing for Latin America to turn to the international court if the two countries agree to accept the decision, no matter how difficult it may be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Regarding the ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, though sometimes it&apos;s pretty hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if it loses the election in February 2013, the disappearance from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;my political movement decided what I guaranteed the probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In case of victory, it would be my last term in office of the president, and then we move out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;this decision,&quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Denmark, who told me that he had gone for treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will miss a campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;it does not mean the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he explained. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I was like a stunned,&quot; he recalls that difficult, despite all the rhythm of the doctor&apos;s time. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Having decided to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible, and his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; HIV patients of the hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with a diagnosis &quot;of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe when there are too few treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Thus, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he was cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days have AIDS was the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without reducing quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;drained&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported, the &quot;great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the Department of HIV-HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when a reported 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years old,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; nevertheless, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> &quot;why so far there are deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I think it, so the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least for the past 12 years, we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients are coming very late, because they do not know about his инфицированном condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He cited the devastating data: &quot;nine out of ten patients come when we already have some оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate is to conduct the diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal agree experts and officials of the State Council on prevention of AIDS in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check into a private laboratory, motivated by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that will die, and don&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;time still die, the better I&apos;ll be надираться three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I nourish myself, doing the exercises, take drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents only know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I conduct an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility to take care of yourself and of another person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with Milenio Jalisco to be influenced by talking to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let the checked if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The counter condoms </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Big gap between programs in health and simple citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who started a problem related to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places dedicated to this task, &quot;actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now we give packages hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still does not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;why are you?&quot; is a popular issue with ехидством and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and health care workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the communicator. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only hundreds of them, and that was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when he was asked how there can be distributed condoms under his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;it&apos;s not sexy, it&apos;s best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The key data халиско </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Registered 13,435 (12,158 total cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state ranks fourth place in the national rankings on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13-th on HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to перинатальному path. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, because on the one known case there are 4 to 5 people who don&apos;t know about it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision that elides debt restructuring group Vitro garnered through competitive manufacture in Mexico, the script sets the fatal precedent for any national company with branches in neighboring country, which has a problem of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms that дозволены Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practical sphere, the approval of the decision on June 15, Judge speaking Hale bankruptcies in the Court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firms in the face of a possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the ruling opens the door leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing as proof of the three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that lenders should be regulated by the U.S. bankruptcy code, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive manufacture, considered in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first item involves the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the model law was created by the UN unification of the rights of international trade, determining as an arbiter of the American Institute of Law. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Second, the verdict states that vote without межфирменного recognized in a critical mass of competitive manufacture debts that were in front of the parent company Vitro subsidiaries would not have been achieved majority needed to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the accepted this scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, among whom agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose межфирменные debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, somehow Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds &quot;vultures&quot; like aurelios capital, aurelios way, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, does not have a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> These data drops the appeal court. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with whom she has faced since 2008, concern raised serious economic crisis, who flee the United States, stabbing across the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> So far, the family firm Gonzalez garden would appeal the decision by the court of appeal to the vote came to its plenary session of the five judges, in view of the fact that only three votes. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the case of our failures will be charged the identity, which would require a review process on the part of the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of ewcs curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), in which he described the process, which should be Vitro within the framework of the law on competition matters, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to associate it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, noted that the country is bowing to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules set for interstate insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2872"> &quot;basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long journey to testify about it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The heart баямон </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the largest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of his performance in the role of co-agent or agent contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, a year of Jerome Minsky&apos;s debut in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, and continue to lead became &quot;куко&quot; Ortiz, who was a great manager, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember Jean бартов, who arrived here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have for you, there is a very strong player who stands 6 &apos;7.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;do you want?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And it was the beginning of the Minsky, one of the best players who were in Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Бартов then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and has become one of our best scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that said that if Minsky brought the championship баямону, гаусс would help win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The Cowboys чемпионством гауссом I&apos;m puffing, but already at a distance, because in 1988, has been portrayed as the chief of the Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I chose to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsky in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it had to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team to the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the one with the plays in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the US national team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Championships. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and &apos;пикулина&apos; (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) &apos;тоньито&apos; colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &apos;кихоте&apos; Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of knee injuries. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team, which probably was not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 неукене, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role players like &apos;канито&apos; ньевеса, Pablo алисеа and young Rolando хурруитнера instead of players, temporarily estranged for turmoil in панамериканском championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without any doubt, it was a пикулин Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His performance at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has not dominated at this level, as did пикулин. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that is without his career in different leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best пуэрториканцем head? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is a very difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond далмау, армандито Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of the young, I really like the work Leo ариллы. </seg>

<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the guys travel and play too much, and it&apos;s unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruits of compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
