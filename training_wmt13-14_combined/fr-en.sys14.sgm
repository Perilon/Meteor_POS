<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justified their politics by the necessity to struggle against the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And yet the Centre Brennan considers this last to be a myth, maintaining that the electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of persons killed by the lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides, the republican lawyers took a census only of 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A thing is sure: these new dispositions will influence negatively the turnout rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this direction, these measures will mine partly the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of the American governments issued from 2009 news laws making more difficult the process of inscription or of vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon expanded after elections of November, 2010 which turned to be added 675 new republican representatives in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, 180 plans of laws restraining the exercise of voting right in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new Elections Acts demand that the voters introduce an identity card with photo and a proof of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of advance vote, invalidate right to register as voter the poll day and withdraw to the citizens have a judicial case their voting right. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before elections of 2006, no American State demanded voters to introduce an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Indiana was the first State to put down such requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of the Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities hastened to spread this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the course of two last years, they backed bills in 34 States to force the voters to introduce an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, contrary to the Quebec, the American citizens dispose of universal identity card as no card of the health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, 11 % American citizens, that is 21 million persons in age to vote, do not have identity cards with photo issued by a governmental agency of their State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And yet he costs often more than hundred dollars to get the requested identity card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities, and persons with weak income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25 % Afro-Americans, 15 % persons earning less than 35 000 dollars; 18 % citizens of no more than 65 years and 20 % voters from 18 to 29 years old have the identity card requested with photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, voters considered to be voter more for the democratic candidates, are not authorised in several States to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the contrary, these same States allow the members of fishing clubs or of hunt who vote more of the republican side to use to vote for cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no State demanded proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arizona was the first to introduce such requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen of States adopted laws demanding voters to prove that they are citizen&apos;s American. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures aim apparently at limiting Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And yet he appert that two Hispanic voters of three favour the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Moreover, the republican legislators backed in 2011 laws abolishing the inscription of the voters the poll day in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Besides, they limited the right of persons and of groups to give an assistance to the voters wanting to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the general election of 2004, the write-in campaigns of the voters contributed to record about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> And yet measures adopted since 2009 made fall of 17 % the rate of inscription of new voters in 2010 in comparison with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Besides, the republican legislators adopted laws in five other States aiming at reducing the period of advance vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33 % voters who voted in advance was Afro-American, while these last represented the State only 13 % voters of. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same goes for with the Hispanic. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represented only 11 % voters, but 24 % of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In compensation, the whites which formed 76 % voters represented only 46 % voters voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed vigorously to the adoption of laws restraining the inscription of the voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills were blocked by vetoes of the democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate-General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They could limit damage partly. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 on 34 States adopted laws requesting the presentation of an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules set up are going irrefutably to return more difficult the exercise of voting right in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics report the partisan character of the laws for which one voted and they see an obvious objective there to influence results in 2012 in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Centre Brennan of 2011 shows that the States which adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 polls necessary for the electoral secondary school to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> He is too early to maintain with certainty that these legislative modifications at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But a thing is sure: these new dispositions will influence negatively the turnout rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this direction, these measures will mine partly the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening of the cancer of the prostate: to pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the test of APS would sometimes introduce erroneous results, with wrong negative results or else positive forgeries, who draw away useless medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Of what to make hesitate even more the already reticent men to pass of tests of screening. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked for the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies led to the United States, there was a lot of pollution between control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and of credit of firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, that one European, concluded in a difference of mortality between the patients who had a screening and those who did not have it. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also showed, with a monitoring after 12 years, that they have between 30 and 40 % of more chances to have m√©tastases if they are not deflected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend the test therefore from 50 years, or from 40 years if they have a direct parent has already with a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of afro-American origin are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make good decision once a cancer was discerned. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others whom is lazy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is really necessary to make understand to the patient the degree of risk of his cancer, by giving him possible options, by not treating necessarily the cancers of the prostate which do not undermine the long-term life, and by opting rather, in these cases, for an active surveillance of illness. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men to whom a cancer is discerned will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They are going to suggest their making active surveillance and if illness advances, a treatment is going be to given them. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more, they determine that criteria accurately to decide who should or be not treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend therefore nevertheless to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important is to have a debate with the doctor to determine if they should pass him or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the international Society of urology, Movember created a tool which allows to assess for and against of the test of APS. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It is possible to download this document (in English at the moment, a translation will quickly be given) at this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Tell illness </seg>
<seg id="74"> There is not unfortunately miracle recipe to tell the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> In spite of progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best means to reduce risks of suffering from it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> They think that if everybody ate well and moved enough, it would be possible to tell 30 % of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If more nobody smoked, this rate would climb at least 50 %&quot;, underlines Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society of the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the contrary, they assess that about 10 % of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several people remain so completely unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Society of the cancer, the struggle against tobacco addiction remains a priority, in spite of reduction among smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The cigarette is linked to 85 % cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> She also constitutes a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It harms the health of people tremendously. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there is 1,5 million smokers in the Quebec&quot;, deplores the spokesperson Andr√© Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from a cancer falls by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Stoutness and obesity also favour the appearance of illness, according to SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would augment risks of breast cancer, of the colon and of the rectum, of the oesophagus, of the pancreas and of the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity during the whole life protects against the cancer of the colon&quot;, as it is added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Feeding </seg>
<seg id="91"> Organism also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too big quantity, it makes climb risks of having cancer colorectal. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Meat products also, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or salting can draw away the training of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;These last can harm the cells of organism and lead to the development of the cancer&quot;, as it is explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In the course of last years, several scientists studied links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their researches are not however conclusive at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to SCC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them determined a reduction of risks of cancer of the prostate, other one noted an increase rather. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of the vitamin D on the cancer is not apparently established either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance to speak about his concerns and about his family antecedents with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;To pass a test of screening, this does not give the cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The boson of shelled Higgs </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the boson of Higgs created the whole agitation, last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> They indeed think that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the World, only this. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, it is about the last particle existence of which is predicted by the standard Model - our best, or &quot;better&quot; explanation of nature and of behaviour of material - but that was not noticed yet empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, he is not still completely sure that it is well about Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> They know without the shadow of a doubt that an authentic new particle is held, and that it resembles the boson of Higgs predicted by the standard Model a lot. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Besides, new data revealed this week during a big congress of physical appearance, in kyoto, seem to confirm it, but data are still missing to be perfectly sure of it. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Let us assume however that it is well about Higgs, since chances to make a mistake seem slim, and let us see about what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this lower world, an inevitably inevitable law wanting that two things cannot meet in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Not means to infringe this rule - and do not try too extremely, you are going to hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> And even if the physics of particles is the very strange world, it proves to be that she has, also, a law of this type: the principle of exclusion from Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state &quot; consisting roughly of some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the physicists classify particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, good citizens called are found closed, who obey the principle of Pauli wisely. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in other one bosons, anarchists&apos; nasty band fidgets with respect for nothing - anyway, not for this principle, what what means that they can outright be in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This bosons becomes divided then into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, besides) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: m√©sons, whom we will not approach here, and the &quot;particles of force&quot;, by which big force of nature spreads and to which the boson of Higgs would be related in a way. </seg>
<seg id="119"> This bosons - there, it is necessary to underline it here, is not every of animals as exotic as it would be possible to believe it. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read this column, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the &quot;particle of light&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, indeed, a particle having an electrical load moves faster or changes direction, it &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field in this definite place, a bit as a pebble thrown in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Of this &quot;trouble&quot; an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet ray, etc is born.), and this wave is nothing else than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons &quot;bearers of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same goes for the boson of Higgs, in this difference near that it is another field, field of Higgs, that must be &quot;disturbed&quot; so that this boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> And yet this field of Higgs is, much more stable than the electromagnetic field a lot; to thrill it, it is necessary to attain very, very high energies, a bit as though it was about a frozen pond only a very big rock of which could wrinkle the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why it is needed a huge particle accelerator as that of CERN - Broad Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to attain such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful to explain the report between Higgs and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It is indeed all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, as magnets, make it, but others not - a scrap of paper, for example, will never take after itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And similarly, it is not all particles which interact with the field of Higgs: those who make it have a mass, while others (as the photon, hold) do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what &quot;can bring&quot; all these researches, asks Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it serves for proving the validity of the standard Model (MS), and it also allows to the physicists to scan any distance between observations and predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are besides several to wish passionately that it is found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and block some holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This one, it is necessary to say it, is still huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oups!) or material sinks, which forms the World about 80 % materials of (re-oups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But such distances in CERN up to now were not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> The repercussions of these researches in the daily of mister and madam Tout-le-Monde, them, are more difficult to predict, but they would be wrong to presume that there will not be. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Hold: at the very beginning the sixties, the pioneers of the laser, in Laboratories Bell, suspected not at all revolution that their jobs are going to launch. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw scientific applications, but anything besides. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, has already said to us the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who perfected the first uninterrupted laser himself (the first were blown), in 1962 - at first the laser was rather seen as a &quot;gadget of laboratory&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from all instrumentation which encircles research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle perfected a small sensor of light in 1969, in the course of its jobs in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, good that it was in no way its original intention, is of use now as &apos;&quot;eye&quot; for all numerical cameras of the world, and was worth it the Nobel prize for physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> It does not mean of course that the activities of LHC are going necessarily to transform our lives, but it means that, really, they never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way of dying ¬¶ Duty </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee to die in dignity, the Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Debate must resume quickly while a bill gets ready. </seg>
<seg id="149"> And yet in this essential domain, many remains to make. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Duty tried to look there closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, mister L. still lived alone in his flat of Mont√©r√©gie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The cancer of the prostate which gnawed at him had left him a respite of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot; They had given me five years to live, I made seven years&quot;, he says, ambiguous, lengthened in his bed at home by palliative care Victor-Gadbois, by Beloeil, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot; But it is always a shock, it is not possible to be prepared in this&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Illness makes its work: a huge weakness which prevents him from becoming the only one to toilets, and even from eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat down at the table in front of an appetizing to have lunch, he agrees to be allowed to help to eat, relinquished. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Audacious, he succeeds even in smiling, speaks to the unknowns who bustle about around him, bring him its medicaments, give him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot; My biggest wish, it is that I am cured of the diarrhoeia, it is mortifying&quot;, he entrusts. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Some hours later, l &quot;team found a cure in this trouble. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot; In the course of our life, they learn that a man, this pees standing&quot;, tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress at the stage of the child, for some persons, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot; This depends on the capacity of the person&quot; to accept decline, he determines. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of several persons working in palliative care, big instants take place in the heart of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who enter at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a forecast of life maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stadium, l &quot;team of doctors and of nurses who encircles them lavish no more said care&quot; remedial&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die &quot;conscious and stifled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But illness made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot; I have good children&quot;, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot; I have no more wishes in life&quot;, she says, before accepting that a mask is put down it to help her to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She waits however, in next days, for a last visit of her son come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois, the care of the body and the assistant to feeding are lavished, with a group of volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is the palliative care, that is given when there is nothing more of other one to make. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To return more comfortable death. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In the Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants is counted. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is little when they know that all are finished to die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues possible in the best conditions, explains the Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> In the dying, they will agree to lavish care of mouth on the brandy or on Pepsi, according to request. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics will not be required any more to control their rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of the daily. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, a beer to M. X, died in the course of the night was served. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it is his son who will end the beer with the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot; One are helped the fellows as much as the patients&quot;, tells Nathalie Savard, head of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At home Victor-Gadbois, days are in order but are not alike. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Beside an old 93-year-old man who savours his last assembly of family in the court, embedded well in his pillows while they clink glasses in its honour, a 36-year-old young man is tragically dying, encircled with his parents, with his wife and with his two young children, having attracted everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot; For six months, there is always from three to five beds which are occupied by cancerous one of less than 45 years old&quot;, the Dre Christiane Martel gets worried. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53 % patients who are accepted at home Victor-Gadbois 47 % arrive from their domicile, come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> They say that 77 % Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say to care conceived to appease suffering when a sick man reached the final stage of his life, that it is at home, in the hospital or in home of care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisms, as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home from Big Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in care given in the cancerous. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this big deficiency in the healthcare of Quebec that causes fears to several doctors specialised in palliative care of the adoption of a law supervising euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto, signed by leading experts of the palliative care among which the Dr Balfour Mount and the Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to testify their opposition to such initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the Dre Christiane Martel, the system of Quebec of health is not rather competitive to assure that each will have the right to palliative quality care before they agree to undertake euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient passing 14 days to the emergency, in big pain, without their ensuring relieving her. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients ask to die that because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologues keeps going at their patients until last day, in spite of the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already trifling when she left a gruelling chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced in my oncologue that I stopped the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I give up fighting, she told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had said to me that j &quot;props finished! </seg>
<seg id="202"> No all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dre Martel thinks that 90 % sick who ask to die thank the hospital attendants for not having achieved their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it is well necessary to say that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care to the Society of palliative care at home from Big Montreal, the patients would be refractory in treatments against pain in 8 % cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At any end of life, the doctors then have recourse often to the palliative sedation, which returns to put the patient to sleep until the instant of its decease, either in a sporadic way, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is not possible to pretend any more not to hear this part of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more, the not relieved sick man is going to have the possibility of having this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But it necessarily does not mean &quot;I want that you euthanize me&quot;, it means &quot;I want to be relieved&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realisation of this report was made possible thanks to a grant of journalism of Research institutes in health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale property scandals in the Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Civil servants of the rail and waterways network, businessmen of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about a tremendous &quot;system&quot;, blending industry of the building, civil servants, politicians, union activists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; which cost very a lot to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and on 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious as the system crumbles away since they took big means&quot;, Jacques Duchesneau is ironic, deputy in Quebec and ancient police chief of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is by him that scandal is burst in 2011, by means of a thorough inquiry into malpractice linked to the contracts of road jobs in the Quebec, to which the liberal prime minister of epoch, Jean Charest, had agreed only backwards. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and corruption of civil servants. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the inquiry in 2010, he underlines, the only Ministry of Transport would have spared a thousand million dollars on contracts&quot;, some r√©fr√©nant their instincts to touch a quota! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau committee &quot;has already made two mayors fall&quot;, he adds, by hoping that she manages &quot;to show stratagems behind the individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> An unit perms anticorruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> Permanent Unit anticorruption, created in 2011, also gets down to it with its army of controllers, investigating officers and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> More the policemen of &quot;the gang Hammer&quot; who, since 2009, would have led the &quot;trust of sewers&quot; of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> These last weeks, she undertook serial house searches and make accusations for fraud and corruption against local elected representatives, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The fellow on the list would be Giles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his mayor&apos;s post of Laval, third city of the Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having pocketed the repeating slush money in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Engineers to the rail and waterways network of Montreal and businessmen of Italian origin are moreover officially accused, among whom Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> This last made feeling by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of getting of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Itself poured during years 3 % stocks of contracts got in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia which transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of the mayor G√©rald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr Zambito seeded in any winds in 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euro) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then to power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also confessed to have organised a collection of illegal funds for the ex-deputy prime minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Contracts of sewers with which he filled costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked promptly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Giles Surprenant, ex-engineer in public work, detailed well him in front of the committee: in ten years, it received from construction companies presents, invitations to trips, tournaments of golf, restaurants, matches of ice hockey and slush money totaling 736 000 dollars, in exchange for contracts of sewers with which it filled costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other civil servants of the rail and waterways network confessed to have have the palm greased by filling bills from 30 % to 40 %, by extras forgeries. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately closed eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cases with some dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected representatives of Montreal to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the arrondissement of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, east of the island, it rises up from 2010 against the sale of a local bought ground 5 million dollars and sold retail... 1,6 million to promoters, in full property boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70 % of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> Of the inquiry which will be finally set up, it said that she &quot;draws at a thread allowing to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and to pin the culprits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> They are cleaning the wound but would need an unit of clean inquiry Montreal and wakefulness, not to see coming back doubtful practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As they do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes for his/her part that &quot;civil servants stole million dollar hundreds&quot;, but especially gets worried about the role of &apos;&quot;elected up to date on stratagem&quot;, when they did not soak into cronyism! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating at 70 % the part of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in the Quebec, he is ironic: &quot;I was told myself that it was only a pale reflexion of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec offers to limit to 100 dollars donations to parties but it will not change deal, according to him: &quot;As long as the electoral expenses, him there will not be strictly limited aura of the money salts in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> A complete revision of the system of conferment of public contracts and of financing of parties advocates it: &quot;It is not possible to go more low; to go in the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the home on more solid bases, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history tarnishes the international picture of the Quebec and of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own court... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you took a new wingspan with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It is possible to explain it by an individual realisation but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Big players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I advance in their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also a lot brought me. </seg>
<seg id="257"> In the daily, these elements encourage me to hoist my level of game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything goes very quickly to the football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Mais je ne m&apos;enflamme pas. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My beginning in the centre of pretraining of INF CLAIREFONTAINE in my passage in Saint-√âtienne, I always advanced by landings. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You take therefore advantage from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits of this summer are accustomed to compete for matches of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> What makes that a player as I feels like facing and giving the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me as for my positioning a lot. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is backed up by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played the same post as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Is Ancelotti the man of situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect at all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he does not have equal in League 1 and is part of the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a big experience and earned a lot of titles with upper-crust clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He was next to big players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had had a comforting debate with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I went out then of a series of wounds. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence which he puts in me also explains my performances. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What look do you carry on the first seasonal part of PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyons got from us leader&apos;s place. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we stay in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified ourselves for the 8es of finale with way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> They are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything can arrive. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But they will have our word to be said facing very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, to be able to receive return during the 8th of finale. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can PSG become a big short-term European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has of it the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and to register in length. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, PSG finds means so that this plan becomes a reality. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In League 1, not to win title, as last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would represent a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, they are really keen to pocket this champion title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, they are not pasts far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because there were qualities to end first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> A very big season was made. </seg>
<seg id="298"> They ended with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, they are supposed to be champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, accomplished an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think that it is the good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams as Marseilles, Lyons or Claret are in struggle for title, I think that there is weapon to take it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that media waits too much from PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that they wait many us in view of what was invested and with players whom there are. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It is completely accepted. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Afterwards, when 4-0 at home against Troy are earned and that they still find things to reproach for us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> They wonder for what people wait furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="308"> It will be never possible to earn 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> They are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> They try to set up a plan of game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> They proved in Champions League that it was possible to answer gifts. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City which does not succeed, since two seasons, in qualifying itself for the 8es of finale, they also made huge expenses! </seg>
<seg id="314"> With regard to invested sums, you were imagined with 15 points beforehand in truce! </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyons and Marseilles, which was not well last season, was &quot;boosted&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we will be able to have smile by saying to us that, in spite of all difficulties, they ended up taking it. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG seems completely dependent on feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better that they say that there is &quot;Zlatan dependency&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It means that Ibrahimovic is very competitive and it means that he puts a lot of purposes. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This occurred for and he proves that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He showed everywhere where he passed that he was a big player, a worldwide star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, the man and the player are respected. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men whom he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he made is really exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes others to hoist their level of game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows to everybody to advance. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was keen to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from picking up the time of game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I went out of it reinforced. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I succeed in accomplishing good matches in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is for what I hoped since my christening with Overalls. </seg>
<seg id="336"> They drew lessons from what took place in Ukraine and it is necessary today to have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What look do you carry over the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Overalls? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has results as him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are put well in the qualifying group for the world championship. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The selector is strict, close to players, and inspires earns it. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was him. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had reached its target by qualifying us for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will drive Overalls in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The no torn off token (1-1), on October 16th, in Spain does it constitute a founder match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived on the similar match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> All opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and expenses of treatment between stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Besides, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: conviction that the current monetary system, made by banking monopolies, drives to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euro) and a protocol of exchange reassured like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files hand in hand to peer. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions were already recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A small thousand Websites accepts bitcoins as donations or as means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The lesson of the bitcoin, having attained a 30-dollar summit (23 euro) in June, 2011, fell in 2 dollars, five months later, before returning around a dozen dollars today (one takes a census on the site bitcoincharts.com) of courts. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared with worldwide exchanges in real currency or in financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European central Bank (BCE) was interested in it in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency having most success&quot;, &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency as &quot;credits&quot;, used to advance in a video game which they earn by playing or which it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social Facebook network also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But, every time, a central authority controls and treats exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all knots of network are at the same time agents of the book of count, controllers, transmitters of currency, and purchasers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How works this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users is made in reality between two electronic addresses like an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that an user can choose a different address as every payment, assuring anonymity so. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Group of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of encoding with double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Network can so prove the authenticity of transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is as possible to make sure as the exchanged bitcoins well exists in the public book of count, broadcast in all network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Stage-key consists in writing this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes by the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown in computers, and privilege of which winning, goes out of interim central banker, will have to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about a stage of chopping of file, that is to say of transformation of a big file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; new transaction and add him a number before &quot;hacking&quot; group. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Purpose being to find the number which gives a particular footprint (many zeroes at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number was found, other knots prove easily that it is the token. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction thinks then it is indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to cheat, an user wanted to pay twice with the same very quickly money (less than ten minutes), the only one of both transactions would be validated by network - the other rest orphan because two have different footprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer having solved challenge wins 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid the inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 millions, but they are divisible up to the millionth one hundred, what leaves the margin... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of challenge is also raised in every increase of the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of network has already had tops and bottoms. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen stores. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used fault does not concern the protocol itself&quot;, assures Pierre Noizat, who has just thrown Paymium, a firm of payment in true currency using Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> BCE also mentions possibilities of laundering of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Weighty actors as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, as deck of blogs WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Institute Weizmann in Israel, analysed the book of count and showed that about 80 % bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot; huge balances &quot; were thrown. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged&quot;, Jon Holmquist is delighted, who works for Coinabul, who converts golden bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as network of transactions a lot. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in true currency) or in a payment by motive without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are so expensive less. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The bearer manages more his identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement at the traders&apos;, who do not need to instal new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They only has to announce an address which a telephone can &quot;photograph and admit&quot;, specifies Pierre Noizat, who assures credit of the thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of adjournment of the hierarchic systems as more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will be needed of time so that Bitcoin imposes itself, but 2013 could be a turn&quot;, he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> BCE, in the report, plans besides to revalue various risks, today considered as raised, in case of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And afterwards? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army takes again possession of its territory and it is time that the Afghans choose their future, without expecting for everything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is especially the Afghan peasants whom we punished by considering them to be terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the injured men, the mutilating. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, of ancient leaders taken refuge in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as time of the soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadistes, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurgents, these will not be him any more when the Westerners will become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I noticed from the top of hills planted of almond trees thanks to French credits, was made in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of lorries and of armoured vehicles joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no breaking of Taliban on Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances changed since their advance overpowering from 1994 till 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and with blood due to struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had then been received as a kind of liberalisation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve at present. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Ancient mujaheddin, Afghan government and current Taliban meet in the desire to keep the women in a lower position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main notables of antiSoviet war came back to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They were transformed into wheeler-dealers, catching governmental lands to sell retail them in construction sites to the refugees come back from Iran and from Pakistan, benefiting d &quot;huge American contracts of subcontract. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited themselves; most of them besides did not fight themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I heard him in countryside, aspire to a government which is not constituted of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as those will leave who could use American largesse: flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They were next to the modern world during their banishment in Iran or in Pakistan, they appreciated advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65 % populations is less than 25 years old; Kabul counts now 5 million inhabitants, the fifth of the complete population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In cities, the governmental schools are full, of girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will be necessary to give job to these young people who would like to go back any more to the obscurantism of the ancient parties nor to the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opponents, are being very fond of of mobile phones; the television, and its Turkish serials which introduce the modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is present now. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities who are going to order it will be considered as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Ancient commanders of antiSoviet struggle are already concerned to reconstruct provincial militias, which will avoid central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, country of mountains, in strong local identity, should be able to benefit from some decentralisation, just like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised State, to be able presidential strong, abolishing the post of Prime minister which existed since the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The president Karza√Ø does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of elections envisaged in April, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But its country is, since the fifties and already long before, dependent on foreign help. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry was delayed under way, no dam is in a fit state, no system mattering from irrigation is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Priority is left on private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by thirty war years, a governmental control of facilities would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Noise was spread that Afghanistan had huge mining treasures. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It was only adding to the feeling that the Westerners n &quot;were there that to take it over. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat the ore of iron or of copper on the spot, nor of means of transport to export it across mountains, there is mining development. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chineses have already almost left the copper mine of my Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the huge buddhist site and to remain the most important employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> A day also will be well needed that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which depend widely importation and export, restore normal reports. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of the French combat troops ended on November 20th. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new treaty of cooperation envisages the chase of traditional helps: high school of girls, of boys, department of French to the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural domains, support of the archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try &quot;to earn hearts and minds&quot; and to accomplish impossible task to make coincide assistants and offensive actions, a service d &quot;&quot; civilo-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, led, and makes complete NGO successfully by small one French, of many jobs of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens villages of mountain. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These jobs, fond of good food in hand-d &quot;local work, could help to contain insurrection: irrigation, well, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of soil and increase of the cultivable surfaces. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What will we let how remember, after two thousand million euro of military expenditures? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the local, very hard living conditions in these valleys located often in more than 2 000 metres in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy received dozens written requests of small agricultural achievements emanating from local communities of the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> So that they free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, what the farmers told me they wished, it would be necessary to support in the favour a small well controlled, civil help and that touches them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Une Constitution au forceps en Egypte </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new blow of poker of the president Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional statement, which grants him provisionally full powers, he decided to stake everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Catching unprepared all world, he announced, on Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Hardly one week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months in this Assembly to finish his works. </seg>
<seg id="456"> It has been nearly two years since Egypt leans on an interim text, several times amended what weakens institutional stability and driven to legal mess. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative was only augmenting the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the President persists in his &quot;autocratic frenzy&quot;, continuing &quot;betraying his word&quot; and &quot;trampling right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, they assure that it is a means to finish it as quickly as possible with institutional and political crisis, by speeding up the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be organised in fourteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which makes the Brothers abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy while protest rages in all country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems persuaded that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he asserted him in an interview in the weekly American Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> All the more so as this appeal in a rapid vote holds ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers&quot;, these owing suppos√©ment to come to an end after the adoption of Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange ambience that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, in Islamic great majority, voted for the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most Liberals missed in call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Mid-November, a little before the constitutional statement, they had slammed the door, estimating not to have been able to emphasise their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or of society had done the same there. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the necessary quorum is attained, 11 persons, members substitutes, were hastily added, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to Muslim Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Without surprise, it is most often unanimously that one voted for articles. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators besides had a good time due to the fact that one of the only divergences of the day expresses itself around the hour of request, some members of the committee thinking that clock of the constituent was badly regulated. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which still was by train d &quot;to be voted yesterday evening, includes 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of all attention, the article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that &quot;the principles of the sharia are the main source of right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> Parties salafistes, for whom l &quot;establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped they could replace principles &quot; with rules &quot;, what would have allowed a more strict application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the islamists, the fact that this article is not changed is a pledge of their goodwill and of their respect for other elements of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot;, answer the Liberals, who see there only a blow of communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because according to them, the Islamization of Constitution is made through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They notably aim at the article 220, which confers on the university Al-Azhar an advisory role, especially as for proving the compliance of laws with the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because &quot;called people has be pronounced is not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> It is possible to see the premises of a theocracy&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of the Liberals are besides stirred due to the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less softened than the current. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;At present, there is not concrete religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, they stay as part of Registry office. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most jurists who worked on this text are not oul√©mas but academics, for some formed in the French system&quot; temper Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he admits &quot;that there can be an ambiguity around the article 220, because used terms borrow from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> They refer to it in &quot;Fiqh&quot; notably [Islamic case law, editor&apos;s notes]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And question could in future settle to know in which measure of the civil judges is competent to be pronounced over&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticised because of sprawling powers which he grants to the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brothers point out that these are distinctly reduced by comparison with what they were under the ancient regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Other contentious point: powers conferred on the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wish of the servicemen, the examination of the defence budget will not be put before Parliament, but in a national Council of defence. </seg>
<seg id="493"> No more than will be forbidden civilians&apos; trials in military tribunals, as asked for it the associations of human rights protection. </seg>
<seg id="494"> These last also announce their concerns regarding the text, that they judge liberticide. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Offence of blasphemy is supported and insult is prohibited from now on, what could have serious consequences to the freedom of expression, the press notably. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Besides, no article more echos the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, the only positive point is the ban of torture by the article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Word did not appear in the previous Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> While the Egyptian president had to express himself yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are envisaged in the afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> The support of the head of state will march them, on Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="585"> 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists went on Earth Promised from January till October, 2012, that is 51 % more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9th, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="586"> &quot;Who language has, in Moscow goes&quot;: the migrants economise some money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While the deputies and the activists of human rights enter into a debate on what is going to give the law relating to the compulsory linguistic test, impostors selling &quot;wrong&quot; certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million workers migrants come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Mostly, they are nationals of the Central Asia: Ouzb√©kistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> The their only purpose: make money to help their families stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since December 1st, a law came into force and stipulates that every migrating worker will have to take an exam of Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule concerns only those who have the intention of working in the sector of services, of accommodation, services on the individuals and of retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, promises federal migratory Service, tests will become compulsory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Besides, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and of the foundations of right. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It is going to be necessary to validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian to get and to renew its work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The nationals of the countries are exempt only where Russian has the status of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The persons having got certificates or teaching qualifications before the fall of USSR in 1991 are not either concerned by this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of the centres of examination will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of the people, the State university of Moscow, the State university of St. Petersburg and of other establishments of higher education of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The immigrants will be able to take exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres were already opened on all territory. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative in introducing examinations was supported by the deputies of Douma of State and the federal Service of migrations. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have asked question already again and again in the press: what this is going to give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What the obligation to know Russian will change for the Russians and the immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, answer the representatives of migratory service, it will allow to reduce the suffering number of persons &quot;by pro-slavery doctrine to job&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people speak about defence of the rights of the workers migrants, explains the manager of the office of the Russian federal Service of migrations in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Alone a system of organised selection will allow to resolve in 90 % the problems of the foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Problems settle for the unqualified migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, certify Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will give him a &quot;trip&quot; in an overcrowded small house where to it and dozens its similar will fret during months without food and without paper and have to slave away between 12 and 14 o&apos;clock a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints on behalf of our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, a thing is promised them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passport is taken, and they do not receive the envisaged wage&quot;, confirms the leader de la Direction of the services of migration for the job of the migratory service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Do not compete for me, mister policeman! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many nationals of the republics of Central Asia which want to come to make money in Russia entrust that they not only do not know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> It is not really sure their error, but their misfortune: not much of Turkm√®nes, Uzbeks, Tajiks can take the liberty of following it would be only a fairly good primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families even do not have on what to feed their children without speaking to dress them correctly and to equip them for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they arrive at adolescence, these young people leave to make money as soon as occasion comes. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when the language is not known, they entrust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel diminished and minimised&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> The defenders of Human rights point out however an aspect importing the law relating to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Examinations will be only intended for the migrants who have a lawful status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will not be examination or official job later. </seg>
<seg id="622"> However, most workers migrants continue living in Russia in an illegal way. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or defence to enter&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Besides, legalisation costs some money: between 12 and 16 thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, it is possible to get a wrong recording fast for only 1 500 roubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The Russian policemen know that we have wrong documents, that we do not have recording, where from cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us for 100, for 200 roubles, of what to buy cigarettes, tea&quot;, entrusted to the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, national of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot; Make quickly, do not skimp and buy a nice work of art&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the coming into force of the law relating to the language, they discovered that papers of recording of the migrants were not the only ones to be wrong. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several wrong certificates of examinations of languages were already confiscated by the employees of the federal service of migrations. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Counterfeit papers go out of an ordinary colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners had them as nothing: every migrant who so hoped to make easier task of examinations had to disburse seven thousand roubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times as expensive as official procedure: this one will cost to the worker migrating three thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of power and the defenders of Human rights agree to say that short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to buy simply these &quot;scraps of paper &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Authorities can give to the workers migrants who could not validate examination at one stroke the time to do courses of language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Besides, the immigrants who do not know Russian will see themselves offered a job in domains which do not implicate to communicate actively with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Home office does not take care of the market of weapon </seg>
<seg id="640"> The part of crimes implicating lawful weapon is very weak </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior offers to harden law contrary to the bearers of civil weapon. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such is the reaction of authorities facing recent incidents: that it is shooting performed during marriages or during slaughter organised by the jurist of Moscow Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to forbid the harbour of weapon to rubber bullets in public places and to raise the legal age of getting of the licence of harbour of weapon by getting it from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Idea was supported by the leader of the committee of Douma for security and struggle against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that amendments to law on weapon would be introduced in Douma of State shortly. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everybody is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities try to resolve problem by &quot;putting the screws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the net in which his authors, representatives of various centres of shooting, demand to leave &quot; this insane hardening &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes made with a recorded weapon is trifling, declared in Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, jurist and specialist of crime for BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Home office, over a period from six months to 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a gun registered in the services of police while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded on the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that the strengthening of laws concerning the civil weapon will not prevent the criminals from stocking up in the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, it is possible to find today in Moscow any arms for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of the Interior maintains that it controls the broadcasting of the illegal weapon. </seg>
<seg id="652"> The suppliers: of the plant to the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapon buys via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are to the number of five, tells Victor Baranets, colonel in the retirement having of use ten years for the Ministry of Education and for the Headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot drawn of a site taking orders of weapon </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is &quot; the military trace &quot;, that is to say the weapon which was stolen during military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;This weapon was stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians&quot;, explains Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapon coming from the black market those are hidden by the criminals from police force. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is as well about weapon stolen in the supplies of the police as those hidden directly from the representatives of police force. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal guns leave on sale since the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many these last often suffered explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Certified versions point out that some fires were intentionally launched to hide deficit&quot;, explains the ancient serviceman. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, the producers of weapon are for something there. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;They see that plants of private weapon which does not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapon on the black market, notably in Moscow&quot;, tells an expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of other sources of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> An important part of guns and of submachine guns comes from poor countries, as Kirghizia. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;A local, sometimes craft production is found there, a mafia formed and organises supply&quot;, adds the ancient serviceman. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where from comes weapon? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts assessed the rough part of every source of the illegal weapon on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on question was constituted in 2011 by the Centre of analysis of problems and of study for the public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of portals relating to weapon. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The great majority illegal weapon, explain the researchers, comes from the army and from the police force. </seg>
<seg id="673"> The half of the present weapon on the black market was there &quot;by for lack of employees whose job is linked to weapon&quot;, as it is explained in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17 % of weapon come from places of military conflicts, 14 % are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 % come from &quot; underground searches &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A seller and consultant of an armory having asked to keep anonymity assures that since a very long time ago nobody buys weapon found by these specialists of underground search; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Most often, according to him, the sellers are going to search the new goods in the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys through one teach an unit, for example a gun TT. </seg>
<seg id="678"> It is delivered him by passing the goods by a wire netting. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot; He transports it in city and sells retail it for 900 ‚Ç¨ by unit with two loaders&quot;, he tells. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is true that the police knows about all business, so, when crimes are about to be clarified, it performs a purchase of control to the traders of illegal weapon&quot;, adds the seller. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot; As in a boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the purchaser are generally by means of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I consulted sites, blogs, until a type manifests itself and offers me to come to the railway station of Begovaya where somebody became take me in a &quot;corner&quot; to haggle. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, it was given to me on the spot </seg>
<seg id="685"> Victor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, I have to know somebody who has a contact, explains the seller. I know somebody, but I do not trust in him. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers on markets, but there it is necessary to come also by saying for example &quot;On behalf of such person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy even a pair of American fists with the aid of a person in whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> It delivers them to me only to me because he knows that I will not give it. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The new babies search weapon in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The ancient serviceman Victor Baranets had a go as purchaser of illegal weapon in the middle of 1990s when he got ready to publish an article on subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Diagrammes, according to him, did not change. </seg>
<seg id="693"> They gave him an album photo in which there was &quot;all that is wanted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I imagined in a boutique&quot;, remembers the serviceman. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is not secret as the purchaser, explains Baranets, it is possible to try everything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As potential client, I do not content myself with buying, they go with the seller in forest and a target is installed. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;I am let pull and when I am persuaded that the weapon walks well, they begin negotiating&quot;, the expert describes. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A boutique since its chesterfield </seg>
<seg id="699"> Research engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where it is possible to buy weapon &quot;for different manners&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For it, they need no document and anybody to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot; It is enough to have a definite amount of money&quot;, as it is written in advertising on the site &quot;to Buy a gun or a submachine gun of battle&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The users leave their request there and ask their questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And they sell to the miners? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Without licence, of course&quot;, asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (kept orthography). </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;Buy TT. Moscow&quot;, writes &quot;Fedorenkov&quot; in its very direct request. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The federal Service of security broadcast a huge network of wrong sites and picks up by the dozen the persons eager to buy weapon of battle. </seg>
<seg id="707"> People rush on the food as hungry wolves and then they meet to exploit some coal in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> Victor Baranets, observer and ancient serviceman </seg>
<seg id="709"> I heard about this type of diagrammes: generally, the site is recorded out of the field of application of Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The purchaser performs the payment on the automatic demarcations. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;He receives in return a photo and instructions pointing out where is hidden the weapon&quot;, explains the secretary of the association &quot; Droit √† une arme &quot;, Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets maintains that by applying on the site, it is possible to meet without weapon and behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The federal Service of security broadcast a huge network of wrong sites and picks up by the dozen the persons eager to buy weapon of battle. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;People rush on the food as hungry wolves and then they meet to exploit some coal in Siberia&quot;, - he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Makarov for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of an illegal gun, estimate the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the association &quot; Droit √† une arme &quot;, it is possible to buy a gun Makarov for 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It will be necessary to wait about one and a half month. </seg>
<seg id="720"> He went out of warehouses long length by the direction of these warehouses of medium size. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official data of the ministry, in comparison with period January-October, 2011, the number of these crimes diminished on the whole in 7 % Russia and comes to 22,9 thousand while cases proved to be of flight and extortion of weapon, of ammunition, explosive substances and of bombs went down by 7,8 %. </seg>
<seg id="722"> The United States: the employees of fast food restaurants and of supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Near a quarter of the American teenagers passes by a job of cashier to MCDONALD&apos; S </seg>
<seg id="724"> These last days, a wave of protests went up against the low wages practiced by supermarkets Walmart and famous chains of quick restoration such as MCDONALD&apos; S, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos; s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, nobody can predict if this wave is going to expand or gets breathless fast. </seg>
<seg id="726"> This actions are supported by labour unions and some associations of left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> At the same time as the increase of the modest wages which receive the basic wage earners to Walmart and in the chains of quick restoration, the organizers of demonstrations want to get the creation of labour unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is not covered at the moment by union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 hundred a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the &quot;black Friday&quot;, at the time when a breaking rain of balances taking over million inhabitants beat down on America and sometimes launching outbursts. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some wage earners of the society Walmart, which uses in the world 2,2 million persons, left their post to organise stakes of strike with labour unions and activists of left in the shops of the society products of which are intended for the consumers of the modest and medium classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart commercialises everything: layers in shotguns by way of the batteries of car, hoovers, eggs and the milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products are on average 8 % - less expensive 27 % there than in the big supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many wage earners badly paid to Walmart go shopping only on their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Price and choice of products made of Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can take the liberty of selling the cheap products notably because of low wages of his employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> These last also complain about difficult working conditions, for example about the lack of forklifts or about portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the demonstrations of &quot;black Friday&quot; asked for an increase of wage, they complained due to the fact that the price of medical insurance given by the firm had augmented from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the basic wage earner to Walmart who receives 9,5 $ an hour, it is a sum that he cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists of Berkley&apos;s Californian university show that if Walmart augmented the average wage in 12 $ an hour, it would cost to the group 3,2 thousand million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1,1 % of more of what it spends currently. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred all increase of wages on the shoulders of the consumers, every running in the shop would return to them to 46 hundred more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend only 12,39 dollars in year more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The supporters of Walmart point out with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine States and caused no harm to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;black Friday&quot; went on in the shops of 8 h in the evening at midnight the following day and Walmart sold 5000 articles over this period in second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> His cases performed in very 100 million transactions for &quot;black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesperson of the society Dan Fogleman assured in an interview the site of left Huffington Post that in everything &quot;less than five&quot; wage earners of Walmart had left their posts and that protest was only a &quot;operation of com&apos; among so many others&quot; on behalf of the organising labour union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Following client!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York and concerned Walmart shops either (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not established there yet) but MCDONALD&apos; S and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> MCDONALD&apos; S announces to sell thousand millions of portions and afterwards they even do not give you leaves illness and do not pay you the job which you did honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, local member of the Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage envisaged by federal legislation and that of New York is 7,25 $ an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants augment them with time, but of not much, on average his basic employees receive in New York 8,90 $ an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody touches less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> It was one time when almost a quarter of the American teenagers worked at the place of MCDONALD&apos; S after the high school while living at their parents&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw their main source of incomes there or wanted to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I am to interview wage earners of McDonald&apos; s who complain to have to live with this wage and to sometimes have to feed their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal they find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators who threw movement on Thursday at 6 h 30 near MCDONALD&apos; S of the 40th street and on Madison avenue demanded that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast food restaurant are paid at the very least 15 $ an hour, a multiplication of more than two times than the current minimum wage is. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also asked that are created of labour unions in the sector of quick restoration. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law forbids to the administration to stand in the way of it and to punish the protesters of a labour union by bullying or dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration seldom simplifies them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a labour union, to take over quick restoration remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of the personnel. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They do not agree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near some of other chains of quick restoration. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The key instant of protest was gathering in the middle of the day near MCDONALD&apos; S of local Times Small public garden with the intervention of several democratic politics, notably that of Jumaane Williams, local member of the Council, which declared: &quot;MCDONALD&apos; S announces to sell thousand millions of portions and afterwards they even do not give you leaves illness and do not pay you the job which you did honestly!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other democrats of New York within sight, notably by the candidate for mayor&apos;s post Bill De Blasio who declared that &quot;we all must support the wage earners of quick restoration so that they get a fair wage and an economic ease which deserves every New Yorker. </seg>
<seg id="770"> New York Times characterised this demonstration as the most important that the sector of quick restoration in all its history knows. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred persons participated in it without counting that all were not wage earners of fast food restaurant, who use dozens thousand persons in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is at the moment difficult to say if this spark of mass movement will make babies. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, they succeed moderately only in deceiving the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Lately, the fans of new technologies taught to receive the reality augmented through the special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At first, it is Google who has revealed this summer its current model during its annual conference and in November they learnt that Microsoft had applied for the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, he takes out again from maintenance with the manager of the group of technologies of 3D interactive of the laboratory Microsoft of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, where for the scientists of this society, glasses are already of the ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are attracted by perspective to manipulate virtual objects in air at bare hands, by the creation of opened virtual areas. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could you say to us in some words what makes your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We work on correlation between the man and the machine and we try at the same time to enlarge borders of this correlation. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The humanity as a whole stayed for the moment in pixels on flat screen and sometimes in tactile there. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look 5 - 10 years in front of us and to guess the total changes which will occur with this correlation. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the console Xbox and sensors Kinect constitute a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today because everybody is interested in order by gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What also reserves us the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect returns physical correlation, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes there 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information was improved (the system receives more data), but output, at the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change this and we work on systems of imagery really 3D working on different technologies, notably screening technologies. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to get outside the computer world in ours, in the physical world, to make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For it, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space which encircles him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> So, we will be able to supplement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And to begin, let us get rid of these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - Of what do you think of vocal order? </seg>
<seg id="792"> She is appreciated, but isn&apos;t she overrated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> It is not possible to say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality settles because they still do not feel like informing others of its actions or its intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, every type of correlation with the computer is good, but each in its alcove. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order apparatus in public places, we had a plan for which we thought of gestures, no broad gestures, but rather gestures discreet, restrained. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Gestures were not captured by the camera of the apparatus, but by a bracelet carried at the hand which recorded the movements of bones and of muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> He is currently big, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by mixed order, for example: gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - That is? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you ask me to pass you this young duck? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would make it with word and with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually, I speak only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, this is going to be difficult to admit. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Therefore, you want to force the users to fit according to what the machine can or not make at some point? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not inevitably, but it is about a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the immediate future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors which will allow us to identify better the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It can be for example about laser sensors, they produce a rather good resolution in depth and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If they are interested in your job on sensors Xbox Kinect, what you do not like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack resolution, depth or else anything else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based in our job on recognition 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> He would be of course well to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But problem is not megapixels themselves, but quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In comparison with this last point, all current technologies are rather good, it tops up job in the concepteurs of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is necessary to keep resolution in mind according to axles X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed matters also a lot, the number of frames in second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are rather dynamic, and 30 c/s are not enough really, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory of Redmond gave to the touch of sensors a regular delay of treatment included between 1 and 100 ¬µs, the current sensors being more near the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everybody does not understand to what extent it influences the correlation of the man and of the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would well need an apparatus of this type in my job, but not requiring touch, to have more frames in second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But should not you augment the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect has today three &quot;cameras&quot;, among which the one is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the thoughtful signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is in fact a habitual sensor of the visible field. </seg>
<seg id="823"> She does not serve for defining the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could resolve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Where to get worse him by augmenting the volume requested by calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras and to see how it could help to define sites. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As much as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not introduce its glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do not you think that from a point of view of the daily use of technologies of augmented reality, glasses are one of the platforms introducing most perspectives? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, to go for a walk at all times with a smartphone the raised hands is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality which would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Glasses are a very personal apparatus and this makes their force (the personal elements are those what you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality augmented from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other persons. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let us imagine one instant that the manipulation of objects virtual holographiques in air is not accessible more than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple lethal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem on which the opponents to this idea check the finger off: there is not tactile feeling! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers does your group prepare in comparison with this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lessons, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in correlation between the man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile feelings. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to act as support of picture. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She records pressures perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies which are indeed intended to allocate palpability in these &quot;pictures in air&quot;: for example the interference of several rays ultrasounds run to a definite point where is the finger and which gives you feeling, for the moment even weak, of a breath of air on fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets carried on the wrists which have an influence on the nervous endings of fingers, they are also a working axle introducing perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make believe to him that he feels what he should normally feel at the time when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - Here is a good idea, we have not tried yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is another task under here on which it will be even necessary to devote itself for a long time of the trouble: the way to make believe to somebody who is physically in a very reduced space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - to us let us work on concepts of treadmills (nothing to see with those that they find in the clubs of fitness), mobile platforms and also huge bowls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, they succeed moderately only in deceiving the brain, there still remain many working years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Here is what returns job on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; follows plan &quot;p√©tersbourgeoise vanguard&quot; devoted to the townspeople who are ahead of time, in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This ultra-selective list has already welcomed distinguished actors of the artistic stage of St. Petersburg achievements of which go beyond the border of the city and which found a recognition in Europe, having been known in all Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the extraverti Kirill Miller painter. </seg>
<seg id="851"> All city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, everything of dressed red that it is possible to cross near the Russian Museum, near the Summer garden or else in holidays and trendy private views. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The pictures of Kirill Miller always gather crowds, whatever is their place of exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="853"> He is one of the p√©tersbourgeois storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the p√©tersbourgeoise vanguard of the end of 1980s and of the beginning of 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants laugh and puts them in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> It has recently taken in the hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role all over its existence, its philosophy and its tramp&apos;s picture. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why do you go through the city everything in red and not in yellow or in turquoise for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red as couturier specialised in the aspect and the picture. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of picture and the society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in the society, all that is not grey provoke aggressiveness and negative agitation. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to start debate. </seg>
<seg id="862"> All history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you understand that you had to be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In the exhibition of the Palace of culture Nevskiy where were my jobs. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that it was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of the old not official painters had passed and the new, free, in my type, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I began striking up a friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then there was no more space. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in theatre, in fashion, in music, in all types except in words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this was in your artistic Private hospital - It was important for me to find me in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg where has to meet the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took set up to Pouchkinskaya-10 who sheltered before jobs a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the p√©tersbourgeoise bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many people were born there: NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with plan &quot;The ear of Van Gogh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in close-fitting vests, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, compositor today in fashion. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began occurring there live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg presented quite a lot of programmes before the epoch of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg and it is while his big career began, but his training and his basic education, it is at our place that he received them. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gal√©rie &quot; D137 &quot;, Club &quot; Gribo√Øedov &quot;: these are repercussions of the artistic Private hospital. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees left as repeat customers there. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of passed century, of epoch when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, an opinion poll was organised in the press: it was price &quot;The personalities of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was named &quot;Painter of the year&quot;, and it is while my reign came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in new epoch with ancient rules, I am a representative of truth, of honesty and of culture of the passed century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it is possible to be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your jobs are characterised by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many my pictures are hits, they have an actuality and a very strong acuteness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to have a programmed exhibition &quot;The Russian museum across the buffoons&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The buffoons belong to a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was somebody social hurt frightened, today and to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the buffoons, everything fades, tragic falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I like the ridiculous, I have ridiculous ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the complete and compulsory fancy dress. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the morning coat which matters, they are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person. </seg>

<seg id="895"> Who else that I can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But perhaps that commercial art can also be nice? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur-like. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of culture is occurring. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were shared in herds, the supporters of the bohemia liked a thing, the simpletons other one. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, it is necessary to think whom you are going to please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Every star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But several thousand persons come to see Stas Mikha√Ølov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - It is persons whom they threw who come to see him, it is the sexual and social side which walks. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 persons will come, 10 thousand will not come and in the last analysis it is less management, money, everything droops. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the principal it is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I combed pictures that a collector stuck next to Falk or to Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I began with the pictures which usually are those who are painted at the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, ideas are often merged. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: there is spiritual culture, culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption does not have culture, this has got nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of yesterday culture, I grew with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what misses in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the civil servant of culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But all cannot work in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not just like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are good consultants today. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be expert, but they are moved aside, because one needs higher experts who will assess these experts correctly and clear them a way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot; that flourishes. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Same Erarta, but they postpone in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to be of other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is it St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is in Moscow much more culture, there is a soil as it. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art finds it difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there is curious a lot who are going to see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> At our place, this layer is very fine. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must return art in fashion as it was case at the beginning of last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Plan accomplished with the support of the grant of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Climatic warming or collision with a bloody asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with landowning aboard go looking for a planet of help. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save the humanity, a big question settles: how to continue making live our kind in weightlessness or else on a planet of help? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that he not there not a lot the choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two true planets which it is possible to win, it would be only by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot; It is about Venus and about march&quot;, estimates Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the astronomic State institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If on march conditions are more adapted for life, the temperature in the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> It is possible to live only at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus in the space there. </seg>
<seg id="942"> They began being interested in the questions of reproduction in the space focused on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is another half a century, experiments on plants were performed. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of cultivated green peas on orbit were no way different from landowning varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, they put on orbit of insects, small flies reproductrices fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, eggs of quail were sent in the space to see how an embryo in weightlessness developed. </seg>
<seg id="947"> A completely normal chick is got at the exit. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot; Problem is linked to the fact that the chick must find a support, he must put on on his legs and begin moving&quot;, explains the manager of the laboratory of the Institute of the m√©dico-biological problems of the Academy of sciences of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By finding no support, the chicks fidgeted untidily. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And at the end of 10 hours, new born saw their instincts entirely atrophying. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks reacted neither to light nor to sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they would die simply at the end of quattre days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot; We opened eyes wide to them twice, then we left, because it is simply impossible to work with them there&quot;, explains Vladimir Sychev by determining the failure of experience with the chicks in the space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;biological miniature ark&quot; with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Experiments will continue in spring on 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite &quot; Bion &quot; will load only kinds of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experience with rats sent with their foetus in the space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot; It was still about biosatellites and then it is the only experience. It is necessary to perform this research type&quot;, points out Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the rats of the space gave birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, they still do not manage to perform reproductions directly in the space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is not a slim affair. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their habitual middle, the animals are not any more capable of accomplishing their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Contrary to the animals, the man is capable of it, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homosexual sapiens has abstract thought, he is capable of creating a proper emotional bottom. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not accomplished for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women go to the space for already 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Most assigned risk was taken by Terechkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And female organism is what the humanity has of more precious. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our sea gull flew off and nobody on Earth could say if he would hold after a flight in the space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she would have been able to give birth to a child after flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot; Nobody answered this question&quot;, explains Vakhtang Vatchnadz√©, pensioner of the sector of rockets and of the space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June, 1964, just one year after his flight in the space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a small girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikola√Øev was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and even worked in middle extra - v√©hiculaire, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, risk continues. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have not much, even very few cosmonauts who had nothing and who give birth to a derivation in full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot; And if they are longer, it introduces a danger during flights on orbit&quot;, concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, the humanity must search new solutions in biotechnologies, protection against radiations and creation of an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre of preparation of the cosmonauts: compulsory stage of preparation in flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in no buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for exits extra - v√©hiculaires. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water imitates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for the adults, the water is comfortable but however a foreign middle, for the new-born babies, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> As much as the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of the belly of his mother, it is easier to him to get used then to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is logical in principle, because since the birth up to the first bath, there happen only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot; It is little to forget&quot;, explains the instructor of swimming for new-born babies, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weighty force. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, of the basin atrophy very fast, the capacity of increase of the baby gets lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Token agreed, by pressing are unaware this we on the simulators of delivery. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is possible to prepare a delivery of course in a special room, the woman will succeed in getting outside it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot; And then?&quot; Valeriy Poliakov asks to invite to think on this complex question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the Earth&apos;s attraction, organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> It is not possible to dress a new-born baby as an adult with a special combination for trainings. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He will be simply deprived of his vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot; And this experience which we would envisage in that case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will succeed on the way back on Earth of a handicapped, entirely unadapted child&quot;, envisages the Manager of the committee for the bioethics of the Institute of the m√©dico-biological problems of the Academy of sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of the children in the space still raises theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time it will bring into being, when the Landowning will go in their shuttles towards a distant planet which will become the habitat of their derivation born in the space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The leader of the ISC (the upper Institution of control of public finances) declared: &quot;the control of the independent pseudo job (in Czech&quot; system ≈† varc&quot;) failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public works contracts, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation but it lags behind as for its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> It is what declared Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the upper Institution of control of public finances in an interview for Aktu√°ln ƒõ. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;Law will be never perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking at our place&quot;, declared Kala in the comment of current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control led jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He names as example of excessive practice approaches of the &quot;system ≈† varc&quot; by Petr Neƒças. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Mister prime minister has recently declared that l&apos; ODS is not going to importune the businessmen with controls; is it therefore allowed or does forbid? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot; Law must well be applied in either way, then if she forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent from acting an authority made responsible for going to survey to demand the respect for law&quot;, determines Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> During the meeting of the board of enquiry in the Chamber of Deputies, you recalled a tch√©co-German plan as part of which was compared legislation in public works contracts of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> Of what was it a matter in concrete terms? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is about a parallel control which we threw there is it about two years. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, European legislation envisages to manage how public works contracts and particular national legislation as well as practice as such follow it. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We gathered all that and although this procedure of control is not finished yet, very interesting difference appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps &quot;more strict and of better quality&quot;, nevertheless, according to some parametres, practice as such is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms therefore that it does not only have to work more and more detailed rules out persistently but that it is necessary to dedicate himself to the applying even of right. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> In what can this plan help you in concrete terms and as a result for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should just contribute to the fact that we give up trying hard to specify laws, to go down and to improve thresholds, when it has no effect really positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means to get the matter in hand in a reasonable price (what still does not mean the lowest), to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of markets, this target will not be willy-nilly reached. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It would be possible that this system is in such point immersed by the documents, that those who search faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had stayed higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak of concerning internal problems the putting into practice of the legislation of public works contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How works the system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our different ISC or a fashion of organisation? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for institutions, similarly in ISC, Bundesrechnungshof works there who is organised similairement, it also has an advice constituted a bit differently, but these two institutions go about things fundamentally in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however in comparison with our system: Germany being a federal structure, it has then national audit offices of this type at the level of the different L√§nder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can only control the federal money, what corresponds at our place to the resources of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds managed at our place by regions and municipalities, are controlled at the level of the national audit offices of L√§nder there. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards national legislation, is she simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would not like to make general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in some domains, Germany is often indicated as a model but it is not surely possible to say that it makes better in every field. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is is possible be owed to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data of comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is necessary to say also that this country which we consider to be a model is also confronted with the whole series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would not have any advantage to collaborate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards national legislation, that meant for you, as institution, the amendment of law on public works contracts, its effects are already felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment having come into force relatively recently, it still does not have impact on our operations of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we make a posteriori controls, it is necessary to count with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we threw a new instrument of &quot;detection of risks of mismanagement&quot; with which we passed to the riddle about 14 000 public works contracts - there these changes will be felt of course, because thresholds were changed as well as conditions of some types of procedures of invitations to tender and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Therefore do you consider the adoption of this law rather to be an advantage or an increase of load for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law constitutes a step in good direction and I hope that the future will confirm it. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem which can happen is that these rules become more strict and that it is not possible to respect them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the contractor (for example the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled subjects controlled to accept that any violation of law on markets means a breach of the financial discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it therefore useful really to return more strict law in that way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not in that way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or to abuse it but not to punish those who make definite errors without consequence to decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such system is going to put advantage of pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> What is therefore solution to take out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us look towards where we do not go. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister declared that ODS is not going to importune the businessmen with controls of the so-called system ≈† varc - means what it? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the system ≈† varc prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> Law must well be applied in either way, then if she forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent from acting an authority made responsible for going to survey and from demand the respect for law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can declare: &quot;We are going to change law and allow it&quot;, but he cannot say that we are going to act as nothing happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on markets includes relatively strict rules on formalities to be fulfilled and it, just to protect the invitation to tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is moreover tragic that a bidder is only eliminated because of definite defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Law will be never perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking at our place. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads are by places frozen, but most remain workable. </seg>

<seg id="1116"> Who had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> At first I think that it was my idea, then we conceived everything with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Except the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we want so together, with the public, to think about the world state which we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, notably shoes, T-shirts, bags, and of original keys against the end of the world, by buying online them on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world which is called &quot;the cancelled End of the world&quot; (in Czech &quot;Konec svƒõta zru ≈° eno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> She is already very popular on YouTube, she will be also heard during these charitable concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, everything at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung at the same time by all interpreters in three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Hymns will meet so at some point as part of completely unique, direct programme, of Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words of this song were written by Tom√° ≈° Han√°k who also plays the title role of Jesus in the pop video, Xindl X also sings to it... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come from it to collaborate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We collaborate with other personalities of Czech showbiz, because of fact than we organise many concerts and charitable events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try hard to make them participate intensively in these plans. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It proved to be that most of them are interested by such cooperation and that this entertains them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> For what will be of use the benefits of these concerts against the purpose of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to the persons with reduced mobility and of that we work on realisation as part of the institute Jedliƒçka, with the association Tap, and this for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers go regularly to the pupils of the institute Jedliƒçk≈Øv and offer them activities which interest them and entertain them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students have no means themselves to go to courts, we try to help them in that way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the building of the institute Jedliƒçka, we will transfer this plan in a new independent building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and interpreters will go up on stage during each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria, have you the choosing? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to work out a programme which contacts all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will take up on stage Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji  √≠ Such √Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Also get ready for others &quot;mega events&quot; of this type in future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time as part of the spring of Prague; there also, we will prepare surely a quality programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play the United States next year in the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the spot, I would really like to combine concerts in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international plans are minimalist, until now you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of handicapped persons. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organisation and the logistics of your tours? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so terrible as this has air at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in electrical chair devices of which have to travel in hold, naturally we also lug around many luggage and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Until now everything took place well more or less always, ƒåSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where from we have come back recently, everything took place without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your travels abroad, you can compare in what these countries differ as for the opportunities of access for the persons with reduced mobility, for the attitude of public opinion in relation to the persons handicapped and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiments up to now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at our place, we have just been witnesses in Moscow where in the East all is still only in an initial stage. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In comparison with Prague, Moscow is still little accessible to the handicapped persons; there, it is not although common that a person moves only in electrical chair in the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They still do not consider to be an obviousness to give priority to a person in chair in a lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there also, an association trying hard to draw attention to the problems of the handicapped persons is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what must we again catch the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things for which we are still late... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that improvements and refinement always depend on efforts displayed by the persons concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is completely common that people with a heavy disability move only in the public areas; they can go to toilets, to museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not nevertheless very frequent there that a big number of handicapped persons takes an active part in the social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary in the top of progress! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect for the public and opportunities of access are a thing, but situation will really begin changing when we will have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, it is only cases isolated from persons who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let&apos;s go back some years, what pushed you in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I began working as teacher on the institute Jedliƒçka, where I thought I was encircled with many young people ready to put himself into something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am musician myself (I play the saxophone, between others,), with a colleague, we created an activity music. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with time, as says our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, the control of situation (laughs) was a bit lost. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Success arrived only in the course of these last years, if I do not make a mistake? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> That&apos;s true, fact to create links with known singers and to work actively on the promotion of the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as though it did not exist in the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, on top of that, allow us to have quality professors, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Had you as objective to attain such level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I had a feeling that there was a potential to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Show business is full of knack which copies. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a sense, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with caution and this lasts for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Rare are original plans, and I dare to maintain that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But pity is completely useless, because people with a disability are not suffering, abandoned beings of all, because we must take in pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> It is people who can live a full life and bloom, on the condition of having of it necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with a disability succeed in accomplishing something, it is not only an advance for them but for all society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Isn&apos;t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality job, we must be uncompromising in a lot of domains and demand some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some persons arrive at our place with a romantic vision and the head in clouds and, when they realise that they have to come to repetitions twice a week, do preparative course and spend a lot of time on roads for concerts, they lose their enthusiasm fast. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this works in the same way in every group which wants to work and to reach targets. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The The Tap Tap group counts currently twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How much d &apos;between them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The only one, L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an opened group, people enter and leave, they can nothing there. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always opened to those who want or would feel like joining us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> This will be case the day before day envisaged of the purpose of the world, on Thursday, December 20th, 2012 from 21 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, in Brno in Fl√©da and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the cooperation of twelve groups and of other musicians of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of party, these three cities will be linked by broadcasting relay when will be jointly sung the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;the cancelled End of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The purpose of the concert is to gather medium financiers (at the level of 25 millions CZK) to equip the centre of multifunctional training Studeo which is in Prague in the institute Jedliƒçka. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket in this concert is from 400 CZK, the entrance is free for the children until 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is opened to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and universe. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, during the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member state of the ancient Eastern block (the Czech Republic became full member on November 12th, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the course of the years which followed participated in a number of plans of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road of Poland towards the space however started much more early. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like to recall conference for example of A. ≈† ternfeld in the astronomic observatory of Warsaw, on December 6th, 1933, in the course of which he introduced ideas drawn of his progressive called work &quot;Introduction to astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and of years later ≈† ternfeld remembered that alone the doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, ≈† ternfeld got price in France Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for the work &quot;Introduction to astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Aforementioned doctor Jan Gadomski (on 1899 - 1966) became later a big proponent of astronomy and of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many works dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a proponent of world-famous astronautics, the contribution was notably rewarded due to the fact that the name was given to one of the craters of the face hidden from the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> From 1925 was constructed in Poland a track inspection car intended to be equipped with an engine rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Neither the author nor the details of this plan are unfortunately known. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> He is not clear either if the rocket had to serve for projecting or for slowing down the track inspection car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known on this track inspection car is those of the press of epoch. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933, the Polish artillery began dedicating itself to rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Researches were performed by the institute Kom√≥rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It emerges from kept documents that this research had attained the stadium of trials. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, researches stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the plans of a rocket of photoelectric hunt, drawn by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski, appeared in the specialised press and next year was published work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two plans had as purpose a military usage of the engines of rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before war, all plans of use of the technology of rockets were led by the interim advisory scientific committee (&quot; Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy &quot;), which co-ordinated all jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of functioning, the beginning of war put an end to its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other jobs dedicated to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the society Polish astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a matter of a society in the number of November, 1954 of the newspaper Problem, in which are four more detailed articles dedicated to aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by the professor Mr Subotowicze, it is offered to create a society dedicated to astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, plans of artificial satellites had been already thrown and it was clear that the domain of space research had future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year on 1956, the society Polish astronautics (PTA) made efforts to enter international astronautics in the federation (created in 1951) and from autumn, PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> Next year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (on 1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the federation international astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He kept his function up to his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, PTA brought a significant contribution in the development crowned with success of the meteorological rocket RM (RAKIETA METEOROLOGICZNA), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific researches. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was ended in 1957 and the first launching took place on October 10th, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket of a 1800-metre range had a 80 cm length and weighed 5 a little less than kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later was constructed an improved version, RM-1A and, during summer, 1959, trials of flight of the two-storeyed rocket RM-2 was started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a 1,4-metre length and weighed probably 11,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Following archetype should have been capable of doing concrete scientific works - the rocket RM-34 should have had a range going up to 14,5 km and to serve for noticing the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all jobs of development were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The rocket Meteor-1 perfected in the course of period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, conceived with two floors, had a complete length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A,-1B and-1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for the scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had a space giving a 0,4-litre volume, while in Meteor-1B this volume litre and in 0,62-litre Meteor-1C was 0,34. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of device was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> For the period 1965 - On 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were perfected in the aicraft institute, the first trials of flight started in October, 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of transporting a payload from 10 kg to an altitude about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later were constructed Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is still necessary to mention the entrance of Poland in COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> As part of the programme Interkosmos, Poland also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim√≠r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abolition of law on jobs of public utility is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional court abrogated law on jobs of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision gave rise in public opinion to a deep debate. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is unquestionably interesting to examine these problems of a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems orientated to liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are founded on the principle of more regulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are forever in conflict some with others. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This results from the principle of the freedom of trade and of the (unlimited) circulation free from the deprived capital alloyed with an unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Considerable difference of the price of job (wages) generates a tension on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is necessary to put following signification under this term: a producer tries hard by the importation of property sold down with taking to resist economic competition by &quot;by returned more a lot &quot; the price of the rival, with the intention of taking away a bigger part of the market and augmenting so his own benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale, this means for most the businessmen: either transfer production abroad, or buy cheap, or disappear. Result is an unemployment mattering in the countries where the prices of job are raised in comparison with other savings. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no responsibility of social point of view and thereabouts even of responsibility in relation to the unemployment which it procreates, the welfare costs of the State augment necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of misters businessmen to pay taxes and to compensate so for the economic and social damage caused in the whole society by this running in benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is in such point generally known as it is not necessary to give concrete statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Practices without scruples of the private capital procreate in the different savings a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to launch into a mutual competition to lower artificially the social level of their own population with the intention of attracting at home the foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of the capital deprived without taking into account social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This manifests itself mainly in the amendments of laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Objective is to force economically its own population to accept the diktat of the prices of the private capital, notably in the field of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This occurs on one hand by a system of economic pressures in case of long-term unemployment and in other part by the restriction of the rights of the wage earners in the field of the legislation of job. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> He results from it an increasing poverty and the deepening of difference between the rich men and the poor people. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In RFA, there are many years points of public distribution of food for the poor people who cannot meet in them needs with their own job. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these persons is already counted by millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the increase of the competitiveness of German economy, he becomes completely common that the wage earners receive such wages as the State is forced to pay a supplement so that they attain vital minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such scandal was updated for example in the case of the wage earners working as assistant helpers on the federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The measures of economy of practically all Member states of the south of the EU generate, unquestionably, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the society, people are compelled or to emigrate (as it was case in the XIXth century), or to struggle along with wages of misery, outside the society, in the hope that one day the private capital invests in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is here necessary to ask following question: where from will come this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If he comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty will pass from a country to another; this capital can not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue working for a fraction of an European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also concerns all Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and media maintain, to grow tired of it, that the State cannot make investments in capitals in its own economy, that the controlled economy drives to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital defends idea fiercely that the State cannot intervene in economy by regulating interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It is then necessary to wonder if the private capital does not influence and, even, does not run politics today, according to its own selfish interests, and by the same, the State entirely. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is unquestionably yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Proof is there that there is a practically all-powerful and present lobby in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> It results from it a hopeless situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by the conferment of mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not actionable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In RFA, situation is such, as because of lack of medium financiers, the national ministries delegate the development of the plans of laws to law firms closely linked to industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted to the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The all the power does not come from the people, as declare him the constitutions of Western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies orientated to liberalism see themselves now fast confronted with the situation described by Appianos in the called work &quot;crisis of l&apos; Roman empire at the time of Caesar and of Pumping&quot;: &quot;L&apos; State was for a long time in rapid decline and functions were allocated by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of slush money, favours got illegally, and stones and swords were also used to get these posts. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Slush money and corruption proliferated unlimited and the people went to elections with already sold voices &quot;... &quot; Honest people tried not at all to get functions, as a result the State stayed 8 months without consuls&quot;.... &apos;They really began saying that the cure in this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man&quot;... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pumped, but it is Caesar who transformed democracy irr√©versiblement into regime absolutist. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antique, the current society is founded on the preference of personal benefit, without respect for the interest of the society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In its petrol, the private capital is not capable any more of including and of emphasising the interests of the society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> He results from it, today as in the past, a decline without preceding of elites, without any effort to perform reforms in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must therefore search reasons of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalisation without scruples of the economic systems of the XIXth and XXth centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the present state of affairs, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems to the advantage of the democracies of liberal type as a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundred of thousand future losses in human lives, humanitarian and social crises the witnesses as well as the crimes against humanity of which we are such today as us know them all over the ancient history and recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abolition of law on jobs of public utility is not a solution, of the least long-term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both on international plan and in European internal level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue searching means to diminish the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This tendency is indeed systematic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Solution consists of reforms with sociopolitical aims, which will reinforce investments in capitals of the State in economy, augment the influence of the citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of the capital deprived in the society to the advantage of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will ever go out of violence and ever be able&quot; Sting in the Fragile called song declares the main poetry of refrain of which is &quot;let us not forget how much we are fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot; If my sons did not want wars, there would not be&quot;, asserted Gutele Schnaper, the woman of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Further to the last wave of acts of violence between Israel and the band of Gaza, as usual, many reactions rose. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some people side of Israel, deducing from its right to self-defence and putting the Palestinians in terrorists&apos; role, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide made against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel to be a terrorist State. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to think on the question of knowledge which is guilty and that is victim, in its waves of recurrent slaughters; as a result, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not live the beginning of acts of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to give to the readers a located point of view &quot;behind the curtain&quot;, on that who benefits from mainly tensions which continue already for more than 95 years (as from statement Balfour in 1917) in a small end of country of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of this reflexion lean on available historical facts in study, others come out again from my own understanding of that, or more exactly from the subgroup of a species, which is the main instigator of events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The humanity history is first of all the history of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Every epoch, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so obvious is to know if these individualities acted in an independent way or if they owed their acts to the throne to somebody who ran their acts according to objectives beforehand defined. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must suppose that we live in an epoch when worldwide wealth is concentrated in the hands of some individuals and whom this financial concentration procreating some powers could not make in the course of the single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families having an astronomic wealth the Rothschild family distinguishes itself particularly, which could be considered to be the head of the octopus (I am unaware if these families have another leader but I do not exclude him). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Few is written on their subject. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> From the nineties of the XIXth century, they acquired the first worldwide news agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts with which they were blended and that had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their destiny or two. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major participations in almost most central banks of the world and prepare or lead wars against countries in which they still do not have such participations (before the plague of Afghanistan the number of these countries supports 7, after the plague of Iraq of 5, after the inversion of Kadhafi only with 4, meantime Russia put the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Every person who tried to stand against this family died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew in Bank of America des Rothschild the status of central bank and started to issue during civil war his own money (governmental, I really hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began issuing some clean money and wanted to dissolve EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue against EDF to have launched the big economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power at worldwide level drove in 1859s in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war had as objective to eliminate the big state monarchies of Europe, the second had to abolish colonialism, notably British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0,5 thousand million individuals (such slaves&apos; quantity is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create the single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing else than the detonator of such solution) and, in the final, to acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families with at the head Rothschild consists in creating a crisis then in offering a solution then (order ab chaos - l&apos; order according to chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always drive to a worsening of situation (to see creation of EDF destiny to avoid that are not repeated crises as those that they caused in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having succeeded in launching the first world war by assassination to Sarajevo de Ferdinand, heir Habsbourg in the austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed tsarist Russia by causing bolchevique revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended shortly by a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (war was not necessary any more for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the dividing up of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier launching of World War II, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they imposed, on one hand, in Germany of colossal war repairs generating so the conditions of a stepping up of impoverished masses (they only has then to put an energetic enough leader, pointing at culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which had to play the role (that she really held) of the Fifth Column to bring things to a head and to launch a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the XIXth century, Rothschield inspired the creation of Zionist movement, return of which one of the branches inhaled in the creation of a Jewish, preferred State in the region of the historical Judaea with Jerusalem as capital (to Sion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The statement of Balfour mentioned above laid the foundations for Jews&apos; massive emigration towards Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were made on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> World War II burst; it is difficult to appreciate if Hitler cast off chains in which the international bankers had held him initially; or if all that he made was planned, fact is however that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the worldwide community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as war repairs imposed in Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel lighted a home of fire that can cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers manage to launch this war, the Jewish population will be as it was it in the course of World War II, first victim of battles, this time as well as Arab or generally Muslim population of the Medium East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is as a huge laboratory, the source of dissension and of chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it is enough to see how people become divided fiercely between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is victim in Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a fault procreates another fault according to a circle of endless violence and where they find, at the origin of everything, the cupidity of some individuals and their desire to acquire power on the whole world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is here necessary to tell difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as at our place, the international bankers offer to people on elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel is an example typical of loyal, fascistic politician in relation to the international bankers, who makes everything to launch a war with Iran, who could, because of the membership of this country to the organisation of cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc) to stretch to become a worldwide conflict and, given that Iran controls the d√©troit of Ormuz by whom pass in transit 20 % of all worldwide oil (this naval corridor has a breadth only of 2 miles) and procreate a destruction of worldwide economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under which light appear now purposes held by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing which we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new worldwide order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their idea, new worldwide order is the world of masters and of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The world in which aristocrats&apos; handle of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> The world in which very new born sees itself establishing in birth a microchip making of him a completely controlled being. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot; That they compel all individuals, babies and big, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or the forehead a mark to the red iron, so that he could neither buy nor sell the one who has no name of this ferocious animal or the figure of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to include: that the one who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number indicates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Film de Le Argo : lorsque pr√©sentent le va au plus mal, appeler Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November, 1979, a composite crowd of demonstrators of Islamic students took attack the American embassy of Teheran and kept 52 diplomats in hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They must be liberated in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after revolution, had run away in the United States, who supported his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> Situation did not give to the American administration of positive exit, she could not, indeed, leave the Shah, because it would have gravely shaken the confidence of his allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where revolution had resulted in the establishment of a th√©ocratique regime, she was capable of getting the liberalisation of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, blow still aggravated later by the failure of the try of liberalisation of the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The sequestrated diplomats were finally liberated 444 days later, further to negotiations organised by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate provoked in the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Iranian breaking up contributed strongly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter facing Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, of the actor and movie director Well Affleck, describes an episode of this history which gave a small victory in America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before she is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated events, they met in the residence of the ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, CIA managed to get outside them from Iran thanks to an improbable cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of filming come to make locations for the filming of a film with big show of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of types </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Le planifient de l&apos;expert demi-cadratin l&apos;exfiltration Tony Mendez a requitt√© la collaboration la d&apos;Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To return the more credible legend, of go shopping specialised mentioned this plan of film, conferences of presses were organised and a society of fictitious production had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of operation have remained for a long time secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film of Affleck is an unusual combination of several types. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is on one hand about a political thriller conceived in a realistic way but also one &quot; caper movie &quot;, the story of a successful blow, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&apos; s eleven, the twelve and the thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Ambiences succeed one another: sequences of Teheran of documentary style (in captioned sequences are introduced of the iconic photographs of the epoch of events and the way, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retranscribed in the film, there is not big difference), </seg>
<seg id="1355"> lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little of exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> and then stages of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with fancy-dress men discussing situation around tables of conference, in corridors and on the telephone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Well Affleck succeeded in starting again its career in a remarkable way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Of derided actor, he became a respectable movie director and his actor&apos;s game ceased provoking ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is the third feature-length film after the absolute policeman &quot; Gone Baby Gone (2007) &quot; and the thriller &quot; The town &quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film of Affleck that does not take place in its city of origin, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place constitutes one of the characteristics which put his first films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck also shows this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran &quot; &quot;kept&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film take place on streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and happening unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, is spelt a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictitious stages (the wrong team of filming in the bazaar of Teheran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much actions in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The movie director had to content himself with a subject giving in fact only few palpitating stages, in the film sense of term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He takes out very well, he sometimes tops up elements some in reality and there, result is not always so elegant (the stage in which the threat of crisis in the airport of Teheran is moved aside by a phone call in America and chase on the airstrip is rather far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo domiciles in its dissipated character, due to the necessity to show too much events in too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are completely delightful in their role of Hollywood collaborators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far off, the only ones in that case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film of Affleck misses a little of dramatic tension, it is allowed to see with a moderate interest, by appreciating realisation and style imitating the styles of an earlier period of the seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> He draws the spectator away, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As recall of a history still, in a sense, incomplete this day, and as illustration of the character exaggerated by the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it suits. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to fill balls, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which leads every year a public investigation into the most absurd banking expenses, decided, currently, to throw the competition of the regulations or of ideas from &quot;the workshop EU&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU plans, recently, to adopt a quota of 40 feminine percent for the direction of the big European firms was at the origin of our decision&quot;, declared for the newspaper Pr√°vo the organizer of this inquiry, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among mentioned absurdity, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the bonuses of insurance for the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now however, the women were favoured as for the rates of insurance on life because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can signal until end of year quite other such an incredible idea of &quot;the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;Vote will take place by the end of the month of February, 2013&quot;, informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add elements bio to fuels, what has harmful consequences as environment, or ban to use reliable thermometers with mercury, only because they contain a relatively weak quantity of a dangerous substance or else the directive concerning the size of the animal boxes of the hens, what drew away the price increase of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics were also issued in the past contrary to de facto ban to use expression &quot;butter to spread&quot; or the withdrawal of the sale of the classical bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas have to have a 14-centimetre size. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby from which requests are habitually defended in Brussels by a State or a State group (so the Czech Republic imposes currently requests of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas have to be a lower size in 14 cm nor introduce a &quot;abnormal curve&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising not homogeneous national norms which complicated trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Norms concerning fruits and vegetables were softened up in spite of the opposition of some States, pretending that existent directives draw away a wasting of foodstuffs. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first price will be is possible be awarded in this inquiry in the regulations of the EU of last year according to which must appear on the inflatable balls a warning pointing out that the children of less than 8 years have not to swell without adults&apos; surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU referred to an American inquiry according to which balls are, among toys, the first reason of decease of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to the children of less than 14 years as for blowing in trumpet players of fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> At our place also, there are strange ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule concerning the European civil servants themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, every person having an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and owes, on the place, the dialect of FYROM (Form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot; Laissez Faire &quot; regrouping liberal economists, the server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com named in this inquiry, besides some absurdity mentioned above, the regulations of the Union concerning the volume of the reservations of foodstuff on the territory of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had fixed the maximum volumes for the reservations of foodstuff that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our membership to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, volumes fixed for mushrooms in preserve and risked, so, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this inquiry judged interesting the idea of pouring amounts of money with some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to ask for the conferment of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas are not however originally from Brussels but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;Fact not to have sea handicaps us. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We are going to ask the European Union for a refund&quot;. So expressed himself, in autumn, 2004, the minister of the Agriculture of epoch Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He deduced that, due to our production of wheat, and further to said purchases &quot;Interventionnistes&quot;, l&apos; State had been with full supplies which he had had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU would have had to pour us of millions of euro, because the Czech Republic is far from harbours. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> When all is said and done, the European Commission answered Czech request positively and organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for the getting of subsidies were offered in villages by the ministry of the local Development run by the minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU), these had to, in concrete terms, serve for writing requests of subsidies granted by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU declares: &quot;the strange regulations are rare&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If regulations often provoke critics in Member states, according to many experts, efforts displayed by HAD in regulation and improvement of the effectivit√© of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development, deserve praises rather. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of subsidies of the EU for plans which absolutely have got nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but that were imposed by Member states during budgetary negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic has to, as other countries of the Union, fight in Brussels for right to use names specific for these products traditional (struggles from which she does not always take out victor) provokes deep emotions at the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs defended name successfully &quot;Olomouck√© tvar  √æ ky&quot;, for what of the appellation &quot;Tuzemsk √Ω rum&quot; which goes back up at our place to the XIXth century, our producers had to replace it with name &quot; Tuzem√°k &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only products based on alcohol of sugar of cane, and not based on sugar of beetroot, can carry the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of products recorded by the EU, the cookies of Karlovy Vary (&quot; Karlovarsk√© suchary &quot;), the carpi of Poho≈ôelice and of T≈ôebo are found together with cheeses world-famous as Feta or Gorgonzola, marzipan cake of L√ºbeck or ham of Parma today, ≈à (&quot;Poho≈ôelick √Ω has T≈ôebo≈àsk √Ω kapr&quot;) and the hop of ≈Ωatec (&quot;≈Ωateck √Ω chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The bread of spice of Pardubice (&quot;Pardubick √Ω pern√≠k&quot;) and called cakes &quot;Cones of Ho≈ôice&quot; (&quot; ho≈ôick√© trubiƒçky &quot;) can also be proud of their Community mark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want that I save the Republic, but I am only an amateur, declares senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mister Senator, how have they the idea of coming in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not to be senator or president who counts for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything worked without problems in our country, I would be candidate nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I do not any more support to see as the country is ransacked for these twenty last years, when the thieves are not under bolts and taxes and age of departure in retirement augment. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become politicking. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that not to me plait not, then I try to bring a solution so that this changes. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I am more than forty years old and that I am independent, member of no party, I do not have other solutions to influence situation than to introduce me in presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered the Senate but you set off fast for the Castle (N.d. T.: seat of the presidency). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do not you turn the back so to those who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that I will launch into battle for the Castle according to the results of senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I added that if I was elected senator, I would come in presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My purpose is not function, this one is only an instrument allowing me to accomplish my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need the biggest influence and the broadest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> Problem is not only that as nation we grumble in the bar or in front of our television set, but it is as as we trample cough those who try to bring change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To it is added the press which breaks the reputation of the persons and merges freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> They maintained, for example, in my purpose that I buy the journalists off or that I was the adviser of Ji  √≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let us come from it to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You started struggle for the Castle with as hobbyhorse the topics of the material and criminal responsibility of the politicians and of retrospective tax statements beyond twenty millions [of CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You must change law to this end. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such power and alone the Senate as a whole can offer laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to resolve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as citizen, I lobbied so that the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I got benefit of reason. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Problem it is the politicaillerie: when somebody arrives from left or from right with a good plan, this one is knowingly refused and this postpones the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As independent, member of no party, I have much more chances to get the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and partisan dogma, to take of every party what there is a better as our country and to apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You consider yourself rather to be a man of right or of left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From a Czech point of view, I have an impression that people put me rather to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that it is a bit to the left or to the right, it is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, importing him it is because we went forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, it is not that people are of left or right but to gather people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is offered by the Communist Party or ODS and I act also fairly contrary to bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you flare up when somebody says about you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you declared him does not prove him? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you work a business out plan in a firm, you also have some optimum purpose and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to get closer to it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some people can call this of Populism, but all proposals about which I speak were applied by the world and admitted experts spoke about it. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the Parliament, you have only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You will not survive for a long time in politics with it. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you are going to see people and speak to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I do not have other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> It is necessary me to persuade the politicians, journalists and public opinion and to try to rally them to my camp to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast my request straight on television to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of the politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then explain possibly why they do not bear a grudge. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there will be a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to lobby on the political stage. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Get for example the election of the president from direct suffrage, it was got thanks to the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, without beating around the bush, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just launched in politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try, alone, to improve matters, and so that doesn&apos;t work, I will stop in six years and I will go back to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is little as though Okamura had to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a rescuer. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that the single person cannot tell difference, that is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come also on senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because of working quantity. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I supported at least the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencov√° who revealed fraud in the oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I came because people are really discontented but supporting I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty for hundred people did not vote and for what made it gave their voice, mostly, to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> To the Senate, we are only independent two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People elected a Senate which will hardly be able to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nonetheless, I will struggle for my vision, for example election in the direct suffrage of the mayors and of the prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to found your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, yet, because I have no time to prove if the past of every potential member is stainless and then I have of it no medium financiers. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not either money as my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my &quot;transparent&quot; count. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You do not have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You speak about tax statements, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I estimate at about 60 millions the value of my movable property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have in Prague a ground worth 25 millions, a flat worth ten millions, another flat worth 8 millions, a collection of works of art worth about ten millions, one Aston Martin who is worth 3,5 millions and one ≈† koda Superb worth 1 million and millions on my count. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Is said by passing, I have one Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I always loved James Bond, who ran by car, was gallant with the women and fought against trouble and abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You run in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 millions and you have not money as your countryside? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money there? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very persuasive. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have not 15 millions as this countryside. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2 and a half millions in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows well that my programme does not provoke a big interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I have no obligation to pay this countryside of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My expenses of countryside are covered on the whole by the remuneration which I will receive as senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live on it, for example pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only objective was to make money, I will come on no election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You are therefore going to continue your commercial activities to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Had not you maintained that you would put your activities on the sly? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not linked to the sum of this remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised it, I partly reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take in spring the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> I have however well to live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your habitual monthly wage when you were businessman? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue winning between 200 four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I was president, I would put an end to my commercial activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in the edition of Saturday of the newspaper Pr√°va. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the office MVRDV prove that true adventures are not only affair of imagination. To persuade itself of it, it is enough to consider Spijkenisse and the newly established mountain of books - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find that this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see&quot;, to us said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the shoulder of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a big neighbouring firm, says to us: &quot;Yes, he is really very nice, this building&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we even need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everybody has Internet, an iPad and from e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, more anybody goes willingly to one of these dated libraries, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory town with nothing attractive near Rotterdam, holds a rather particular record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The village of 80,000 souls shows the weakest rate of education of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To give again some neurons to brains, the city decided, some years ago, to contribute to the general knowledge and to reproduce seven fictitious bridges which appear on the tickets of euro in the form of pretty miniature babies in painted ferroconcrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> That&apos;s how the authorities of the city belong return counts that there was only the single way of taking back the hand on statistics: the building of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of architects&apos; office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrammes in audacious sticks and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted plan with his habitual phlegm and came in competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a sniggering on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jurors still looked, disconcerted and shrugging shoulders, Maas, the perky, piled his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended its speech supported with activist arguments by one: &quot;dear village!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain flew of earth. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building registers in a plan of revitalisation also including an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and dividing houses for a total of 50 houses. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second price &quot;BEST LIBRARY OF NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Besides, plan was chosen for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> That&apos;s how this small lifeless small town, which untill today had nothing furthermore to give that a pedestrianized zone postmoderne and a city council of a bewildering ugliness, of that the white facades invite to think that they shelter a dairy, became rich of a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important, it is because Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long way towards reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: El Dorado of the book under bell with cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Certainly, a lift transports you in the middle of the massif, but the true joy of reading and of architecture opens you when you mill on the soil of the building in the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Inside entirely made by glass is luminous and clear, the soil in Dutch bricks and reflect them elegant speak without ambiguity the language of the local public places. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> They already search that the look of benches, the dogs and the small boys and the small girls who play ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and still books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the rays of library are along the facade and in the middle a big and dark room is, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal&quot;, explains Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We completely confused space shape classical and opened the areas of reading of inside towards the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inside of the mountain of books was capably done up: in the middle are offices, Internet library, club of chess, the centre for environment and technical power station of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty domiciles in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panels, sometimes balustrades, sometimes ramps of staircase. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for view, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and the hardened engineers of the building do not want unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials&quot;, explains Joop Trouborst, leader of plan to the village of Spijkenisse, in an answer to Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> That&apos;s how one day we found in a Friesian agricultural firm a waste product ad hoc coming from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, they use many years the synthetic membrane of one millimetre in thickness as substrate in conservatories and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and they gain time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The fine membrane is used during one or two seasons, then it is possible to throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates four centimetres in thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of heat and of pressure, &quot; Landbouwplastic &quot; (KPL) changes colour and is transformed into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which recalls at the same time a new car and shoes of sports. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> In the top of 105 walk the summit of the mountain is. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee gives us an impregnable view on the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficuses in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These last create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintaining of the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is incredible, but in spite of all glass surfaces, this building is a model plan in ecology&quot;, entrusts Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermics. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Though the mountain of books is underneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates only not enough time inside, even days of fine weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams taken up by foible in comparison with the glass facade act as visor, intercepting a lot of rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The surrounding atmosphere is very nice. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The completely automated blinds take responsibility besides. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, already dared to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also has already been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, describes even Boekenberg as &quot;finally found soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Some weeks ago indeed, during unveiling, every citizen was invited to give a book coming from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This measure allowed to fill up spaces of the library which was not still completely trimmed (today, it counts 70,000 books). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> Concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Rays overflow from everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a half empty library.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that our invitation created some relation between every citizen and this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Each knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> That&apos;s how MVRDV attained the chief discipline which is called, in professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Even if she can seem young and not much educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is finally about a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans have to play a bigger role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany chose abstention during vote on the admission of the Palestinian State. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention of voting against the request of the Palestinians to get State status observer to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she then chose abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis made in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must show caution, because it maintains particular relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that she does not support American position either. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, without proving however to be too critical towards Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During insurrection in Libya of March, 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention during vote on the installation of a zone of air exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Does Germany feel difficulties in adopting a clear position regarding big international questions? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Reason is there that Berlin is seeing again its foreign policy, trying to move away from a politics as one might say defined by the Americans and to institute a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Besides, the lack of common and consistent politics within the Union complicates situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans collide therefore with several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They expect from them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think that they still scrabble to find this role, but are on the way of a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What means then in concrete terms the term of &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> She shows the will to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including as regards the national files. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I think that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by export and its relations with some regions, as Russia, China or Near East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> German economic interests are different, to a certain extent, from those of other Great Powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Did these economic interests influence the position of Germany in relation to conflict in Near East and abstention during the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has important markets first in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why Berlin must watch out not to hit public opinion, but also elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is unquestionably about a decisive element there. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I would not grant too much importance there, because it is not about exclusively unilateral relation. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is anyway an element there determining in German strategical reflexion. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention during important polls, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that the Europeans and the Americans understand German position perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of Libyan question it. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even what is more Germany will be only more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany so showed as she must be taken seriously as international actor and as its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, opinions concerning Palestinian initiative are various. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On the contrary, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of the European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There was difference always because of the stage American domestic policy. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration secretly shows a big understanding towards European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But having seen the political shape of the country, the government cannot defend its position of course publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think that true difference of opinions is not so big as they always appear him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you notice relations between Obama and the Israeli prime minister Netanyahou, you will point out that Obama is far from going beyond enthusiasm regarding the politics of Netanyahou. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does Germany feel difficulties in reconciling its narrow relations with Israel and the United States, on one hand, with the position of the big European partners, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that this does not make things easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a consistent and uniform European politics, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot therefore register within a larger political line and have to assert their peculiar position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> It is what they make currently in the question of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will take in future a role of engine and push Europe to adopt an European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not simple for Germany, notably because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question was always delicate. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But according to me, the Germans are well conscious due to the fact that they have to play a role which marks their independence more. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Is Germany seen playing a role of weighty actor on the international stage, Germany only wants to take a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or has she always difficulties in taking leading roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed to it, it is always uncomfortable to it and, for obvious reasons, the country always feels difficulties in playing a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If the crisis of the euro is looked, for example, they point out that each time Germany decides to weigh more, many antiGerman feelings make themselves heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> √áa ne facilite pas les choses pour les Allemands. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be encircled of hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Of this point view, Germany is in a position more delicate than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> She must compromise with neighbours and opinions very various, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at present, the EU does not fill this space up, then who does there remain? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if this does not please them, even if this is unpleasant to them and if they are only less appreciated, that&apos;s life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy manager of Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and experts in politics of Europe and of North America analyse together the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also member of German marshal Fund, where he specialised in German politics, in American foreign policy and in transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of marks&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren marks known across the world are. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo that is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name a registered trademark officially in China hides, but which has got nothing to do with the original firm. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Mark enjoys so a protection such as the firm which has the name am not possible lodge a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if she could him, he is not sure that she would get benefit of reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is more and more difficult for the foreigners to protect their marks in China&quot;, explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the office Taylor Wessing specialised in violation of the right of possession in Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new file arrives on my office. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators need only some additional letters to be able to record their marks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So, instead of Gucci, they record Read - Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German firms have the producer copied also legally, as Puma, of sports equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which is recording performed to the service of the marks of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese firm deposited leading Zegna DF Puma, a name which the business company artificially created by appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the home of mode. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chineses became the World champions of the copy and of the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, they find that shopping centres on several floors which sell practically only counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Cases of Pattloch however differ: his principals make him responsible for attacking the fact that the Chinese service of marks confers right officially on the Chinese firms to use a name which is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chineses speak about &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, about mark resemblance. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Term is diverted from &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are indicated the women who get married to rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities tell they have nothing to blame themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, it is necessary to struggle against this tendency&quot;, Pattloch demands. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Mark is sweetened, singularity disappears, damage for reputation is huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and expenses of justice amount in millions for the concerned sectors, especially as regards the expensive key products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the data of the society of analysis of the market CLSA, China represents, with an annual 15 thousand million euro volume, the third worldwide market of luxury products and the one who develops most faster. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to remove doubtful recording of the register of marks and these procedures cost a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These last can last until nine years, and exit is never sure. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch mentions trials during which the court rejected complaint, because after long period, criticised name had become a &quot;reality of the market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch explains us that if the complainant does not have chance, he can even be obliged to transfer money to the plagiarist, because he would have nui in his mark in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this domain, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also concern graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the constructor of machine of construction site Sany, the same firm which had just bought back the producer of pomps with concrete Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> It is the reason for which the Chineses can use an emblem which resembles the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the acquisiteur of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo which reminded of that of BMW. Conflict was regulated and Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The home of mode Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and of Singapore who had reorientated the look of the famous crocodile in compared direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The service of marks CTMO in Beijing however allows to have known some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and of space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, service would have passed last year of a &quot;urgent situation in the holding of job to a found normality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the number of the untreated procedures of opposition would have gone down by 22 %. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> About 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, what represents a 75 % increase in comparison with the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain unclaimed in service. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To act costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, figures are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, CTMO received 1,4 more than million requests of leading store, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to service, it is about a record and it means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the head of the classification for the number of new stores in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It would also be worth for the total number of lawful marks, which is 5,5 millions. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, service would have counted 1,8 thousand million of the yuan of registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, every recording brought back 1,280 on average yuan, or 160 euro. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle costs much more, as the famous the case of the German family firm Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the firm fights against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Certainly, the Germans could get that the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator could support his Chinese rights on mark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our error, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany&quot;, explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The service of marks had therefore rejected the objection of the Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg certainly got benefit of reason to both following authorities, but the opposite party continues fighting untill today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Alertness is of bet </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, affair is in authority to the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive exit of trial and extols the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, he adds: &quot;procedure is long, gruelling and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The service of archives even had to review the acts of hundred last years to bring proof. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even offered in vain in the opposite party a &quot;big sum in six-figure euro&quot; to regulate litigation. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It is in it that they see what it represents for us&quot;, entrusts Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Danger of the Far East threatens even to overflow until Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> It would be case if imitators of this region made sure the working of not protected marks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a firm of production of shoe and of leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The firm had left this sector for a long time, but she had been able nevertheless to prevent store. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;alertness is of bet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and recommend him the German firms to show a great caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, according to them, to trust the international law of marks, the foreigners should rather &quot;record also in China all that is likely to be protected&quot;, as said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, costs can be more important than those of recording. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost battle during the last act of the legal drama, the firm should pay rights of licence to the opposite party for the use of its own name, as explains it Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Where then, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Worldwide day of struggle counters the AIDS: tap the foot, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland are delighted with their visit. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Here is the history of a link which crosses much more than a 8,733-kilometre distance. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, they tap the foot: the boots of cowboy, basketball, court shoes for the ladies and moccasins for the men search rhythm by kicking the soil. Very quickly, they find him. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, voices of the singers grow slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they lose temper, bewitch and are in order. </seg>

<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos; Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every member of the chorus has different words, the whole in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a spoken language by 11 million persons in Southern Africa, in Botswana, in Lesotho, in the Malawi, in Mozambique and in some regions of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to use </seg>
<seg id="1713"> ONUSIDA, programme of the United Nations of struggle against the AIDS, thinks that 34 million persons across the world are attained of illness. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23,5 millions of them live in the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland counts 245,000 contaminated persons. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Besides, more than 40 % populations am seropositive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 orphans of the AIDS of the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association &quot; Voices for Africa &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them visit an establishment of secondary education. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euro by less, it is possible to become sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This sum guarantees to the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal for the centre sucker. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;storyteller of stories&quot; or still &quot;singer of commendations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak fluently the bantoue language in this region, but all can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For 10 years, the choir repeats songs in this foreign language which she brought in Germany to return her now to its native region: the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because in 8,733 bird&apos;s-eye kilometres in Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village which depends on the vocal power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40 % of attained persons </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village counts about 2,000 inhabitants, some people live in modest huts of straw or of earth and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 between them are orphans, because the HIV took their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni, it is possible to notice in smaller ladder the troubles which scourge Swaziland: the rate of infection in the highest HIV and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to the UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population accepts practically never the masculine male circumcision, a measure which however guarantees a reduction proved of the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 % populations of Swaziland is holder of the virus of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and it is not rare to die in the middle of around thirty. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a trip of group in Africa in spring on 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children on the street to which was missing not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothes, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without school certificate, there is no perspective simply. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the beginning, it was only about some persons who promised personally to pay some euro every year to be able to send a child to the school and to give him a hot meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely one year later, the choir melted &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, an association which takes care since then in an almost professional way of orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Made regarding the sexually transmissible infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among bacterial IST, syphilis, chlamydi√©es and gonorrhoea are counted (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Common IST is the HIV, the virus of human papilloma, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Lice of the pubes and scabies belong in parasitical IST. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the mainly concerned groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear at the men&apos;s with sexual relations with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert-Koch thinks that sexual contacts between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five declaring in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> At the heterosexual adults, infections linked to chlamydi√©es, trichomonase, candidiasis (fongique), gonorrhoea and virus of the human papilloma are common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of the HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20 % new infections in the HIV are noticed within this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> At the young people, they notice a rate of infections linked to chlamydi√©es appreciably higher than to other groups of population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European notings down, three quarters of all infections concern the young people from 15 to 25 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Besides, in Germany, the virus of the human papilloma is common to the young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is evolution among infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis more then doubled in 10 years: the figure passed from 1,967 to 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new infections in the HIV diminishes. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there was about 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It represents a reduction of a tenth in comparison with the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual illness? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of sexual organs, urinary pain, white losses, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of buttons and of warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they draw away regularly no pain or other symptom and remain therefore hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect itself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can diminish the risk of infection, but they do not protect in 100 %. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Reason is there that the pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on by lubricating infection or by narrow bodily contacts. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts recommend therefore to every person often changing sexual partners to take exams regularly. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most fast deflected IST can be cured and late consequences can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, to donations, but especially to funds which harvest the members of the chorus thanks to their voices across whole Germany, means pile up. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euro to Esitjeni&quot;, specifies Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman and who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also makes sure that the orphans are lodged well, to one of their big - mothers for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The suckers, that&apos;s how the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some people of them receive up to 14 orphans, they give them a roof and make sure whom they become every day at the hour to the school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has any more nobody is received in a sure place, to Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just as both cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Besides, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; created a school of sewing and allowed the building of two henhouses. With the help of the American organisation for health PSI, the association organised a test of screening of the HIV for many inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It does not go without saying, because even if illness is well visible in all country, she remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;The AIDS is a true taboo&quot;, explains Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is a subject which touches sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is rather curious, from a country 14 official wives of which the king has. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, the king Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These morals punished by the State, between others, are responsible for the quick spread of the HIV noticed these last decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The workers migrants also disseminated the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Condoms in every street corner are however found, adds Annette Lennartz, &quot;but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Culture differs, flesh counters flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To favour cultural exchanges a little, the members of the chorus of Imbongi go on a trip together both or three years in the South of Africa and start singing songs filled with nostalgia, with courage, with confidence and with black identity that number of inhabitants of the top of the black continent still knows the time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with whites which sing in Africain language is a sign of recognition such as it procreates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes moves to tears some formidable guards also border. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes them always in Esitjeni, where the members of the chorus visit their godsons. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a card, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there&quot;, say people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a 8,733-kilometre trip bird&apos;s-eye, back in Heidelberg, in front of these members of the chorus who tap the foot in the room of repetition of Bergheimer Stra√üe, light is also found. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe brought back proof of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The layer of ice could attain 20 metres in thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The American NASA space agency proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains the ice water, as explain it three studies published on Thursday in the specialised magazine &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe brought back proof of the existence of a cover of ice in the region of the planet permanently plunged into shadow. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres that can go up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water comes probably from comets or perhaps from asteroids which would have hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody makes link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can attain 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Discovery could help to include how the water and other elements essential for life arrived in other regions of solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unobserved of inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Every so often, they send pictures to the earth, such of small interspaces across which the infinity is noticed. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers of the Institute Max-Planck. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Eight planets of our solar system, as well as dwarf planet C√©r√®s. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> As Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, C√©r√®s is not considered to be a &quot;planet&quot;, according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomic Union of 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a &quot;portrait of family&quot; of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, the &quot;newborn babies&quot; in the delivery room of the world are. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The telescope Spitzer discovered this region where are born stars, called &quot;W5&quot;, a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiop√©e, in 6,500 light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The telescope Spitzer de la NASA photographed the flamboyant brightness of a star dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The circle in the form of doughnut is composed of elements which the star casts when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the huge nebula Trifide, in 5,400 light-years of the Earth, the gas and the dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic delivery room. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Groups, masses of stars also called seven sisters &quot;, can be noticed in the bare eye overnight. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope emphasises colours more. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this infrared photo, the nebula of Aircraft propeller, as a red eye, looks directly at the spectator. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> She is in 700 light-years in the constellation of the Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its resemblances to a continent of the Earth were worth it the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and of the infrared photo allows to notice a spectacular shade. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the infrared detectors of the telescope Spitzer could capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the biggest mysteries of astronomy concerns the creation of rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> A theory is that rings are the rests of a moon of Saturn which disappeared 4,5 thousand million years ago without leaving traces. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the most net and biggest photographs which takes the telescope Hubble is that of the galaxy of the Whirl. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to shade, photographs of galaxies spirals can become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, in several thousand light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of Trifide comes from Latin word &quot; Trifidus &quot; (divided, shared in three), because three trails of dust divide the heart shining with the place of birth of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The astronomers photographed the premises of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Serpentaire: in 400 million light-years of the Earth, cores of two galaxies in fusion rush the one to other one, collision is unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The telescope Hubble noticed the birth of these stars in the galaxy spiral M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of &quot;southern wheel of fire&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of C√©ph√©e. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is in 1,400 light-years and composed of smuts which are ten-hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was worked out from the optic and X-ray plates taken by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It is possible to see there the circle composed of the black holes which is in 430 million light-years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed Arp 273 for NASA this group of galaxies called. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists named the biggest galaxy spiral &quot;GC 1810&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula is the most luminous group of young stars of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are linked up by the nebula of the Rosette, create young stars so permanently in 5,000 light-years of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy in light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is not still dust, there is only some gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The scientists think that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the world was composed to a great extent of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our look on the world: the main telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by grunts Lipperhey, before Galileo should use it one year later to notice stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since, the mirrors of the optic telescopes did not cease growing and thanks to them, it was possible to see always farther in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> During 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Tows the Observatory of the mount Palomar near San Diego the biggest telescope of the world was. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this picture had a five-metre diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In the Arizona, in the United States, Broad Binocular Telescope is. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> He allows to notice the world across two mirrors having each a 8,4-metre diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Palma, in Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror in himself attains a 10,4-metre diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in Southern Africa was segmented to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter attains however about eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The disadvantage of the method of economic building is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, what limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also fixed at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His feature is fond of his big capacity of collection of light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> In spite of a diameter of relatively small mirror, this capacity gets closer to those from the biggest telescopes to mirrors of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> The scientists listen to the world in search of extraterrestrial signals with the aid of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a 305-metre diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Every person possessing a computer can help in &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI, or &quot;research of extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;) by putting in contribution the power of calculation of its machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Seen on the southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope (&quot; very big telescope &quot;), an installation worthy of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the medium infrared spectre. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The building of a very big European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also envisaged for the site of ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should attain the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of about 1,000 elements of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not be able to take plates before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, both telescopes of Keck on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered as the biggest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They sported two mirrors 10 metres in diameters to each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea which notices the sky with the telescope Subaru and IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new colossal telescope should be also constructed on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will attain 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration allows to admire him. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important pictures of the space come us from the space telescope Hubble. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24th, 1990, he delivers us pictures of the distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March, 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches exoplan√®tes, principally those who are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on February 2nd, 2011 when she had found 1,235 planets candidates since the beginning of mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo illustrates the last preparations before the launching of the space telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in the space at the earliest in 2018 on board of a rocket Ariane 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a 6,5-metre diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will notably have as mission to find the light cast by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists think that the South Pole of Mercury also shelters from the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data on this theory exist, because Messenger orbits much more near the North Pole of Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Data radars have pointed out for decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launching of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first one to be orbited around Mercury, the scientists are certain there now. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink some butter every day, and live until 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In the South of Azerba√Ødjan, many people attain ages worthy of patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> A museum of longevity is even found there. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An inquiry into a country, in which they are still relatively 97-year-old young person. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the South of Azerba√Ødjan, many people attain ages worthy of patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> A museum of longevity is even found there. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An inquiry into a country, in which they are still relatively 97-year-old young person. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip in mountains Talysh is of a Romanticism ruffled the hair. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> In the course of many turns of the road, the small bus bounces along along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fecund, they would think almost in they should be Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep South of Azerba√Ødjan, the border with Iran is only in some kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, regarding which they do not know much, if it is only they speak perfectly Persian and az√©ri and that they have a very big longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small city plastronne with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet epoch which agrees in no way with the landscape of picturesque mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The European tourists are rare here, the itinerary since the capital of Azerba√Ødjan, Baku, is very too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Eight hours are needed to go through 323 kilometres, because the road has only the only way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province did not use yet the legendary wealth which the country owes to its reservations of oil in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is persuaded that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku next year became famous in May thanks to the competition of the Eurovision, and, there will be here the festival of the oldest persons of the world&quot;, explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is guiding of the museum of longevity, the only museum suchlike in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> It is possible to discover life there about eight dozens Talysh of the region which are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here is my grandfather, he attained the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Have another 136-year-old child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is not however birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when they think that the oldest researched person was 122 years old, the age of M√ºsl√ºmov seems more than doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He is born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973&quot;, definite Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man would have three times got married and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136 years, he would have still conceived a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> would ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov have made a mistake about some decades by calculating the age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in the Institute Max-Planck of Rostock, also heard him about the man in the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Surprisingly old persons also live in some regions of China, in Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan&quot;, explains Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia also, there are men who live terrifically old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof because of the nonexistence of documents, without counting that there was not register of registry office. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of well-blended butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> He is nevertheless indeed that people of the region of Lerik often attain an age worthy of patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 persons are more than 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> What is therefore the reason of longevity in the South of this country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist az√©ri guide, explains that Talysh has particular genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the head of the museum, thinks that it is a question of feeding. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem credible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorific meals of Talysh, which like the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and among which many people every day have a drink of well-blended butter, are good for health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple way of life which preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the city of Lerik, lived Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With her 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who asserts having 143 descendants, saw in a modest wooden home, as it is typical to see it in all region of the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting down on the soil next to a churn, contents of which she beats tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight persons live here under the single roof, among whom one of the threads of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are grown-up for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children also gambol in the home. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, some tea for the guests served in armadus typical glasses in the form of belly is prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly lined up, and under the scarf long plaits of a dark fair-haired man hide which his son reveals us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always washed my hair with some milk, and that&apos;s how I have never lost them and that they kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo&quot;, adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly retirement is enough for living </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and green peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Of all my life, I have never bought the slightest food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she speaks to us about her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst instants were after World War II. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything improved when the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev&quot; took orders. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the worship of the paternal face of the nation, a man who however ran his country as a dictator, not connait almost no borders in Azerba√Ødjan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him later. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Anyhow, the old persons of Azerba√Ødjan do not know distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives 230 manat monthly (about the same sum as in euro) for the retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps that the son for a long time grizzled of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;the elder enjoy a great respect in our culture&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the big family, they are loved, treated and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Here is a good reason to live as longer as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;Human rights&quot; skipped in Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Revolution comes back to life in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The plan of constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not laconic filled with emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must achieve transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is of my responsibility towards the people and God&quot;, he declared on State television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was intended for the people entirely, but also especially in Coptic Christian, to the Liberals, nondenominational and lighted Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of hopelessly divided and confused opposition are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi declared, almost by apologising, to have provisionally restrained competences of the Constitutional court and to enlarged his &quot;to save revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world really do not know what wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, holder of a doctorate of the American university of California of the South. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judicial power be overturned? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> 234 articles written hastily by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 persons during a nocturnal feat of fifteen hours are really worrying to a certain extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, plan envisages that the case law is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what really means word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and it always remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the islamists use vague formulation and legal room for manoeuvre which follows from it to apply a more strict interpretation of the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> Anyway it is because deal to think of a newly introduced article stipulating that, as regards all subjects touching the sharia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution of the country and its brightness beams on everybody Islamic Sunni. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It can, but willy-nilly does not mean that the clergy will watch the legislative apparatus, what would draw away de facto the bet under tutelage of judicial power. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the plan of Constitution are material with interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the probable maintaining of military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Moubarak, these courts applied themselves to suppress the opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were kept by the servicemen. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State also must, it is possible to read in plan, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to promote its morality and its stocks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally, formulation is so vague as the institutions of the State could even control the contents of art cinematography and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, it would be simply about censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Besides, no article guarantees equality expressly between the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead of this, another article forbidden to offend or to traduce the prophet Mohammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> On the contrary, the article does not define what is an offence nor how she must be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also doubtful is formulation giving to understand that it is forbidden &apos;&quot;to offend the persons&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are therefore material with interpretation in the plan which Morsi subjects to vote and that, according to its own words, will make &quot;very soon&quot; the object of a referendum to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;Renait revolution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Opposition rallies for weeks against the numerical superiority of the islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> On Friday evening, dozens thousand demonstrators gathered in an unusual friendship on the place Tahrir in Cairo, promising to make the sharia fall before it comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;Revolution comes back to life and we are going to win&quot;, throws Hamdin Sabbahi, arrived third at presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel prize of peace and ex-leader of the international Agency of nuclear energy Mohamed El Baradei declared that the plan of Constitution is &quot;to throw into the garbage cans of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the service of instantaneous freight forwarding, he accused the supporters of Morsi of wanting to foment a &quot;putsch against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims referendum, they will go to his palace and he will be overturned&quot;, cries Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not still tired, does not pay one yet for the blood of our brothers&quot;, declared according to Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Besides, several judges announced not to want to watch referendum, what would draw its nonentity away. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our Constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For his/her part, brotherhood Muslim, well organised, called to a counter-demonstration not on the place Tahrir by measure of precaution, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a big request was organised in front of the university of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The veiled women and the supporters of salafistes, who participated in it in large number, scanned: &quot;the people claim the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Clean our country!&quot;, they asked Morsi, by maintaining that &quot;the Koran [was them] Constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A battle for sovereignty on the symbolism place Tharir, where everything began, would have quickly procreated a similar situation in that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, it is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brothers declared that the opponents to the plan of Constitution, in the same capacity as his supporters, had expressed themselves high and extremely. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, he is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes of direction which the country must take. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The plan of the islamists will indeed win the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not only once mentioned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angered against this constitutional imposed process which should have persisted until February and to include all social force. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organisation of human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before courts under Moubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He made it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> It is the reason for which he was pounded on, judged and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, term is not even pronounced once in new Constitution&quot;, he regrets in the course of his maintenance with Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of Morsi to three powers discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant attacks in the rules of democracy and they will procreate a new dictatorship in √âgypte. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of reinforcing the society, the president removes him de facto all his powers&quot;, deplores Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, a democracy cannot work without organisations of the society. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and of nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> It could have to be paid. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A demonstrator on the place Tharir warns: &quot;you give birth to a monster which it will not be possible to you any more to control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk of Norway: is it about the most odorous fish of the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Five million persons who populate Norway benefit from one of most high standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of places for an extremely odorous fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take advanced cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty clothes of football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait one week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of the dishes most appraised by Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small city of Fagernes, in about 3 am Oslo time. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It is snowing, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impregnates air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is made up of trout dredged with salt and fermented in the water during a length - according to the smell which you want that he exhales - who can go until one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness becomes established and what it is cold, the Norwegians gather as a whole to attend a festival which takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat crude, then you swallow a glass of aquavit&quot;, explains Havard Halvarsen, local fireman full-time that they also call &quot;Rakfisk General&quot;, responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people swallow fragments of fish and guzzle down a big quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some persons prefer the aquavit to the rakfisk&quot;, adds Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it is not bad - it makes think of a sushi who would have passed of the long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk goes back up to an epoch when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was submerged in airtight barrels of water in air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, in the course of the winter, once fermented well, the fish went out and - unquestionably with senses minimised by the alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find job, emigrating mainly towards the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Currently, the population develops fast - more than 13 % are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and complete system of health. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was him has there so for a long time richer than no Norway, cross border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although odorous, of the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It makes left the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - small one pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 ‚Ç¨ each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway often does not make speak about it in international news, what is not to dissatisfy it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to speak about Anders Breivik, the extremist racist of right who slaughtered 77 persons, among whom women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they recall this slaughter, they speak about &quot;the incident of July 22nd&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of theirs could make such barbarous deed. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the beginning of the seventies, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But the oil is not the unique reason which justifies our success&quot;, explains Anna, our waitress, in blonde hair and in eyes of a piercing blue, picture of Nordic ease, with a set of rakfisk at the hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how tell yourselves - careful persons. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, as that of most people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not like to draw attention. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - everything, except for a weak percentage of money coming from this industry, is invested in a special fund to the advantage of the future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries threw the money by windows, in the course of the years which drove to us in international financial crisis, Norway could keep the cords of its grant gripped well. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as it is possible to ski in winter and to make the walking in summer, we are happy&quot;, specifies Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk&quot;, she adds in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand under the snow and I queue up to sell of what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> In the menu, a hamburger composed of impetus, a true discovery, it is very good. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But this evening, the smell of the fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where they act as the rakfisk to have dinner and where it is possible to vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a programme of TV where the newscaster carries a n≈ìud-papillon encircled with plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> They would imagine in the competition of the Eurovision. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What score did you give to the best fish, in mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Points de No. de Voici, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Laughs and applauses are heard. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Where perhaps it is because of emanations of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the President entering Enrique Pena Nieto gets ready to take up his posts in Mexico, Will Grant, from BBC, is interested in difficulties which wait for him and in waitings of the people, which are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in usual time, a dam of security was set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing a real chaos on roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, objective was not to prevent the persons from going to their job, but from preventing the demonstrators from attaining the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task waits for him. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The economy of Mexico goes well, of results which are owed to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a war of the drug which has already cost life to about 60,000 persons in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government made commitment towards the Mexican people to reduce violence&quot;, declared Mr Pena Nieto to the American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a bit earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to offer a new strategy in security which will allow us to hit the mark. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before being next to the president American, Mr Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populated and tentacular state which fits tightly round the capital. On his earth of predilection, opinions concerning this new leader are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the common bucolic of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is registered in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Places allocate him the development of tourism and of facilities in the village. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To join the city, you can learn news motorways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement was brought in these roads, in the past dented and full of crack. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates sporting its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum devoted to climatic change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We count on him to set lasting changes up&quot;, declared his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and of the party of M Pena Nieto, PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and of economy notably, we hope for a true change which our country so much needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without fault in power, PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of the congress Olvera supposes that after 12 last years except the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of waitings within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects the critics of the opponents who reproach the new president for lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It is a very hired, whole man, with a very good vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a very good State man and, on top of everything, he can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, it is not always the picture which have people of their ancient governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with streets laid with cobblestones by Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the overpasses of motorways, she constitutes, in many respects, suburbs of the city of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in year, the servicemen were called to rescue to struggle against the gangs of drug who clamp down in districts, and acts of violence made to the women are there particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a stricken zone, they found, next to discharge, the bodies of dozens women assassinated in the course of two last years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a notorious place for the number of innocent women who were killed there. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The detractors of Mr Pena Nieto, say that at best, he did not succeed in confining the problem of murders perpetrated against the women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst, they accuse its administration of refusing to see reality opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a home in concrete, typical of this dilapidated district, Irinea Buendia struggles for keeping its tears when she shows me photos of its late daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> Official version mentions a suicide made by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, its family thinks that she was killed by its partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at home, it seemed to me that its body had been washed&quot;, tells Se√±ora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs pointed out that she had been beaten, and rigour mortis was already begun. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells story, Mariana&apos;s photo dresses the wall, next to a cross where appears word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, it is exactly what the family saw itself refusing. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Authorities treated me as though I was an old gossips, a troublemaker of confusion, a sniveller. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want that they accept what they say and that they are silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal that there are so much irregularities and omissions&quot;, she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When the president Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Dozens thousand families were touched by crime in Mexico in the course of six last years and the new president made promise that he would make his priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that he will be also good as president as when he was governor&quot;, declared Olvera, to Valle del Bravo, congressman. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza most fear. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, declare the prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutors try to counter the claims of maltreatment victim of which Bradley Manning would have been during detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> Trial concerns the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Defence wants to close the affair in motive which the sequestration of Manning made in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of having hidden the thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The prosecutors tried to show, on Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being at the origin of the biggest escape of confidential information of all history of the American army - missed many occasions to complain mistreatment which he pretends to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary audience in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein maintained that recording of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his to be new month of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaint concerning its treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Cross-examination - in the course of audience, defence introduced a request demanding that affair Manning is classified in motive that sequestration was made in very difficult conditions and constituted a strict enough punishment - took place one day after Manning manifested the desire to commit suicide during the detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This analyst of military information, stopped in June, 2010, is accused of having hidden the thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Documents were then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the audience of Friday, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during its detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July, 2010 till April, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers asked questions in Manning and recorded its answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein recalled forms, on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment which reserved for it his guards was &quot;very good&quot; and what the treatment which he had had within the prison was on the whole &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Forms mention no complaint for mistreatment, good that the officers directly question it about its prison treatment, asserted Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning answered that he had orally expressed concerns concerning some problems and that the officers on visit had discussed its concerns and pointed out that they would take care of it, but they did not record recalled problems. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote &quot; no problem &quot; (having approached concerns), and therefore, it did not mean that I had not raised problems&quot;, declared Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Collar. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a maintenance in January, 2011 with the special committee which had met to recall the suicidal thoughts which he had expressed in writing some months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning answered that its intention during meeting a &quot;risk of wound was to make change its limitative status pointing out&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The servicemen declared that they had allocated him this limitative status - a level underneath the surveillance brought closer for risk of suicide - for its protection and the security of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted that the personnel knows that I went well, and I wanted that this status is withdrawn me to benefit from a better quality of life of my point of view&quot;, declared Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified on Thursday on the arrest in Iraq and the transfer to Kuwait, where he was kept during almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the Body of the Marines to Quantico, in Virginia, in July, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He declared to have planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and to have once fainted because of heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that fact not to have been kept up to date on what it is going to happen to him or from what took place in the rest of the world was very frightening. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this animal box&quot;, declared Manning, Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought that I am going to die in this animal box. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once in Quantico, Manning declared that it had passed most clearly in his/her time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only objects which he had were a mattress, a cover, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He tried to stay in movement, because to sleep or to remain lengthened during day was opposite to the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also added that when he tried to sleep, it had a light in eyes, lighted outside the cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see the face when it turned round at night, they awakened him to be able to see the face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning lodged a definite complaint for treatments suffered by Manning in January, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was put in a military prison in Strong Leavenworth, Kansas, in April, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday also, the judge asked questions in Manning concerning an allegation brought back in his evidence of Thursday - that having been forced to sleep bare the whole night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to be held bare in front of the guards and other prisoners a morning, during call. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning manifested that at no instant, it was allowed to him to become covered with a cover during call. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questions of the judge, on Friday, Manning declared that he had deducted in the order of his guard that he had to drop the cover which would have been able to hide the nakedness, but he admitted that nobody had ordered him to drop it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning manifested on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep bare previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that it was not a danger for itself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning would have declared to the officer that he would have been able to use the rubber band of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not made him. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning manifested that the underwear, the flip-flops, and the glasses had been withdrawn from the cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account experiments which he lived during his detention and that he will reduce his sentence considerably if he must be admitted to be guilty in front of a court-martial, a trial which should be held early in the year next. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Defence declared that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other expenses considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Audience should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should deduce that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations which govern the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Counts of indictment carried contrary to Manning include the flight of property or public documents, conspiracy with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of information relating to national defence. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all counts of indictment are kept, he incurs imprisonment with perpetuity. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My mexico-American self-defining crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans have tendency to criticise those who left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult periods, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that Mexico Cities-Americans find themselves taken between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, by arriving in the foyer, in front of the services of customhouse and of immigration, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Panels pointed two ways out: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans &quot;), other one for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I remained immobile during several seconds, not knowing to what queue to run me. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew in the centre of the California, where all my life was called me the &quot;Mexican&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is about an ethnic qualifier, in the same capacity as the one that my friends of Boston use when they tell themselves &quot;Irish &quot;, or my friends of New York when they tell themselves &quot;Italian &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then, I became &quot;Mexico City-American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the earth which saw being born my grandfather, no need of special qualifier nor of hyphen. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, well enough to manage a maintenance in the one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I have no vocabulary of a native, and I cannot lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Then I took my American passport and I headed for the queue &quot;Foreigners&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at this instant of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the president Obama, the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their topics of predilection are immigration, drug and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto also felt like speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons which push the Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than to venture in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to form an alliance with the United States and with Canada, and to create an Union for trade like the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto promises to follow war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he does not give more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States pervaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over the half of their territory in the top of the gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> As a result, as soon as OFFICIAL U.S formulates the slightest criticism regarding Mexico, you begin hearing - in the Mexican press, and among elites - complaints on the way the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma search the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And however, for Mexico, the most difficult relation is the one that the country maintains with most than 35 million from Mexico Cities-Americans which live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want that the subject of bitterness is approached? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winning and its losers, persons for whom the country gives opportunities and others for whom the country does not give it. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason which explains the big number of Mexican ancestors in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a big - parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most often, this person corresponded to a profile portray - a dark skin, of little education, coming from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal towards them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we live currently the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream which we live, and not that of Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes flustered, but our fidelity is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We grant him in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that a part of Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Feeling is reciprocal. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them of a mortifying defeat and they look up and us down as though we were native individuals lower and not enough Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will be never rather good, our links with Mexico will be never rather strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would have never left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not find ourselves wedged by the good side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but since lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife who is born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States while she was child, reminds me that there are frictions between the Mexicans and Mexico Cities-Americans, because the Mexicans demand their identity more firmly and Mexico Cities-Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although she is American citizen, she has feeling to be part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Moreover, many Mexico Cities-Americans which I know do not feel being part of a country or of other one. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in none of two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are considered to be Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are considered to be Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate relation a little more, as I learnt him during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want that Mexico Cities-Americans work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, by representing its interests to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country which it is absolutely necessary to visit and to put pressure to the political leaders to reinforce links with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It will not arrive. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if they consider that inequality of wage, corruption and violence linked to the drug who are omnipresent, many of us are not persuaded that it is about a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to manage only, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not although ready to excuse the United States of the way they treated Mexico one and a half century ago, they have to accept as a result that some Mexico Cities-Americans always bear a grudge against them of the way the members of their family were treated there is not so for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexican &quot; than I thought of it. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas is another failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will not he be able ever to have there a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed seems to point out that such hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While the same trivial arguments persist to know who began, dozens buildings were reduced in dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them support civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets drawn by Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab spring made everything shatter, and that it is wanted or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional confusion. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps that their struggle will intensify still a little more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are all reasons to think that it could help them to go out of this lethal dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war which makes no loser and any winning </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if ceasefire granted on November 21st stays, battles of this week reinforced the supporters of force, on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement which runs Gaza since 2007, will claim of having forced the Israelis to leave, even if Gaza wiped one scraped clean. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> To have killed some of its leaders and forced back 1,7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most poor and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel did not succeed in destroying the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, the Hamas gains ground on the West Bank of Jordan, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Besides, the leaders of the Hamas could tell themselves that the time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of the islamists of the Arab world is more and more strong, and the Hamas made rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power in full development, in the past the Muslim ally the closest to Israel, took made and talks for the Hamas; just as the Qatar, one of richest and the most dynamic states of Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The members of the Hamas rejoice and say that the Islamic crescent bends down around Israel, since Lebanon, in the north, where the militia of Hezbollah exercises its domination, by way of Syria, where the rebels with Islamic tendency can overturn Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the allies of the Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And the most important, on the south side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in √âgypte, from a distance most populated and the most central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, it despot that governed √âgypte during 30 years up to its fall in 2011, had not enough time to be dedicated to the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of the Hamas, and their leaders recover from it more easily in public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, the Hamas can appear as important actor who will not be able to be even excluded any more by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw inverse conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, the Hamas was delayed on box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The system of interception of missiles called Iron Dome proved the effectiveness and many missiles of the Hamas were destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis are going to be able to sleep soundly - during some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unfaltering support; and many European countries reproached the Hamas for being at the origin of the last wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But especially, Israel throve, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who was completely unaware of the process of peace. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the shooting of rockets of Gaza kills about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was spared by assassination attempts suicides, notably thanks to the barrier of separation which encroaches on the West Bank of Jordan, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish colonies which continue stretching in spite of their illegality in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more warmonger party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman near the election of January 22nd, has the nice part. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why to pamper these Palestinian shawls by giving them a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they ran the West Bank of Jordan, would not they throw rockets, as their compatriots did make it in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and to hit them as soon as they take out the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps that the supporters of the hard line will take it; but it is possible that the Arab spring changes deal. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the islamists who take power in √âgypte and elsewhere appreciate Israel not much, their priority will be to attack problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of his four united Arab neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> To begin a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to dispose their savings. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire what is favourable - and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think of future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the Arab rest of the world which becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg which is dedicated to blow up one day in territories occupied by Israel - a bit as bus which blew up in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Suppression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population augments. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza both or three years to sound the Hamas will have a price on diplomatic plan. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need to be pushed by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Answer remains that advocated by the reasonable persons who are found on each side, and by most external world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and short-term, is that ceasefire will give occasion to the external persons to defend this reason. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> √âgypte, who must get down now to put an end to the circulation of weapon towards Gaza, in the same capacity as Turkey and the Qatar, is better put than ever to persuade the Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with borders of 1967 with exchanges of ground and shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs of the external countries should also lobby on the Hamas and Fatah so that they unite. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the UNO. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr Obama also very has interest that Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In the course of his first term, he did not introduce his own plan of peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back in the White House, it seems also reticent to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a very cramped vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital stake for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> It passes by a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Laws for packets of neutral cigarettes came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and photos of ill organs recuperate the green packets dark which are any identity, whatever is mark </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This law come into force in Australia is a world premiere, logos and colours were replaced with one olive green dark and of horrible photos of ill organs and of the representations of children and of babies whose diseases were caused by the tobacco addiction of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Except the different photos and the health warnings, the only difference between packets, since this Saturday, is the name of mark, printed in small print on all packets. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is about the most strict regime in the world in packing of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government declared that objective was to dissuade the young people from smoking by abolishing any glamorous representation. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies showed that if the persons did not begin smoking before the age of 26 years, there is 99 % of chances which they never begin. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, the children understand the message transported by the producers of tobacco through their brand image&quot;, declared the federal minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, by naming studies which revealed for example that the children linked the crown of a logo to a princess.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Even if Australia records the weakest rate of tobacco addiction in the world and if these changes have only not enough impact on the benefits of the multinational, other countries envisage a similar step. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The industry of the tobacco lobbied against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The producers of tobacco declared that it would restart the trade of the black market, which will give more easily access to less expensive cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;Harmful consequences will follow from this legislation&quot;, declared SCOTT MCINTYRE, from British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The forgers of China and of Indonesia will sell much more cigarettes of counterfeiting on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others declared that this law had made their activity more dynamic. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Hectare of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a family small enterprise, declared that the request of cases with cigarettes, notably in silicone to conceal the horrible packing, strongly augmented two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain&apos; s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco questioned law and lost in front of the High Court of Justice of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Hectare declared that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and waits for renewal of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only trouble, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and edge of directed population by plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws forbidding advertising to TV, sports sponsorship and obligation for the stockists to hide cigarettes, the marketing of the tobacco is currently available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia forbade advertising on the Web by firms and local sites, but she cannot prevent the foreign sites from making it. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the marketing of the tobacco and which you dispose only of a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the inevitable place par excellence&quot;, declared Becky Freeman, a seeker in public health to the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman pointed out an increase of the contributions of some average citizens in favour of marks on social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must wonder if it is about a simple citizen who loves cigarettes Marlboro and who took the trouble to make a video, or if it is about a marketing countryside orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia declared that industry concentrates on new regulations in force rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Industry went to the point of paying Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic to question these new decisions of justice - these countries declared to the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has important trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A decision of OMC should be made in the course of the year on 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek declared that the government had held debates with other countries concerning similar laws on packing. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make compulsory the photos of warning on packing in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Currently, these warnings are present in 40 countries, among which Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More strict laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, Southern Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensible to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Photos do not disturb me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I am unaware of it. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you line up the packet&quot;, declared Victor El Hage at the time of buying a packet on which appears a photo of tumour of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason which will make me stop, it is my small daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the centre of Sydney, declared that the uniformity of packing made difficult the tidying up of packets on shop windows. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I needed one hour to unload a package, supporting, I need four hours&quot; Yu declared. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had only to forbid them once and for all and we would have ok said, it is good, they stop and the key under the door is put&quot;, he added, by throwing up hands. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In the always linked world, it can be good to get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I passed five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> As a result, I had enough time to think about the topic of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> To pass half a day in an airport to wait for a flight is rather annoying, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the boutiques of duty-free). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more, some academics and experts specialised in the development of the child sing the praises of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, or even to feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, mostly, always in front of several types of screens, we know no more beneficial effects of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Then should we receive trouble with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back there. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, following the example of many persons, I thought that trouble was a rather recent phenomenon, notably since we have more leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But it is not case, declares Peter Toohey, teacher of graeco-roman history to the University of Calgary, to Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: In Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, on 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Trouble goes back up in very far&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pomp√©i they represent Latin graffitis which recall trouble, go back up to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then, there is the definition which we give to trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Problem is that it was defined, and discussed, in various ways, declared John D. Eastwood, professor aggregated by psychology in York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having gone through many publications and subjected idea to a group of debate about 100 persons, the professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined trouble as being an experience which consists &quot;in wanting to do something, but without managing to launch into a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the trouble of apathy, he says, it is because the person is not undertaking a task although she would wish him. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, he does not feel like there doing something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is in the middle of trouble, he declared, it is &quot;the break of the process of attention, linked to a moody mood and a feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Trouble can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But the professor Eastwood declared that if two can be linked, the persons who get bored have tendency to think that problem comes from environment or from world, while the depressed persons think that problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we sometimes think that we get bored while it is in fact about a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> As part of their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, which was published in the newspaper &quot;Perspectives one Psychological Science&quot; in September, the professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted a more ancient experience in which the participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine section. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard, from the room with side, the too high sound of a programme of TV which had no report, others hardly heard the programme of TV, and the third group heard the soundtrack in no way. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard the TV at a weak sound level said that they had more got bored than two other groups - they found it difficult to concentrate, but did not know why, and allocated this problem of concentration in trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate on a difficult or absorbing task, a break of attention can drive to trouble, declared Mark J. Fenske, a professor aggregated by neuroscience in University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you perform an annoying task, &quot;as to look at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, currently, we know that when they wriggle or what is scrawled, these gestures, often considered to be signs of trouble, are in fact a good means to remain physically sprightlier. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies showed that the children who are authorised to fidget teach more and keep more information than those who are forced to stay without moving&quot;, declared the professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all get bored some day - the delay of my flight of plane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly annoying film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some persons are more likely to get bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure it, researchers developed a &quot;Ladder of predisposition in trouble&quot; in the eighties. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The ladder includes affirmations as, &quot;Among the tasks which I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous&quot;, and &quot;I have so many centres of interest that I have no time to make everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> By using such ladder, the researchers discovered that the boys have tendency to get bored more often than the girls, declared Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology in University of West Florida, and many and various stimulations notably need. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, the teenagers are quickly blas√©. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and Community development in University of Illinois, led an experience in the course of which he contacted about 400 teenagers and their parents seven-eight times a day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noticed that 32 for hundred teenagers declared to get bored to the school and during the duties at home, while 23 for one hundred declared to get bored when they were not at the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 for hundred parents declared to get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> The professor Larson declared that he did not know if the percentages of today&apos;s trouble, that is 21 years later, would be higher or more lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is one period when trouble attains its highest level&quot;, notably because the children and the teenagers do not have a lot of control of what they want to make. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I ask again my question: is the trouble good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can make the persons to take absurd physical risks, to make bets or to fool some substances to spend the time, as studies show it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers recall a link between trouble and creativity, declared the professor Vodanovich, who studies problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Trouble is the means which the brain found to inform you that you should make something else&quot;, declared Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology in N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to be made. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you get bored and that you use this energy to play the guitar and to cook, it will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Then if your child gets bored and that you give him an iPad, he will not get bored any more, but he will have learnt to take care all alone nor in if autor√©gler, declares the professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;these autoregulations pass from a situation to other one&quot;, he declares. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to amuse himself, he gets more workmanship of himself in other domains. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we should glorify trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think either that we should criticise him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable except the constant boiling which generate activities and technology is the objective towards which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to bore us more often, but trouble awakens a sharp and frenetic desire to be linked to something with sense&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people search, it is a means to disconnect and to appreciate the time of stopping. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are always hyperstimul√©s&quot;, he added, &quot;it is difficult to find means to launch into something when noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In the Colorado, no directive for new law on the marihuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying in an university and player of football in the Colorado, is indicted with something that will become soon lawful in its state: the possession of pellets of marihuana and of a pipe used to smoke them. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr Orozco declared that once in September, shone and some friends were on board of a car in Lamar, in the middle of fields, near border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the policeman found the marihuana in the car, Mr Orozco received a quotation to appear for possession of drug and equipment that can serve in his consumption - offences under 18, each accompanied by a 100 $ fine - and a date of appearance. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated as criminals&quot;, declared Mr Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is he one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty which followed the vote of the Colorado to legalise the consumption of small quantities of marihuana for its personal usage, the answer brought to hundreds of business implicating a weak usage of drugs depends more on place than on law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences implicating the usage of marihuana were disconnectedly classified. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The services of police ceased indicting 21-year-old adults and more with possession minor of marihuana, because law will come into force in weeks to come. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts of the Colorado called to speed up the existent business of marihuana and continue indicting the persons who have it. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities of the suburbs of Denver up to the Western mountains vote currently for preventing the opening of trade of sale of marihuana agreed by the State in their districts. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things evolve so fast as I do not know what reserves us the future&quot;, declared Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The organisms of regulation of the State of Washington ask also quite a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are in search of directives on way to instal a system of licence, authorising to produce, to fabricate, to distribute and to sell - before the deadline of December 1st, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that the Colorado, that it is wanted or not, is early on most states in regulation on the marihuana, first of all concerning usage for therapeutic aims and supporting as regards personal usage. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;The Colorado has a more regulated market, and constitutes a good indicator&quot;, declared Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But neither any place nor system, admits Mr Smith, can make more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is not real precedent on which we could be based, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, what leaves a lacuna in the law of one year, during that the system of licence will not still exist, while the possession of marihuana will be lawful. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees an access adapted to the recognised marihuana and forbidden the installation of trade of sale of cannabis within 30 km around a school, around a park, around a playground or ground of a day nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will not be places more difficult than the urban zones to instal a recognised trade of sale of cannabis, notably in the metropolitan area of Seattle&quot;, declared Well Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre of legalisation of the cannabis, a research group recently was formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21st, the police chief, Oates, to Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that &quot; City attorney&quot; (representative of the public prosecutor&apos;s office) would not follow the 21-year-old persons anymore and the more who have small quantities of marihuana, and which the police had to stop indicting with persons with this type of offence &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The leader Oates declared that the police would apply new decisions of justice which regulate the activity of those who cultivate the marihuana for medical aims, and which he would continue following the drugs dealers and the pushers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in the north of the Colorado, the &quot;region attorney&quot; (prosecutor de la R√©publique), Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After vote, he declared that his office would continue taking care of business of possession of marihuana, mainly to lobby on the users so that they are detoxified. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 persons are indicted with 56-gramme possession or less marihuana, but many of them make the object of other charge. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to take proceedings against these persons who made an offence which, at the time of facts, was an admitted offence&quot;, declared Mr Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reactions were even complicated in rural places as Mesa County, where the voters rejected initiative in favour of the consumption restrained by marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the biggest city of the county, does not make appear adults any more for possession of restrained quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the public prosecutor&apos;s office of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to close disconnectedly all business of detention of marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not feel wasting my time for continuing applying law until it changes&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 pourcent of voters of the Colorado support measure, to give a legal and governmental framework adapted to the personal consumption of marihuana is not easy thing. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions which were noticed in different American cities highlight deep ambivalence among the local officials as regards the legalisation of the marihuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is about a cultural barrier&quot; with the representatives of the public prosecutor&apos;s office, declared SEAN MCALLISTER, a lawyer of Denver who represents the persons accused of consumption of marihuana and who expresses himself as local spokesperson of &quot;National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana Laws&quot; (national Organisation for the reform of laws on the marihuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They passed a lot of their life to sue persons who used some marihuana, also, they find it difficult to accept that it is lawful&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As first states to treat the consumption restrained by marihuana to the same level as that some alcohol, the Colorado and the state of Washington are on the way to becoming a case of case law for the legalisation of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While the defenders and representatives of the State envisage a new border of legalised sales, they wait with concern for directives of the federal government, which always conceives sale and culture of marihuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The defenders of the legalisation of the marihuana hope that the Ministry of Justice c√®dera. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> In spite of some arrests mediatized by patients under therapeutic marihuana and by sellers, the federal government especially allowed trade of sale of marihuana for therapeutic aims to practise in the Colorado, in Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police is not going probably to plant doors to grab small sachets of drugs, there is extremely to bet that it opposes to recognised trade of sale of marihuana with personal usage allowed by new laws, declared Kevin A. Sabet, an ancient political adviser of the administration Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities of the Colorado do not have given that the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Long before polls, some local administrations approved moratoriums concerning the creation of new trade of sale of marihuana, even if it is only about an adjournment of one year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the city of Montrose got a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to meet in a situation where a licence is granted to somebody and then to find us confronted with a federal problem&quot;, declared Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> A lot of questions settle. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was manhandled and excluded from Oxford, because I was one &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not only the today&apos;s students who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> However far I remember, I always dreamt to enter the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my elder brother studied in what was for me a distinguished place of knowledge, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of the modern time which stimulates both pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks being installed in me in Worcester College at the end of the eighties to study history, I decided to pack my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were disconcerted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of Evening Standard pretended that I had left this university, because I had objected the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A.  N. Wilson declared with practical joke that I had left having been forced to drink in chipped cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less odd. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I ran away, because I had been victim of threats and made the object of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather extreme, nor because of fact than I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for the one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, one was recommended very influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was partisan of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why to recall it today, you will say to me. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> And good, recent studies revealed that a right new generation of students of centre suffers the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The hate increasing and institutionalised by the students Tory in Oxford is such as last week, some of them demanded a protection of their rights, in the same capacity as those of the gays, handicapped persons and of ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The conservative members of the room of the students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College declared that they &quot;were often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable&quot; because of their political opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university as the equality of chances so that their opinions could be freely expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not made easier by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC TWO &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and one the Right&quot; (&quot;The land of enchantment: Young, clever and of Right&quot;), dedicated to politics at the students, and which represented the &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentric and neonazi. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> They notably discovered there the student Joe Cooke, former president of &quot; Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) &quot;, who moves in Rolls-Royce, sports a silver-plated suit and with a cane at chromium-plated head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, the conservative students tell they are treated as scapegoats of the installation of the increase of school fees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of &quot;Nottingham University Conservative Association&quot;, declared in a Sunday newspaper &quot;that there is a party taken by left growing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think that we are as Bullingdon Club without having met us even.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Robert, 21 years old, studying in history in the Corpus Christi, who offered a motion for more protection, says that such climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, says that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR regarding the persons who are of centre right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;It constitutes a hindrance in the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as in the ease of the members&quot;, she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think suchlike in the course of my first weeks passed in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered in September, 1986, I was then 18-year-old and of a paralyzing bashfulness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hate of the conservative party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted for refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher - an ancient student - a honorary title, because of the reduction of the financing of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week of reception, when the new students made acquaintance with others and the professors, I had a foretaste of what is later going to take place. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors not only participated in sarcasms towards the students Tory, but that on top of that, they enjoyed there. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as though the politics about the miners strikers, of privatisation and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in Southern Africa was engraved in the wood of schoolrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm victim of which was I concerned a translation towards English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt&quot;, said the professor Harry Pitt (now died), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost ground. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man with the face pustuleux, lost temper easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatch√©ristes does refuse to learn French or are they just stupid? &quot;he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears burnt me eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you taking classes of French during your leisure - finally, if you are not too much occupied to make friends&quot;, he threw of an argumentative tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I went back to my room, desolate. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> During dinner this evening there, I sat down only then I smelt a light knock my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in second year of studies of English, named James, that came as member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are&quot;, he said, mildly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that he is there so. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Every person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is puck on. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is already rather hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, this will therefore be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of young Tory pretend to be of Ploughing (Labour supporters). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in the local pub, I tried in a cowardly way to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I stressed the fact that I did not agree with all what had said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This stratagem failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences which, ironically, had studied in Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pork.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took back refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was corrupted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do the Tories make love? &quot;one of them asked. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They get worked up, really?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt as the homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have only could lead a normal life to Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet persons sharing the same points of view only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Ploughing and to disavow my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Coming three years are going to resemble a purgatory of ostracism and of isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, modern teacher of history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only detested because he was conservative, but also because he was to recommend in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He detested this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its membership from the point of view Marxist-determinist of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted professor&apos;s post to the university of Bilkent, in Ankara, in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here&quot;, he said to me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began making the shuttle between Oxford and the home of my parents in London, finding shelter to my family and my city friends more opened by mind. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I said to my father that I detested Oxford and I explained him why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in Oxford, in the forties, all political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world&quot;, he said to me pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would make this, not in the city in the dreamy bell towers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends had in a blameless way. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears with eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Leave them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is to tease you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> It would break me the heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Made tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance progressively deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and abandoned his conviction. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> In the course of a session of jobs run next week, when another teacher of history suggested the world most seriously, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to make it so much. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Going red internally with shame, I allowed to be victim of the washing of brain of my parents and treated them as &quot; old madmen &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Respite was short-term. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father who planted the last nail of my oxfordien coffin. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch&apos;s press every week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I remained hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed my suitcase and I took the first train for London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I have never gone back to it. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me as whining milksop. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-old child should be victim of such threat in a school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The most tragic is that it was about Oxford, which not only produced first 14 ministers Tory, but also benefits from unshakeable one reputation of equality and of freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance to notability&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of exhibition &quot;Valentino: a master de la Couture&quot;, inaugurated this week in London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian couturier. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the ancient residence of √âlisabeth Ire d&apos; Angleterre, is the only place of British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The couturier admitted him during unveiling of &quot;Valentino: a master de la Couture&quot;, retrospective one prestigious which unites more than 130 models of haute couture created for the home of sewing in the course of 50 last years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this palace&quot;, he declared with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the point of organ of a history the only protagonist of which is &quot;he signore&quot; Garavani, but that would not have been able to be written without his famous customers. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino was always fascinated by the closed world and apart of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3rd of this year, they find an impressive number of private letters and of photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan until lord Snowdon, by way of the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret d&apos; Angleterre. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino displays his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: of the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, in the idol of jet-set international. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong to like kingship. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least, they do not crush their stubs of cigarettes on your splendid carpet as some stars of music pop make it&quot;, declares the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the sixties and 70, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular guest and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all loved to be invited in his chalet of Gstaad&quot;, explains the former spouse of &quot; Heini &quot; Thyssen, the intimate friend of beauties of passed time as Marella Agnelli or Eug√©nie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino always preferred elegance to notability. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And even so, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, carrying a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Model Argentinian, Valeria Mazza, either did not forget the charisma of the couturier. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to have dinner in its flat. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were persons&apos; about twenty, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Its mind in every detail of its flat, in decoration, food, music were seen and they felt. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, every guest felt important and appreciated&quot;, reminds &quot; model beep &quot;, which began working Sewing with him during the week of the High - in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot; He will never die a natural death, because his creations are works of art&quot;, she ends. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of descendants of nobility </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but shared love affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves very high people and with the biggest titles and them also love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres broad which offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must march on the catwalk to admire a &quot;public&quot; of dream wearing main creations of Valentino, as suit which had chosen Jackie Kennedy as his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costume which wore Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a woollen topcoat and fur having belonged to the empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among this public of models, names as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario de Bulgarie or Sophie de Habsbourg are found. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many his customers say that the first clothes Valentino are as the first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was about trousers, about shirt, about waistcoat &quot; gillette &quot; and about jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a present which he had given me&quot;, declared Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the couturier. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer it to all the others for its womanhood, its best love of the women, and because it sublimates our beauty&quot;, adds the ex-duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love very much the colours which he uses, they are luminous and light the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and the modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos; Arenberg can, her either, forget the first time that it carried a model Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was youthful and lived in Italy, she dreamt to be the age old and the occasion to wear one of the formal dresses... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible at the end of the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a holiday in the castle of my cousin, the prince Edward de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red formal dress, with a skirt with steering wheels, a draped brassiere and a neckline to be thrown. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream brung into being&quot;, declared the widow of Rodrigue d&apos; Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is uninterested to fashion, he is haunted by the timeless&quot;, explains the Italian aristocrat who shares her life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The princess of Arenberg keeps the formal dresses of the couturier with &quot;the biggest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is as all memories as she transports&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Le &quot;roi&quot; de la mode </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The big final of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller carried during the marriage with Paul de Gr√®ce in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> 25 &quot;Ragazze&quot; was needed four working months and (the couturier calls his dressmakers so) to accomplish this silk dress ivory with inlaying of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a four and a half-metre train. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialised press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the end of the XXth century, &quot;the return of the customers of the high society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed during years by the &quot;knowledge-being&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Horsewoman di Gran Croce (the biggest differentiation in Italy), horsewoman del Lavoro, Commander in the order of Arts and of Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani combines so much honours as any spouse of her customers. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;His refinement, his peace, his well-manicured and perfect aspect were always blindingly obvious to me&quot;, admits of Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Last time when I saw him, it was one month ago in a dinner of gala in the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my big friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;He was flawless, years have no effect on him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess who says it... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job of the world: the human female mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euro, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health by carrying 70 kilogrammes of sulphur across the abrupt stony tracks. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom job is a Hell and others who work literally in Hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the Indonesian island of Popular dance. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He must work every day up to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from bowels of the earth solidifies in the contact of air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having harvested big rocks of sulphur, which weigh in total about 70 kilogrammes, he instal them in two baskets in bamboo which he loads on his shoulders across the abrupt tracks. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres up to the peak of the volcano which culminates as in altitude as 2,386 metres, but the exhausted bearers put more than 40 minutes to climb up this distance, in turtle&apos;s pace, by keeping balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall in precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a mistake could cost them life, as it arrived at a French tourist who made a lethal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for every kilogramme of extracted sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once above, him elbow in between the tourists who photograph them as though they were animals of circus, and carrying barely the heavy baskets, they walk 3 kilometres up to the balance that a mining society installed a bit down below in 1,850 metres in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about PT CANDI NGRIMBI, a firm which exploits the volcano since 1960 and, it is possible to say it, her employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) by kilogramme of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> She sells it then in 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) in petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and used to fabricate candles, fireworks, beauty products, dynamite and serves even for whitening the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we transport about 70 kilogrammes, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euro) in every trip&quot;, explains us Anto, who performs three trips in general a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Each gets from him 3 hours and he ends exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11,50 euro) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it appears to be a misery for such superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would earn in fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of the miners is very high here, where the harvest of the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro) a day and when the monthly average wage is two million rupees (167 euro)&quot;, declares the bearer who worked in the past as bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, the wage was 75,000 rupees (6,20 euro) a day and the work was not also difficult, but Anto came back near the family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is also unquestionable as the sulphur: &quot;I married a girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Popular dance so that she becomes a convert to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, always coughs and the eyes are irritated by toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At the age of 27, he passed three of his life to outbrave danger on Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun making him pay the bill although it covers the face with a mask and a door of special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, always coughs and the eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price which he must pay to follow his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work another two years, because I want to open a boutique or to study Spanish or French&quot; he promises in English more than allowable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Manhandled by life, this nice and clever young person could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of it, he does the job of a female mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a hovel of insalubrious wood with other bearers, gets up every day at two o&apos;clock because the sulphur does not cease flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow colour becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Outbraving the darkness, Anto goes down in the crater by becoming clearer with a small lamp fixed to the helmet, which he bought himself with the own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 bearers load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders since the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> In spite of its comfortable benefits, the mining company did not mechanise the extraction of the sulphur to economise costs and gives no equipment to the bearers who work on their count and are paid to weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Besides, they do not touch one either under 30,000 rupees (2,50 euro) of increase by camera, besides the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro), which the guards of this nature park invoice to the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his human female mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This job is done for the animals, not for the human beings&quot;, Madrusin, a chunky bearer of 42 years protests who works in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of hitting up to 110 kilogrammes, he assures that he will not give up working &quot;as long as he will be able him&quot;, because he needs money to bring up his 3 sons, between 10 and 18 year old. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur harms the throat and irritates eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke which go out of the volcano, they are so hardened as nobody complains to suffer from serious illnesses to which are added of course their habitual respiratory problems, osteoarthrites, pain in knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> By balancing the basket on the back, Unainik, 53-year-old, is only possible load 50 kilogrammes. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, his companions and extract him 15 tons of sulphur of the volcano, which three lorries transport in the warehouse of Tamansari, in 18 kilometres from there by a track of goats pervaded by the bad grasses. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life&quot;, asserts Unainik by opening well the mouth, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The elder of his five children, 30-year-old, also works as bearer of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but misery perpetuates of generation in generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one that make the human female mules of the volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore searches babies to save economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singaporean throw the responsibility of this absence of children on career, stress and cost of the access to property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore must develop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us carry out our civic duty and let us give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It can seem improbable that these words come from an advertising for pastilles to the mint, but nevertheless, or perhaps thanks to it, video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Words come from a group of rap which uses local references as &quot;Let&apos;s go to put a Punch in the drawer&quot; to make fun of the birthrate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of video, hopes to draw attention to problem in an amusing way thanks to this advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative manager, Douglas Hamilton, declared that he wanted to use the power of music so that people carry out &quot; their national duty &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> She is only intended for the Internet, we could therefore make her amusing and amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is about main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the field of birthrate, so we had a feeling that it was a topic which we had to approach. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had attracted several things as throwing of perfumes in ph√©romones or to organise parties of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> A lot of these ideas were creative but they willy-nilly did not work. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We therefore claimed to be the following thing: what of more creative to resolve this problem than to make a song of rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore does not get it so much from the light. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends 1,300 dollars US a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and of the fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars by child, lengthens maternity leaves and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all that had not enough effects. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city - rich state and of high-tech southeast of the Asia, so known for the conservatism of its leaders and his strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birthrate of Singapore, in accordance with its national sharing out of population, is currently to 1,2 children by woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Last time when it was above 2, considered itself to be the rate of renewal, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why therefore do not the Singaporean have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, head of the politics of marriage and of family of the National Division of the Population, maintains that it is due to a &quot;better education&quot; and in &quot;a broader choice of opportunities of career&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It allowed to people to have a broader range of options in terms of objectives of life and of priorities, beyond marriage and beyond constitution of a family&quot;, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms contributed to increase among single men and to postpone marriage and births, what has as result a reduction of birthrate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meantime, a politics of immigration aiming at augmenting immigration radically to counter the reduction of the population created a resentment within the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, they find that Websites which abounds a xenophobia barely dressed up contrary to the new immigrants, especially towards Chinese who are accused of drawing wages downwards and of not integrating. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase of immigration is also perceptible as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore knew last year its worst electoral results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since elections, they tried to correct problem with the installation of quotas and higher taxes for the foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unhoped consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall of birthrate has effects known on economic growth of a country, tax incomes, health costs and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries to avoid the building of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it began touching the property sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development began controlling the number of small flats, known as &quot;shoe box&quot;, able to be constructed in determined zones of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These flats have a 46-square metre area and their sale wins a lot of success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, authorities are preoccupied due to the fact that they could promote a lifestyle of single man and discourage the promoters wanting to build big family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the property society EL DEVELOPERS, maintains that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are much more quickly sold than the bigger accommodation. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in sense where this accommodation are more fast built than those of bigger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is more profitable for our treasury. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he supposes that new norms give more clear instructions to the promoters, to whom they before put a spoke in the wheel if they wanted to offer too many small accommodation in a plan. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city - State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> So as long is that these new regulations could be a step towards the increase of national birthrate, by discussing with the Singaporean who work in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they do not go to have a lot of effects. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very put on edge, houses are expensive, just as education, it is for it that people delays him in later&quot;, declares a young frame. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other persons can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time&quot;, declares us another young person of about twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The men and the women mention their career, stress and the cost of the access to property and education as reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, although the government tries to persuade its citizens to have children, when it is a question of making babies, it is the Singaporean themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private exceptional is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> In accordance with the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it involves about the quality of private domain or &quot;the private domain of life which we are possible protect from any intrusion&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What est-ce-qui releases from the domain deprived for least than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in daily life and to social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Does he include danger of which he runs the risk by diffusing on Internet of events which he would not indeed share exceptional? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The elPeri√≥dico newspaper questioned five young boys, between 10 and 15 year old, user frequent of the cloth. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of cases, they linked term &quot;something very personal&quot; in personnel terms and &quot;the password and user&apos;s name&quot; when they applied it to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post&quot;, asserts Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the signification of the term deprived on sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a count for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everybody&quot;, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On BFRS, I post nice pictures or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discuss with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I will not share one of my photos or of somebody who would make the fool&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The young boy reconnait that it is wrong to publish indecent photos, bare persons, crimes or to write mortifying or violent comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on BFRS as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the count. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened an account Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I do not know if they answer me, I post them simply&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are amusing, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, in a quick way&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He maintains that he would never accept the request of an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He will not either trust in anybody who would recommend him a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jos√©, 14 years old, differs. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has count on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, he allows not to know 20 of the persons registered on his friends&apos; list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It does not worry me because we have something together, music for example&quot;, he declares. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the young boy, person paid him advances neither nor asked him for her address or for her telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they put pressure in me or demanded it, I would abolish them simply of my count&quot;, he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jos√© subscribed in Ask having read a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiments which are known under the name of cyberharassment today are not foreign to the young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> One extorted money on a social network from a close of one of my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened it and demanded some money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He has never known who it was&quot; he assures. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jos√©, did not close her count. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He only passed him in private profile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> He explains us then a series of manipulations for configurer his count dependably. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would make it if I was made angry or irritated. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even if I know that it is cyberharassment&quot;, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Questions keys </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, professor of English and laid off in Education and Training, considers that, to orientate the children and the teenagers, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has rule of the game come into sight as a means to search information but, with the appearance of these sites, changed&quot;, she mentions. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras signals that the academician Mark Prensky, who has a master in pedagogy of the university of Yale and author of the book &quot;Natives and numerical immigrants&quot;, uses these terms to explain phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The numerical natives, they are them, the children and the young people who were born with technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;Us, we are the numerical immigrants who must teach them there, while we are ourselves teaching&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He tops up that topic is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what it is necessary or not to disclose, to publish or to say in an age when they have no necessary maturity to make it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We also ask them to be selective while what matters them most is to be popular, of credit of the thousands of friends without thinking of consequences&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most efficient way to teach confidentiality the children and the teenagers is to use questions which make them reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them not to make it is of no use&quot;, she asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists some examples: there are things which you would not tell a foreigner, why do you make him on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Where, would it please you that they publish a photo of you how that of a friend that you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identify photos of holidays, do you ask other persons for permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, does everybody need to know what you make every other minute? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make understand to them that they have to act online as they make it exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, each must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be similar on social networks&quot;, she asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and adviser of education, declares that it is necessary that the parents read conscientiously the conditions of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By including each of terms, they will have solid bases to discuss Internet with their children of the involvements of the opening of a count. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or to publish&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind the children that you should not speak to the foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of Unasur ended without the Statement of Lima becoming public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The VIth presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (Unasur) has ended today in Peru without the Statement of Lima becoming public, although it is announced before and theoretically adopted by 7 present deputies. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe tried again and again to achieve the document signed during the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the leaders of States and of government of Unasur, but the ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidency signalled at first that it would be disclosed after the fence of the summit, then maintained that it would be published from instant to the other one on the Internet site of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were questioned about the text, they signalled that its contents had been displayed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, during short statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of the journalists to information concerning the summit was always limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;audio, private session restrained&quot; was broadcast in the press-room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Not enough information which circulated between the journalists those was given by the press attach√©s of some of the governments of Unasur which attended appointment, except for the Peruvian spokesperson. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of the present presidents, what caused some feeling of faintness to the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media which claimed more important information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru sent an email in media with the &quot;final statement&quot; of the summit, but it was about the speech of the president Humala and not of the official document which concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was the guest of the 3rd summit America of the South-country Arab (ASPA) and, at this occasion, good that the press asks for it insistently, it had not broadcast either the statement called also Statement of Lima, as it had before been announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official site of the ASPA, it is possible to prove that the document was published in last March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up sure systems of transmission for all journalists, but they limited at the farthest the getting of information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also ended with the joint agreement of Chile and of Peru to accept a judgement of the Court of The Hague which cuts a different person living near the border between both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during regional appointment and declared that they would respect the decision of CIJ to hear the advocacies of both parts in the trial which Lima began against Santiago and that begins on Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and carry out the verdict which will solve disagreement which we carry in front of this International Court today&quot;, declared the president Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was always, and will continue being a respectful country of international law, of peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and of international courts&quot;, added the president Pi√±era by giving a handshake to the president Humala, next to the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit in CIJ took place after Colombia reports this week the Pact of Bogota by which she had agreed to submit to decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which she considered as gravely erroneous. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, hanging of Unasur since 2011 after the discharge of its ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The president guest, Ollanta Humala, was made responsible for opening deliberation in the morning and for closing the summit shortly after midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The deputy read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 plans had been fixed between the South American countries for a 17 million dollar total of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among adopted agreements, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set up &quot;important steps to hit the mark of South American citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that actions would be set up to improve &quot;cooperation in the struggle against urban insecurity and against international organised crime, actions for a better accessibility in medicaments, access to the Internet cheap in its entirety of South America, and to assess in a joint and efficient way risks of natural disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, &quot;economic strengthening (from Latin America) does not owe to have a triumphalist matrix but must help to augment our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our populations&quot;, concluded the president Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic plans which improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in the rural and border zones by joining our countries and by generating new economic circuits&quot;, declared the Peruvian president during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these plans, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axles of its territory, since the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with the Ecuador although he does not give the most ample details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the election process of this country will allow its return within the Union of the South American Nations&quot;, from whom he is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Necessity that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and of peace, included and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic approached during the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this direction, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, declared, before beginning regional appointment, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico City to discuss maritime disagreement calmly through a judgement of CIJ asked by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (on Saturday), I have a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega&quot;, declared the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which is going to ask to have a debate with this country&quot;, he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope I can say to the president Ortega that we are going to regulate it in a most civilised and respectful possible way&quot;, added the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they planned to attend the seizure of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> In the same way, as part of the summit, Defence Ministers of the block will meet beforehand to approve the Plan of action of year 2013, which tries to reinforce dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although this last country is hanging. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru assures the presidency pro tempore of the regional block. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must teach of Europe how include a citizenship&quot;, declares Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of the Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has maintained today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which &quot;South America, in that case, had to take as model on Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The president Correa, who participated in the VIth summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, declared on State television, TV P√âRU, that the Europeans &quot;support entretu√©s during World War II&quot; and during other conflicts, &quot;but that they formed now practically a fatherland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this direction, it defended plan to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by countries members of Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to reach the free mouvement of the citizens and of the workers in any South American country, as it is already case for the members of the Community Andine, but there still remain reactionary domains that we want to make belong to past&quot; he informed. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Besides, the Ecuadoran president showed himself in favour of the reconstitution of the Organisation of the American States (OEA) with objective to diminish the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account the signatories of the pact of San Jos√© on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who reshuffle us ears never compromise themselves anything, in the opposite, us, the South American, all signed it. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the InterAmerican Committee of human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States&quot;, he asserted, by alluding to the political asylum granted by the Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assures that he does not regret the decision, because he not betrayed the principles himself, but he respected on the contrary the &quot;deep democratic values and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that at that time &quot;there was founded suspicion according to who Assange would be extradited to a third country and that its trial would not be respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Besides, it criticises the Swedish justice which demanded that he submits on his territory to a cross-examination concerning a supposed sexual offence while &quot;own Swedish legislation allows to make it by video-conference, what could be made since the embassy of the Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa maintained that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I did not speak him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious&quot;, asserted the Ecuadoran president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that its physical and mental health deteriorates by fact to be locked up in a small space without being able to make exercises outside. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It acts on the health of whoever&quot;, he concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa signals that the solution of asylum granted in Assange since June in the Ecuadoran embassy of London, which would be the attribution of a safe-conduct which would allow him to go in Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of European judicial authorities and he underlines that he had debates in London to find a solution in the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in that case, but there were permanent debates. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution in this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of European judicial authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garz√≥n, threw the whole series of procedures to different European authorities&quot;, he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thinks that &quot;if Great Britain granted the safe-conduct from tomorrow, it would end&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as allows it completely its legislation, and as it has already made it in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or her via Skype tomorrow, problem would be also resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa was of benefit there to reassert as defender of the freedom of the press and he added that what he did not tolerate was &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies which harm the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the malevolent or perverse politicians but the bad journalists in the pay of greed, of blackmail and of extortion&quot;, he declared. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Under this angle, he was very pleased that it is not this type of journalists &quot;neither the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries which prevail in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than to put its re-election forward, &quot;he would deepen revolution to follow the way and to draw the good way&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to support the v√©to on Paraguay within Unasur at least up to the next elections, by arguing that organism &quot;had to prove to be firm and not tolerate opportunism and tries disguised of coup d&apos;√©tat&quot;, because in reality, &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Furthermore the Ecuadoran president considers as &quot;perfectly pertinent&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate Nicaragua with the maritime borders between both countries by means of the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, what will reinforce maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgement is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be exceeded by the will to advance together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is necessary to solve them in their group to exceed them and to go forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he claimed to be confident in the good resolution of the litigation concerning maritime borders which compares Peru and Chile within the same court and he maintained that he is &quot;advantageous that Latin America grabs international authorities if both countries agree to accept a judgement however firm he is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of its presentation as candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to craving for a third consecutive mandate, it signalled that he saw this possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, good that it is sometimes rather difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that, if he lost the primary of February, 2013, he would leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> At personal level, power has never interested me, but in so unfair situations as those of the Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can be resolved only by means of political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement thought that it was me which guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility&quot;, he asserted. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last presidential term of office and I will leave political life then. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If ever we lose, I will also make it. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision&quot;, he asserted. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch√°vez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just discussed with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicol√°s Maduro and he said to me that a medical treatment of routine was already planned and that he waited for the end of the countryside to go back in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It does not mean a relapse of the state of health of the president Ch√°vez&quot;, he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The leader of Ecuadoran State has participated today in Lima in the VIth summit of the leaders of State and of government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) which ended by a call to a better regional integration to support progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Deceases linked to the AIDS are due to a late detection today. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of the test was confirmed it: seropositive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It&apos;s as if the sky had fallen me on the head&quot;, he says by referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make &quot;less hard&quot;, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid him from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take responsibility alone for his illness and began enquiring on his subject and his furious energy was such as he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is, unquestionably, one of the most ancient patients of the unit of the HIV of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he was in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio saw with the virus of the human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the nineties, when he doubted there, few choices of treatment and more stigmata a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the manager of a private hospital of IMSS avoided saying to him goodbye &quot;because he was speechless&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In those days, to have the AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, having &quot;exhausted &quot; their immune system and victims of opportunistic infections are. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, in any case after the first signalled cases, &quot;big victory is today that the survival of a patient having started a treatment timely and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same&quot;, pointed out the leader of the unit of the HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that the AIDS was not any more a lethal illness, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system which introduced the patients at the time of diagnosis, with better perspectives for those not using drugs: until 30 years for CD4&apos;s rate from 200 and to 50 years for those attaining a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> To speak simply, it means that for somebody who would receive a diagnosis positive HIV in 25 years, &quot;as long as he will stay under control, be able to live without problems until 75 years&quot;, explained the questioned scientist. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To replace this progress in his context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexican is today of 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that mortality diminished considerably these last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of persons died of the continuation of the AIDS passed from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of ONUSIDA), but it is also true that, since the appearance of the AIDS, 60 % patients listed on the basis of data national died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco, 255 persons died in 2011, and there was 187 dead until May of this year; however, they assure us that the access to antir√©troviraux medicaments is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Then why are there deceases still? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that problem does not come from the access to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> It is as it that I see him, it is what took place in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over 12 last years at least, we have never lacked medicaments, problem is that the patients arrive at very advanced stadiums because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stadiums of illness. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He gives us an unquestionable fact &quot;nine patients of ten arrive while they already introduce an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a bigger impact on total mortality, it is to accomplish more precocious diagnoses and, for it, it is necessary to offer tests of screening in a massive way, to all persons who ask for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> The specialists and the State members of the Council of prevention of the AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree about his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has to make his test of screening in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had made him and because, in spite of his youth, he was already bearing of the AIDS and suffered from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumour which is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some people think that they are going to die and want to know nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am going to die, it is better than I burst three times a week&quot;, they say, it is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> Change was advantageous, I eat well, I get some exercise, I take my medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> This day, his parents know only that he suffers from a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, as whoever of other one. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have a sexual life active, but coresponsible, I pay attention to me and to the other person&quot;, tells Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his evidence, those who are afraid today, during the walk of the Worldwide Day against the AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> That they make the test, if they took risks, more they will know early if they are seropositive and better it will be, and if they already have diagnosis, they have to be able to that it is possible to live as everybody, by being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Its message sums up the slogan of battle against the AIDS in this year of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the bar </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many ditches between the programmes of health and the ordinary citizen, support Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who embraced of the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest domiciles in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places devoted to it, &quot;the distribution of condoms was really augmented, before one or two, now were given us packets of one hundred are given us, it is very well, but he results from it, that today even, some do not have access to condoms&quot;, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable in the new infections, the teenagers are found. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> Question: &quot;What you are going to make?&quot;, having put down with sarcasm and judgements of value by the social workers, the advisers of direction, the chemists and the professionals of health, the question is which the teenagers do not feel like hearing, assures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He offers to reorientate this ineffectual distribution; that condoms are not only sold at bars, but that they are found in the distributors of the public toilets and in the places which visit the young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not a question pay to either them the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez when they had asked him if there would be a distribution of condoms within the administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It is not as it that works sexuality, the best is to give condoms to the already active persons sexually&quot;, he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> They take a census of 13,435 combined cases (12,158 of the AIDS and 1,317 of the HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cases combined by AIDS and 13th for the number of the sick of the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92 % pollution are made by sexual way, 6 % by blood way and 2 % by perinatal way. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> They think that 50,000 persons live with the HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 persons who are unaware of it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgement ratified in call by a court of the United States is unaware of the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro approved via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. Scenario causes a harmful precedent for all national societies having ramifications in the country neighbouring and having problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> They would say therefore that the procedures of survival of societies allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country in the star-spangled banner, in the contrepied of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow carried to judgement returned June 15th of this year by the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of bankruptcies for the north region of Texas, leaves the defenceless Mexican societies facing the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, resolution is going to allow to the main glass producer of Mexico to grab the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of three disconnectedness. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge of reason signals that the creditors have to record themselves according to law on bankruptcies of the United States, the court of call of the fifth circuit, assembling in New Orleans, maintains that main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would implicate to report the cooperation of international procedure in cases of insolvency of firms having a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Indeed, the Model law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial law had been created to this end by taking the American Law Institute as referee. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, judgement establishes that without vote intersocieties, admitted in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro towards the parent company, the majority requested for the approval of restructuring would not have been able to be got. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, Mexican laws admit this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Indeed, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There is here a half a dozen of examples, among who Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies of which had guarantees debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Besides, what is sure is because, since there remained the polls of subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say funds &quot;vulture&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have got the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> Vote would have been 45 votes against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Data skipped by the court of call. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro was criticised for the difficult situation which he has encountered since 2008 without stopping in serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, reverberating costs in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> At the moment, the society of the family Gonz√°lez Sada interjettera call before the same court of call so that vote takes place in its entirety, that is with five magistrates, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The appeal of insurance will claim non-prosperity and demands the revision of trial by the upper authority, in that case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court is unaware of a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;) in whom was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro as part of law on commercial bankruptcies, by signalling that it liberated it from conventions signed by both countries to put it at the same level that the indent 15 of law on bankruptcies of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Besides, he signals that the country submitted to the principles of the Committee of the United Nations concerning International trade, that is to say rules fixed for cases of insolvency cross-border, which guarantee equity for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile-up of two parts: they stun Vitro and they stun the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General balance sheet </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of the labour unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation contrary to the ex-boss of the society, Gast√≥n Azc√°rraga Andrade, were passed under silence during several months, this one was accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of the pilots airmen has already met problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The authority, headed by Carlos D√≠az Ch√°vez Morineau, has just introduced a criminal request against the Banking National Committee and Stocks which is accused of blockage in justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the authority of examination disclaimed systematically having gives information to the public prosecutor de la R√©publique on an operation accomplished by the businessman to withdraw Fr from the trust / 589 of the bank IXE 198 millions pesos in the name of the Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Funds would have been used for the purchase of Professional actions of the Administration of Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As everyone knows, Azc√°rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> They besiege the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> United at the end of week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national environmentalists and foreigners, professors of university, businessmen and of the members of the society approved the creation of a broad forehead of opposition to the unveiling of the Dragon Chinese Mart in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know it, we speak about a colossal centre of sale and of distribution in Mexico, in Central America and in the Caribbean of products of the country of the big wall, with a zone of house for the employees of 150 societies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Before, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and of Transformation) had succeeds in joining the governors of the southeast zone to oppose to the monumental plan which is partly on safe havens and represents the biggest of all threats influencing industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> ACTA died </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government put forward a requirement of the senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Trade agreement Anti-counterfeiting, known under his English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already of the ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As everyone knows, it was made although the senate condemns this possibility itself, because it was considered to be an infringement of civil liberties of expression on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Homex in the long term </seg>
<seg id="2862"> With the intention of paying long-term debts without affecting those in the short term, the property promoter Homex launched on the market of the Stock Market for 500 million pesos. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> H√©ctor &quot; Hetin &quot; Reyes &quot;basketball is all my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotter of basketball &quot; Hetin &quot; Reyes passed more than 60 years of his life in touch with the ground and, thanks to him, travelled worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few persons with Puerto Rico have knowledge of the local history of basketball so big as that of H√©ctor &quot; Hetin &quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Reason is there that before a cerebral haemorrhage condemns him for the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was submerged in these sports during more than 60 years, before it is as player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayam√≥n or president of the federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I carried several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and president of the federation during the nineties&quot;, reminds Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at home in Bayam√≥n, where he domiciles with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is all my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this affirmation. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of of his home, almost every persons honoured for his service of photos and of memories which remind of his route except norms, testify it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> All his memories, those of that he is most very fond are those who remind him of his passage as of player within the team of Vaqueros in the mid-fifties until 1982, having passed 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, those which I most used because I had the chance to participate in eight championships of Vaqueros from 1967, because it is as manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> It makes many years of satisfaction, including five championships were competed from 1971 till 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then left during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot; Cuco &quot; Ortiz, who was a big administrator, the team&quot; became leader, points Reyes out. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been ruling here and who was to the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot;I have a strong player as you, he measures two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It is as it that to begin Mincy, one of the best players whom has Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the better shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed to Bayamon to win a championship, Laughs is going to help us to try to win other one. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> It belongs delights the championship of Vaqueros with Laugh, but only with hindsight since in 1988 it has already been the big shot of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In those days, he preferred being of benefit of his expenses and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament of Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then, there was the world championship for 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play again the last match, declared Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Is the team of the world championship for 1990 the best national team which you see? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is part of the best, just as the one who beat Dream Team during the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favourite is that of Pan-American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we put one scraped clean to the team of the United States, which was rather similar to the one who had won the bronze during the world championship. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, Laughs, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and &quot; Picul√≠n &quot; (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) &quot; To√±ito &quot; colonist and James Carter, the brothers Le√≥n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot; Quijote &quot; Moral, who had not been able to attend the worldwide of 90 because of a problem of knees. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team which was not perhaps the best in individuals&apos; terms, but she gave us a gold medal and a big joy during the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuqu√©n in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players as &quot; Canito &quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young person Rolando Hourruitiner in return for hanging players by the mess of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Unquestionably, it is about Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His statistics at the level of international tournaments is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico prevailed at this level as made it Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And it without taking his trajectory into account in the different leagues for which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto-Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In the young people, I love very much the job which does Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your biggest success within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Have been part of the most glorious epoch of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact when at the beginning of 1990s, BSN counted up to 17 teams in season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you have to make? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things which I would like to set up, as the regionalisation of categories minor. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example that the boys of Pounce play only in their zone and confront only teams of other corners of the island during the national play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the young people travel and play too much while it is not willy-nilly necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I saw at least the advantage of the compulsory certifications and of courts for the leaders, the personnel of ground and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you make today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look at pop videos of my epoch on YouTube, I use my grandsons and, from time to time, I attend matches of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I use the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always in my sides. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born September 21st, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became famous all over the world by the title role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in television series &quot;Paved&quot;, in whom he represented a businessman without scruples, formidable and manipulative. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, of whom magnate&apos;s role of the oil without scruple J.R. Ewing in television series &quot;Paved&quot; a symbol of avarice in 1980s became, died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of &quot;Dallas &quot;, died on Friday evening of complications of a cancer, according to a press release of the family sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., production company of &quot;Dallas &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, playing again the ironic role which he most liked&quot;, declared the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Paved in this bank holiday of Thanksgiving. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in original series and afterwards, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital of Dallas, declared his press attach√©, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, odd, tender and gifted, and I am going to lack a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was a person of exception and he lived life thoroughly&quot;, declared Gray in a press release. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted having drunk a lot during many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, a clever tumour in the liver had been discerned it and it had suffered a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years before &quot;Dallas &quot;, Hagman had become famous on television in the role of an ordinary type in series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; broadcast by the chain NBC from 1965 till 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In this one, he interpreted the role of the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an appealing genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he brought it back at home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He also played in two comedies which stayed not enough time in the aerial, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, on 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his roles in the cinema, they find roles received by criticism in &quot; The group &quot;, &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of deliciously distasteful J.R. that Larry Hagman was his biggest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of the chain CBS on the clan Ewing and their fellows was broadcast from April, 1978 till May, 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;who killed J.R.?&quot;, invented to maintain suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is practically assassinated, generated speculations worldwide and millions of dollars played in bets. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to it, between others, series attained a record of audience in this epoch. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When answer was revealed in an episode of November, 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made of &quot;Dallas &quot; the second programme of entertainment most looked in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the BELLE-S≈íUR E J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) that had pulled her over. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. had put her surrounding wall and then threatened it to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other persons also had reasons to attack her. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and a faithless spouse who tried to make commit his alcoholic Known wife Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what would be needed as epitaph for J.R&quot;, declared Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> They should write: &quot;Ci-g√Æt honest CITIZEN J.R. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here is the only part which he lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagonist original series, remembered on Friday of Hagman as of a huge &quot;man, both on the small screen and in life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans across the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know him and to like it. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas &quot; were broadcast some months ago with a big success on the chain TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The recording of five episodes is already ended for the second season and a sixth is under way of realisation, informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> At the moment, neither Warner or puts snow chains on it TNT communicated on the way will be included the decease of Hagman into series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Native from Strong Worth to Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew publicity with classical writings as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was another teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Well Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on the stages of the theatres of New York at the beginning of 1950s then served in air force from 1952 till 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It is there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator of inside Maj Axelsson and that he married him. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived on many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where inhabitant of many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he called his memo &quot;Hello Darlin&apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Bruise end My Life&quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&apos;: The pitiless memo of J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I wrote nothing in this book which could hurt somebody or affect him anyhow&quot;, he declared to the press at this instant. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his transplant of the liver, he became an activist of the donation of organs and worked as volunteer in a hospital to assist the anxious patients. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I recommend it, I give again to them confidence, I come with them when they come to have an operation and afterwards&quot;, he tells in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to give them a little of consolation, as &quot;do not be afraid, it will not be easy for a little while, but it is going well to go&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He was also militant against the tobacco and participated in several countryside. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A lesson treating the &quot;Purpose of the world&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Every week, the students explore apocalyptic topics as nuclear war, zombis, viruses and germs and climatic warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semestre, when the professor of religion Stuart Charm√© decided to give a lesson towards the end of the world, he knew that he threw an overpowering hook there: the end of the &quot;big discount&quot; of the Mayan calendar, December 21st, to which refer many people as being the proof of the imminent end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But the Charmed professor had no idea of what waited for him in the course of next months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax chasm which some people nicknamed &quot;Armageddon of debt&quot; and an increasing conflict implicating Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would start. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I did not realise that it is going to be the most apocalyptic semestre which I have never known&quot;, declared this week the professor Charmed to his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If they analyse what took place in the world today as though we were 30 days later and that we tell it, it was a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it is necessary to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor to give of lessons over &quot;the purpose of the world&quot; this semestre, which will be, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker gives lesson &quot;Media, culture and at the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, the students explore apocalyptic topics as nuclear war, zombis, viruses and germs and climatic warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyse it because these ideas proliferate with time&quot;, he declared, and the way they give hypothetical scenarioes guides some human behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear weaponry threw a war in terrorists&apos; hands, for example, would be possible burst. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students will analyse films having apocalyptic topics and study how they can be compared with examples of real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to inform my students on what was possible, probable, credible and impossible&quot;, declared Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of l&apos; State university of Pennsylvania, the teacher of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an additional teacher of History of art and of Anthropology, teamed to give a lesson, simply called &quot;The purpose of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add &quot;2012 &quot; to have the possibility of giving lesson again, in case the world no disparaitrait no&quot;, declared the professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In spite of &quot;imminent disaster&quot;, the students have to study, create plans and take their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the state of Pennsylvania, final examination will have passed the day before the Apocalypse, what does not leave in student of other choice than to work &quot;till the same night of the supposed purpose of the world&quot;, declared Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Courts turned out to be rather popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;He was complete in two hours&quot;, asserted Restall regarding the lesson intended for the students of high level, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We received messages by email several weeks before the beginning of the semestre, on behalf of persons who asked if he still had room there. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, from their part assure that lesson is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people are capable of making to restore the strength&quot;, declares Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, native to Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fright of the Apocalypse, that it is ancient or religious, is only a question of consolation, or of absence of consolation. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Infirmary of 25 years, asserts having viewed all apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard about a lesson which taught this material&quot;, he pointed out. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate him. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the questioned students, and even less a professor, told us he believed in the date of the end of the world of December 21st. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first plan treated Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it&quot;, declares zegle Julie, student of last year with Temple, 21-year-old and native to West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayan have never predicted the purpose of the world, it is only about key date on the calendar, declared Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I concede that there is an anxiety linked to the apocalypse in the Western culture, going back up in several centuries, which makes that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the purpose of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet caused a development of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places of the globe, people do not think of it&quot;, he assures. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> It is in most about the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University The Room which gives lessons in the Philippines this year, answered fast when they asked him if he knew that lessons over &quot;the purpose of the world&quot; were given here. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world&quot;, he answered us, as though it was about an exception from the upper authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a favour of the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall points out that over the years, they spoke about many supposed dates of the last judgement, and he maintains that if nothing takes place on December 21st, &quot;people are immediately going to begin thinking of next date&quot; or philosophise about the fact that December 21st marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The students and the professors get the date from the light. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several people said to us that they thought to go to holidays &quot;of the purpose of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Sometimes, I call friends and we have fun there together&quot;, commented Samira Ford, student in communications of 20 years. </seg>
