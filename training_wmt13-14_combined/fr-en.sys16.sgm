<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their politics-by-war need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Centre Brennan as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Indeed, Republican lawyers have identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments passed from 2009 new laws making it more difficult for the registration process or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections that saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters present a photo identification card and proof of citizenship in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce part-sessions vote in advance, invalidates the right to register as voters on polling day and withdraw to citizens with a judicial file their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state to ask such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of the Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Narco-banker republican authorities to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsorship-in draft laws in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card). </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have an universal identity card as the map of health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a piece of identity. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars for the identity card required. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and those on low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35 000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students, more voters considered voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID cards issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same states allow members of hunting and fishing clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote). </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns have contributed to record about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped from 17 percent the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It was the same with Hispanics). </seg>
<seg id="40"> They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of people who voted. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, the whites who made up 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters voting. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly objected to the adoption of laws restricting the voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the laws are more controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounced the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states). </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical procedures). </seg>
<seg id="55"> What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to move from screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control group, it is therefore difficult to interpret this data and recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one in Europe, found a difference in mortality among patients who were screened and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastasized if it is not detected). </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend that the test at the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if it was a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive and other cancers that are feeble. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to understand the degree of risk to the patient&apos;s cancer, by offering options, it is not necessarily the prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and in these cases, opting instead for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men whose cancer is detected will not be addressed, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It will suggest to active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it determines the precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with their doctor to determine if it should happen or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool for evaluating the pros and cons of the PSA test). </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (in English for the time being, a translation will be available shortly) to this address: http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Preventing the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, it could prevent 30 percent of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; said Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Society of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many are also totally unexplained). </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> That night a lot to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; deplores the spokesman Andr√© Beaulieu). </seg>
<seg id="85"> Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity during a lifetime protects against colon cancer,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Feedingstuffs </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too much, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer). </seg>
<seg id="93"> Also processed meat products, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat from drying or curing, smoking can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explain .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their findings are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies of vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clear either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his own concerns and family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;From a screening test, it is not cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs shelled </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery likely the Higgs has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that the Higgs is the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;less worse&quot; explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically). </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that this is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and it is very similar to the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data revealed this week at a major conference of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it is still waiting for the data to be absolutely sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose that it is the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, an inescapable inevitably law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you are going to hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yet even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law like this: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;rule&quot; of more or less in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, particle physicists classified into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, there are good citizens appointed close, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli). </seg>
<seg id="117"> And the other had been agitating the dirty provide-for, a bunch of anarchists who have respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Then, they are divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The FWMB Adventure, Berkeley: -meson Laboratories, that we will not be here, and &quot;particles of force,&quot; in which the great forces of nature are spreading and that the Higgs would be related in some way .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons-l√†, it must be stressed here, are not all the bugs as exotic as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a Higgs of extraordinary banality: esnergy, or the &quot;particle of light&quot; that is the &quot;messenger&quot; of electromagnetic force .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, this &quot;disturbing&quot; the electromagnetic field in this location, a bit like a pebble in a pond). </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or ultraviolet or infrared, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than one-photon - and therefore, one of program-carrying particle-physics &quot;force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true with the Higgs, with the difference that it is another sector, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; that the Higgs appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, there is a very, very high energy, almost as if it were a frozen pond only a very big rock could ride the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator at CERN - such as the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference! - To achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> These are not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field). </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never of himself on an ice. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the graviton. Wish) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what does &quot;can provide&quot; all the research, asked Ms. institutionnel? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also enables physicians to look any gap between the observations and predictions of MS). </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also more anxiously desire, as can be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has a huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the severity (oops!) or dark matter, which is about 80% of the raw material of the universe (re-oups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But it has found no such differences at CERN. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research in the daily lives of man and woman in the street, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no legislation. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Keep: in the early 60 s, the laser, pioneers in the Bell Laboratories, do not suspect the revolution that their work would. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, has already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has developed the first continuous laser (the first was Radiofrequency-on), in 1962, the laser was initially seen as a &quot;gimmick Recov.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from any instruments surrounding research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during its work. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not at all its original intention, is now a &quot;eye&quot; to all digital cameras of the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die... | The Duty </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Commission die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume shortly as a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Duty has tried to take a closer look. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer who had left him a reprieve of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I made seven years,&quot; he says, &quot;yes, lying in bed at home Victor-Gadbois, Meneray palliative care, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, it cannot be prepared for it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is his work: a huge weakness to go only to the toilet, and even to eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Over lunch, he accepts appetising to get help to eat, resigned). </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him, give him his medication, to offer. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I am cure diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;During our lives, we learn that a man, it pisse standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois). </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept the decline, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the view of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the heart of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of living up to three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them, provides more so-called curative care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die &quot;aware and stifled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;My wishes in life,&quot; she says, before being able to ask a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It looks, in the next few days, his son&apos;s last visit to Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> To Victor-Gadbois, it provides, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is the palliative care, that when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make their lives more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11 700 people. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little you finit all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, &quot;says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In terms of physical, emotional or comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The dying, it will agree to provide oral care at brandy or Pepsi, according to the request. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer be required to monitor their rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, it was served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who completed beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It helps families as much as patients,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At home Victor-Gadbois, the days go by but have different characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Alongside a 93-year-old man who savoure its final assembly of family in the courtyard, although stalled in its oreillers while rap in his honour, a 36-year-old man has died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer under the age of 45,&quot; is concerned about Dr. Christiane Martel). </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47 percent come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care that is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the final stage of his life, whether at home, in hospital or home care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and palliative care at home Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in care. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great failure in health care qu√©becois who fear to several doctors specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto, signed a palliative care experts including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebecois health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient to spend 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, without creating the need for relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care). </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists is stalking their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostications. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of H√©l√®ne Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a chemotherapy challenging one. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I would have to stop the treatment, she said she regretted that I stop fighting, &quot;she told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that I was finished. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> The WFAD Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die thank caregivers not to have complied with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie-Bernadette Monereau, director of palliative care in the home palliative care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment against the pain in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors have so often use palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, sporadically, permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend not to hear that part of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation). </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you to euthanasiiez&quot; means &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> This report was made possible through a grant of journalism from CIHR.. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the roads, construction contractors, fundraisers and political parties and Italian Mafia experts tell every day what they know of a formidable &quot;system,&quot; mixing construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso). </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; at great cost to taxpayers qu√©becois, especially in the 1990 s and 2000 s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious as the system crumbles since it took the big ways,&quot; jokes have been made about Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, through a background investigation on corruption related to road work contracts in Quebec, the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had agreed to. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report&quot; Pierluc established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he insists, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,&quot; some sion-makers their instincts to receive a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Hozapfel &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he says, in the hope that it gets to &quot;demonstrate the tricks behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts in the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> &quot;The more the police squad,&quot; which, since 2009, would have led the &quot;cartel&quot; of Montreal sewers to apply the brake on revision-reconstruction contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has carried out searches in series and made accusations of fraud and corruption against city officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned his position as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is alleged to have pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts. </seg>

<seg id="227"> It caused a sensation by explaining to the Committee on the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has paid for 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait money to Montreal, the party of Union mayor Gerald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. zambito has sown in all directions in the 2000 s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to the provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the ex-vice-premier liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It was sewage contract costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was operating smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, a former public works, detailed before the committee: in ten years, it has received from construction companies state-give, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736 000, in exchange for sewage contracts that it exaggerated the costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other road officials have admitted having made smear by pumping up from 30% to 40%, with fake invoices extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblays of deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel hysteria-fuelling budget coffers with money laundering. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal elected to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the district of Rivi√®re-desPrairies, east of the island, it has drawn up in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought and sold $5 million... 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom. </seg>

<seg id="240"> The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, she said that she &quot;draws on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> It is in the process of cleaning the wound but there should be a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a day before, so as not to see a return of the dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As it is the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Pierluc notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is primarily concerned with the role of elected &quot;aware of the ruse,&quot; when they dipped in the politicking. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Believing a 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: &quot;They told me that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebecois government proposes to limit to $100 donations to political parties but this will not change the situation, he said: &quot;As long as it is not strictly limit election spending, there will be a dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding state contracts and financing of political parties: &quot;We cannot go lower; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on a firmer footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, invites those who laugh to watch in their own backyard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The non-graindependent is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken a higher profile with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I progressed to their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also gave me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Every day, these elements lead me to lift my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the game, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Fast-forward in soccer. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I did not catch fire. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My early days at the centre of the preformation INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always put forward by a number of milestones. </seg>
<seg id="262"> So you take advantage of competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer&apos;s recruits are used to playing matches at the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The fact that a player like me wants to cope and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by coadjutants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> ancelotti is the man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It was a great experience and has won many titles with clubs toWoodpeckers). </seg>
<seg id="273"> He flirted with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a comforting discussion with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I am a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> It gives me confidence also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> How would you assess the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In 1, League Lyon we took over as leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final 8 es and with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in the competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But it will have a say in the face of very good teams in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to finish first in our chicken, in Porto, in order to receive final at the 8th anniversary of return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The non-graindependent can become a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He was already in the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and to register. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the non-graindependent is making every effort to make this project happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In League 1, not to win the title, as last season, would be a failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it was really committed to pocket the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it has not gone away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there has been a disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It has been a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has made a further season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think this is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media wait too? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is reasonable to expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept it in full. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Later, when it won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to be ashamed of, it is sure that it is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not the FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to establish a game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It has shown in the Champions League that they could attend. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, who are not, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the 8 es, they have also made huge expenses. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of investments, you imagined him by 15 percentage points to the truce. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been inspired by the new. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in the month of May we will have a smile that, despite all the difficulties, it was eventually prevail. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The non-graindependent seems totally dependent on the deeds of Zlatan Ibrahimovic). </seg>
<seg id="320"> All the better to say that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It is time for that and it proves that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He demonstrated wherever it happened that it was a great player, a star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, it respects the rights and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This pushes the other to lift their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you experienced Euro 2012 with the French team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had committed to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury I have not been able to gather in time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things over there, and I was strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I can achieve good matches in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I expect from my baptism with. </seg>
<seg id="336"> It has learned from what happened in Ukraine and it needs to set an example. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How would you assess the early months of Didier Deschamps, the head of M√©e? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well placed in the epitheton group for the tradecenter. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and the wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was Laurent Blanc). </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to do the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had achieved its goal of qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the M√©e in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good no one (1-1) ripped, on 16 October, Spain is a founding game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each has fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the opposite, based on current currency exchange of central banks, and transactions of treatment costs between the stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, the banking monopolies, led to the financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of bittorrenting, which allows the exchange of files in hand to hand. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions have been recorded through 15 000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen (prices are listed at bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a virtual currency report published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It bitcoin describes as &quot;the virtual currency with the most successful,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as &quot;credits,&quot; used to make progress in a video game that wins by playing or can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time, a central authority control and trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the knots of the network are both book depositories, auditors, issuers, and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that an user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by an encryption system to double. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins mutually-traded do exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The milestone is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line). </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is a phase hashtable file, a transformation that is a big file in a shorter digital footprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number before grinding &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number that gives a special footprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once the number found, other knots check that this is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the mark. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, an user wanted to pay twice for the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have different fingerprints). </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins). </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until one hundred millionth, leaving the room... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had their ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The fault is not used the protocol itself,&quot; provides Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company in real currency payment using the network Bitcoin). </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also mentioned the possibility of money laundering through this service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash has also this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Serious players such as Wikipedia refuse donations. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress,. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins movement. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, the &quot;giant&quot; balances have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on the currency, teaching is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but he uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> All they need to provide an address, a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general view of questioning the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems). </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report, expected to reassess the risks, today considered high, in the event of success of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We went to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is the Afghan farmers that we punished as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we, with our 88 soldiers killed and injured, maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, some former refugees in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, as the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their archaic and old traditions, even if they have been joined by Pakistani jihadists, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik, .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will be more when Westerners will be. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, that I have seen from the top of hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and tanks joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advanced from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country torn apart as a result of fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country was seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price for these farmers obscurantism overwhelmed by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahedin, current Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in a position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They became wheeler-dealers, taking up government land for resale in land for housing for refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with the huge U.S. contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They face; most of them have not fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to go, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: capital flight. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have passed through the modern world at their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, government schools are full, girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will provide jobs for these young people who want to return to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its Turkish soap operas that have a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities that the commission will be seen as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are concerned already rebuilding provincial militias, who escape to the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to enjoy a degree of decentralisation, the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country is, since the 50 s and long before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been getting, no dam is, no major irrigation system is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by three decades of war, a government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth). </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that Westerners n &quot;were there to get their hands on them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to deal with the copper and iron ore on the spot, or means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left for Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal reports). </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of French troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, Department of English at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archeologico. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, in an attempt to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, a service of &quot;civil-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, led, and carried out by a small French NGO, collective interest proven-by and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, domestic RNPE energy-intensive, could help to contain the insurgency: drinking water, irrigation, wells, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase the amount of land available for cultivation. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What are we going to remember, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of living conditions in these valleys harsh local, often located in more than 2 000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy has received dozens of written applications of small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To release of the insurgency waged by foreign groups, that farmers have told me, we should keep in their favour a small civil assistance, well controlled and that affects them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution bludgeoned in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi). </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play staked everything .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everybody by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had given two months to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> That is almost two years that Egypt is based on a provisional text amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal scandals). </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, President pushes ahead with his &quot;autocratic&quot; delirium, continuing to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trample on the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a means to an end with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held in two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which obliges the Muslim Brotherhood to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute is raging across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the U.S. weekly Time). </seg>
<seg id="464"> Especially since the use of a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, I popular-albeit full powers,&quot; supposedly must come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most Democrats were missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, believing that it was unable to express their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the quorum is reached, 11 people, members replacements, were added to the rush, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were adopted. </seg>

<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>

<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce exams was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Service of migration. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law comes into force, the human rights defenders have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what is it going to give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, meet the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people with &quot;slave labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Much talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, &quot;says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev). </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organized will solve the problems at 90% of workers abroad. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates). </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without an understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev migrant, the future is intended to meet some dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, it will provide a &quot;trip&quot; in a crowded DONNALUCATA him and dozens of others like him will undoubtedly agonise for months without food and without paper and realities-will toiling between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, we take their passports, and they do not receive their salary,&quot; confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of Tajikistan&apos;s migration service, Tolib Sharipov). </seg>
<seg id="612"> I do not stop, the police officer. </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many of the people of the Central Asian republics who want to make money in Russia entrust that they are not only the language of the country where they want to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> This is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a primary bad at all. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people are moving to make money as soon as the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when you don&apos;t know the language, willingly hand over). </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel diminished and diminished.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Human rights defenders note, however, an important aspect of the law on the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The reviews will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome to enter or defence &apos; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explained that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Why? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the mass-legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you can obtain a false registration quickly to only 1 500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police officers know that we have forged documents, that we have no registration, where cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; told reporters Akhmaddzhon Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Do not quickly, then denied and buy yourself a beautiful work of art &apos; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that the migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the federal service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Falsified documents emerging from a color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more than the official procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of power and human rights activists agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the review of the first time to attend language courses. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not know the Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with the people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior is not involved in arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carrying weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: it-parliament rocket performed at weddings or super-murder organized by the lawyer class-in-waiting Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age to obtain gun ownership from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma shortly. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;shaking the screw.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various fire, call centres to abandon this hardening &quot;crazy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, told the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a gun registered in the police while 1.168 crimes were recorded in the same period. </seg>

<seg id="667"> &quot;This is a small-scale local production, sometimes, a mafiafriendly formed and organizes the supply,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Whose arms? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for the government. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and RosStat, criminal records and public data portals on weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explained, comes from the army and security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of these weapons on the black market has found &quot;a lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons and explain in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17 percent of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from &quot;illegal searches.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="675"> A vendor and a teamdisband consultant who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one is buying the weapons found by these illegal search specialists; they are too old). </seg>

<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxury shop &apos; </seg>

<seg id="722"> United States: employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier&apos;s job at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages rise is charged by supermarkets Walmart and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken). </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will expand or die down quickly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest wage increases that receive basic employees in Walmart and fast-food chains, the organizers of demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when a rain flood of uninvited balances of millions of people in America and sometimes triggering clashes .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some Walmart employees of the company, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, have left their posts to organize picket lines with trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are aimed at consumers and small classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from layers of hunting rifles through the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many low-paid workers in Walmart shop only at their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of Walmart products have made one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products including because of low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain of difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklift trucks or scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the &quot;black Friday&quot; demanded a pay rise, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the basic in Walmart employee who receives $9.5 per hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is 1.1% more than it spends now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred any wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store, would amount to 46 cents. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and have brought no prejudice to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; has continued in the shops from 8 p.m. to midnight the following day and night Walmart sold on this period 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its coffers made a total of 100 million transactions for the &quot;black Friday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman Dan Fogleman assured in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post site that &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was a &quot;com&quot; operation of &quot;on the part of union organizer). </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Following customer!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests have continued this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage set by federal law and that of New York is $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food outlets are increasing over time, but on average, employees are plumbing in New York $8.90 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody paid less than they do in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald&apos;s after high school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself to interview employees of McDonald&apos;s who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with them. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don&apos;t know what you are going to eat. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators who have made a start on Thursday at 6 a.m. near the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 per hour, an increase of more than twice the minimum wage today. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also asked that the unions are created in the fast food. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of an union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration rarely makes their life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a trade union, to take over fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They disagree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains). </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near the McDonald&apos;s Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s announcement to sell billions of portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that &quot;we must all support employees from fast food to get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times characterized the event as the largest in the fast-food sector throughout its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people participated and all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is difficult to say if this will spark a mass movement of young. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, it is they-not to fool the brain &apos; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Recently, the fans of new technologies have become used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses). </seg>
<seg id="775"> Initially, Google has unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was revealed that Microsoft had made the request. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it is clear from the conversation with the director of the interactive 3 D technology Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of the company, the glasses are already history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by the creation of virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Can you say a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole has remained in the pixels on flat screen and sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We are looking at 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xboxchannel can sell today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - We also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on a real 3 D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technologies projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to get the computer in the world, in the physical world, making it more. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more convenient. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the voice command? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but not overstated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> You cannot say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we did not always want to inform the other of his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche-style). </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discrete gestures, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a wrislet brought to the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Currently it is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a clock. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + vote. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - That is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you ask me, you can miss that? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would do with the floor and with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Always, I spoke only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to force users to adjust based on what the machine may or may not do so at some point? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a near-rapprochement mutual. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work in the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These include laser sensors, they produce a good resolution and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If it is interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you do not like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition in 3. </seg>
<seg id="811"> It would be nice to get about 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 c /. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the megapixel themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Compared to the last point, all current technologies are quite good, this work adds to the designers of algorithms). </seg>
<seg id="814"> We must bear in mind the resolution vertical-longitudinal X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is also very much, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c / s really sufficient, especially for those actions. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave touch sensors scheduled a delay in treatment between 1 and 100 ¬µs, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would have needed a device of this type in my work, but does not require a touch, for more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But shouldn&apos;t increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras,&quot; one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a signal receiver. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third is in fact a camera sensor market-equilibrium scope. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help to define the locations). </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, walking all the time with a smart phone, catch-the-eye is not practical but here is what I think is the best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality that you would from a Viveret platform to move from glasses to the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device and that makes their strength (personal elements are those that you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from glasses do not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holoprogram objects in the air is more accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem that opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your re-vaccination. Group compared to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my way, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could very well be adding tactile sensations .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a medium of image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It records the pressure! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually designed to assign to these &quot;palpability of images in the air&quot;: for example, the interference of several ultrasound radiation directed at a specific point the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breath of fresh air on the ends. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that affect nerve endings of fingers, they are also introducing a line of work. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Believing that it feels it should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There are still remains a task on which it will take a long time to give the wrong: how to believe in someone who is physically in a very small space that it works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of race Vredeling (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), and also the jelly-babies mobile platforms. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, it is they-not to fool the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for the researcher: many things are still in absolute terms. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the Petersburg project &quot;vanguard&quot; dedicated to urban dwellers in advance, at the forefront of the culture and the arts. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list ultra-s√©lective has already hosted prominent actors in the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the painter impunitive Meerov Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The city has Meerov Miller, Taliban-looking rather man, dressed in red that can sit near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in festivals and exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The Meerov Miller always crowds gather, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of storytellers-men social and philosophical, basically, one of the founders of new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Meerov Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance made people smile and puts in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by virtue of its existence, its philosophy and its image of Bohemian). </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Meerov, why are you read through the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the red as designer specializing in appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, everything is not greycloth raises aggression and agitation negative. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to go ahead with the debate. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize that you had to be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - The exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that it was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of unofficial painters was old and the new, free, in my kind, were prevalent. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started my friends with painters of the new wave, with the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya- 10&quot; and then there has been more vague. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in the theatre, in fashion, music, all types except for words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And while it was in your artistic Clinic... It was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative resources. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I have taken place in Pouchkinskaya- 10 that housed before the work a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian Club, home of the Petersburg power-battles). </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project &quot;The ear of Van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> chnour and his friends sang songs easy in playback in tight shirts, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to perform live, it has become &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> trakhtenberg drove a lot of emissions before the era of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but its basic education and training, it is here that he has received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Kolegium &quot;D137&quot; Club &quot;Griboedov&quot;: the impact of the Clinique art. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are left as used to. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, a period when meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: &quot;The price was the personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I have been appointed &quot;Painter of the Year,&quot; and that is when my reign came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a style recognisable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - A lot of my paintings are Quebecian, they have a very topical and acute. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to have a scheduled exhibition &quot;The Russian museum through the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a timeless category). </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was someone from social, today it hurts and it is fear of being so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, disappears, the tragic fall. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I like the grotesque, I have ideas absurd. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the total non-flame-proof and mandatory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the habit is important, we look to the outside, but not inside. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Maybe you can&apos;t give him a hand, but rather to spit at the tronche. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And lies will be erased by the non-flame-proof). </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else but I can play. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But perhaps that commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today, commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur). </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the power-battles liked one thing, the dumb one another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into separate, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollars to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, we need to think about who you&apos;re liking. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But several thousands of people come see Stas.! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - These are people that have been laid to come see, this is the sexual and social side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less than management, money, everything is dying on its feet. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the essential thing is not to make mistakes, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted a collectionneur tables has hung beside Falk or Larionovs). </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the usual tables are those painted in end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, it is often confused with ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> We are told that there are spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who were living in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Meerov, what is lacking in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts). </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But all may not work in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> During the reign of good tsars, it wasn&apos;t like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there is now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts who accurately assess these experts and pave a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;rule of taste&quot; that flower. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there are many more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And our stones, art is struggling to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, this is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious who will see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> At home, this layer is. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make the fashionable art as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>

<seg id="939"> &quot;This is from Venus and Mars,&quot; said Vladimir Sourdine, astronomical researcher of the Institute of State and Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If the conditions are more suited for life on Mars, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> It is impossible to live there at very high altitudes or on Venus&apos; orbit... In space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It began to take an interest in matters of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a century ago, it carried out experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown into orbit is in no way differentiated varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then, it was put into orbit, insects, small flies Ô¨Çies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo in weightlessness airport-independent). </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get to the exit sacrilize a completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the sacrilize must find a medium, he must get on its feet and start moving,&quot; said the director of the Institute&apos;s laboratory problems after the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev). </seg>
<seg id="950"> With no support, the chicks are waved disorderly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 p.m., the new born saw their instincts entirely atrophy. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks do not react to light or sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they simply die after a few days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We were witnessing their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them over there,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev by noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;biological&quot; miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the &quot;biosatellite Bion, will take on the species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it has found nothing. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience. We need to do this kind of research,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev). </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it still fails to make reproductions directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their instincts. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, humans can, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create an emotional substance. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women are in the area for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova). </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity is more valuable. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our tern-like has soared, and no one on Earth could not say whether he would hold after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody responded to this question,&quot; said Vakhtang Vatchnadz√©, retired rocket sector and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a young daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut). </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice into orbit and have even worked in a space walk, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk continues. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very little, very little cosmonaut who did nothing and give birth to offspring in full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, it is dangerous even during flights in orbit,&quot; concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia&apos;s hero, Koneƒçn√° Poliakov). </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity). </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre for preparation of cosmonaut: compulsory stage of preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in no buoyancy-corrected, cosmonaut train for extra-vehicular exits). </seg>
<seg id="983"> The weightlessness of water). </seg>
<seg id="984"> If water is comfortable for adults, but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> To the extent that the baby is moving about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb of its mother, it is easier to get then. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is logical in principle, because since its birth to its first bath, there are only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very unlikely to forget,&quot; explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova). </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if for just being created the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs, a force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, belly muscles atrophy basin, very quickly, the baby&apos;s ability to pouss√©e is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Many agree, don&apos;t know it based on simulators to birth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course, you can prepare a confinement in a special chamber, the woman will do so out of it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then?&quot; Asks Koneƒçn√° Poliakov to invite them to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs a gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the Earth attraction, the body does not form the skeleton nor the muscle system). </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for training, as it were. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of its vital requirements. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully d√©sadapt√©&quot; provides the Director of the ethics committee of the Institute of the problems the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov). </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in the area are still in theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time it becomes a reality, when Moon-dust will visit their shuttles to a distant planet who will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the CSNs (upper Audit Institution) said: &quot;the control of pseudo selfemployment (in Czech,&quot; ≈†varc &quot;) system failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has qualified inspectors and quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the public finances in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is missing here,&quot; said Killa-Udaysah in his commentary on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control conducted jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot;system ≈†varc&quot; by Petr Neƒças). </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Prime Minister recently said that the ODS did not trouble entrepreneurs with controls, is permitted or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to act to go inspect to demand respect for the law,&quot; said Killa-Udaysah). </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a project in which have even been compared the laws on public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What does matter in practice? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> This is a parallel control that we have launched about two years. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national legislation as well as an actual practice to follow. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have gathered all of these things, and that this procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be &quot;more severe and better,&quot; but according to certain parameters, such as the practice is best in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help this project and does this for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should help us coming to try to clarify the laws, and to improve the thresholds, when it did not really positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good governance means get it at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the threshold of the markets, we may not achieve that goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a similar institution in our CSNs or a different way? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In terms of institutions, similarly to the CSNs Bundesrechnungshof, works there, which is organized similarly, it also has a board made up a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally so. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are also, to some extent, but similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also has the accounts of this type in the various L√§nder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The rDNA-based can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts of the L√§nder. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to national legislation, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but it has certainly do better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is also true that this country as a model is also faced with a series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have no benefit to cooperate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, the effects are already being felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment is relatively recently entered into force, it does not yet have an impact on our operations control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we do, there is some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our only concern, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of &quot;risk detection of mismanagement&quot; with which we have screened in nearly 14 000 public markets - that these changes will, of course, because the thresholds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will prove that. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can happen is that these rules have been tightened and that it is not possible to meet them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous regulations, the provider (for example, the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) controlled subjects had to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a failure to budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it useful to make the law more severe in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not in this way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> What, then, is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look where we are. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS did not trouble entrepreneurs with the so-called system controls ≈†varc - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system ≈†varc is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to act to go inspect and demand respect for the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We are going to change the law and allow,&quot; but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is missing here. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads are frozen in some places, but most remain feasible. </seg>

<seg id="1108"> This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we like fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Haitian Tap Tap, in rigole rather and we tell ourselves that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, you go up in December a completely unique project: three concerts against the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you offer more detail this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity that we are preparing for the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava). </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end almost at the culmination of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, in a time zone 12 hours in advance compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who was this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to set, with the public, reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created an unique collection of objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and the original key against the rest of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Haitian Tap Tap with other interpr√®tes has also seen an anthem against the rest of the world &quot;End of the world cancelled&quot; (in Czech, &quot;Konec svƒõta zru≈°eno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, they be heard also in these charitable concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the very end, finally, if we are successful and that the end of the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be chant√©e simultaneously by all interpr√®tes in three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Anthems will at some time in a live broadcast, utterly unique, television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The lyrics of the song were written by Tom√°≈° Han√°k who also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X is also sings... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How can you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We are working with other Czech show business personalities, because we have many concerts and charity events. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to involve hard on these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it was fun! </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the benefits of these concerts against the rest of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the Institute Jedliƒçka, with the association, and that for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly with students from the Institute Jedliƒçk≈Øv and their offer of interest and entertained by them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means to travel to the past, we are trying to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedliƒçka, we will transfer this project in a new building independent. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and interpr√®tes will rise on stage at each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> The criteria, you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a programme that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will rise on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Haitian Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω). </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all the details at www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Prepare yourself to other &quot;mega events&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring, again, we will surely be a quality program with guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Haitian Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tour? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not so terrible that it looks at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in electric chair whose bunker gear must travel, of course we trimbalons too many bags and boxes of instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything is still more or less well, CSA and British Airways were always fully prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently come back, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access for people with reduced mobility, the public&apos;s attitude towards people with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiences to date? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have witnessed in Moscow that is all that is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> From Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only in electric chair in the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there also, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements still depend on the efforts of the people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a serious handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, you, The Haitian Tap Tap, are rather the contrary to the cutting edge. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public and access are one thing, but the situation will gradually change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Haitian Tap Tap is currently very popular, back in a few years back, what you led in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as an educator at the Institute Jedliƒçka, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am myself (I musician plays, among other things, saxophon), with a colleague, we have created a business music. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, over time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç said, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success came in the last few years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, creating links with known singers and work actively to promote the group has helped. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if there were not in substance. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, we have quality teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Had you to achieve such a high level with The Haitian Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Show business is full of tricks that copy from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In some ways, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few original projects, and I daresay that Haitian Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned all beings, that we must take pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are described by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do good work, we must be firm in many areas and require a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to repeats twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve the objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Haitian Tap Tap currently has two members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> One, L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç). </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come and go, we cannot do anything about it. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the case the day before scheduled for the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 at 21 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, to Fl√©da Brno and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when chant√©e jointly the song of the Haitian Tap Tap &quot;The End of the world cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the partnership is to gather the financial resources (CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre which is located in Prague in the institute Jedliƒçka). </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket). </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland has been accepted as a twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and in the years that followed was involved in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road from Poland into space, however, started much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they were not always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like for example, the A. ≈†ternfeld conference in Warsaw, astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from its pioneering book entitled &quot;Introduction to space travel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) cercueil listeners cold and years later ≈†ternfeld recalled only Dr Jan Gadomski, interest in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, ≈†ternfeld won in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his book &quot;Introduction to space travel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became the great flameretarding astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on the subject of science. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a world-renowned flameretarding space travel, including his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> As early as 1925 was built in Poland railway to be equipped with a rocket engine). </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, there is neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was intended to propel or curb the railway). </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only known information on the railway are those of the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was conducted by the Institute Kom√≥rka Automobielbedrijf Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego). </seg>
<seg id="1212"> According to the documents held that such research had reached the stage of testing. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research is being discontinued. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, a photoelectic hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski, appeared in the press and the following year was published &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki). </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects were finalidad military use rocket engines). </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all projects to use of the technique of rockets were carried out by the provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (&quot;Tymczasowy zarzƒÖdu Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), which coordinated all work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war brought an end to its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish company astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, there is talk of a society in the November 1954 issue of the journal Probl√®me, in which four more detailed articles on aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> In early 1956, the Polish company astronautics (PTA) skin-supple efforts to enter the international astronautics federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the WPs in became a member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the WPs, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the Federation space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He retained his position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the WPs made a significant contribution to the successful development of meteorological rocket RKBs (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, in 1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a range of 1800 metres was a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently, an improved version was built in 1, during the summer of 1959, the rocket flight tests to two floors in 2 were started in the desert, Bledov). </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and probably weighed 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Following the prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - the RM- 34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development work was halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor- 1 rocket development during the period 1962 - 1965, they installed the first type rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor- 1 A, 1 B and - 1 C) were developed and are distinguished by the size of the space for the tools of science. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor- 1 A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in this volume Meteor- 1 B was Meteor- 1 C in 0.34 litre and 0.62 litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum scope of all these types of gear was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor- 2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor- 2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions were built Meteor- 2 H and Meteor- 3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It should also make a reference to the entry of Poland Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee, two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the program Interkosmos, Poland has also been involved in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miros≈Çaw Hermaszewski became, after non-sovi√©tique cosmonaut Vladimir Remek, the second of this programme. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on community service is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public utilities. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has raised public opinion in a deep discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and free movement (unlimited) private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The significant differences in the price of work (salaries) generate tension on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term meaning: a producer is working with the importation of goods sold cheaply to resist economic competition in &quot;making it more expensive for the price of a competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buy cheap or disappear. The result is high unemployment in the countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no social responsibility and a duty to unemployment, the state&apos;s payroll taxes are rising. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the utter unwillingness of contractors to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole in this race for profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies create a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the standard of living of their own people in order to attract the foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the collapse of society. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This occurs mainly in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to force economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This occurs by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the area. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, it has been around for years, public distribution points for food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already a million of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a supplement to the bare minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The cutbacks of virtually all the southern countries of the ŒïU generate, undoubtedly, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to migrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century), or just stumble along with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> We must now ask: where will this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or Africans will continue to work for a fraction of a salary in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media, to be tired, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the command economy led to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital is very much in the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1271"> One does wonder if private capital does not influence and, even today, does not drive, according to its own selfish interests, and by the same policy, the State. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer is definitely yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is a lobby almost omnipotent and present in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation is in the field of corruption, through mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The entire power comes not from the people, as the state Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups for their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies competitiveness-orientated liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The State has long been a deteriorating and functions were attributed by the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The bribes, favors obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used for these positions. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The kickbacks and corruption tall-shrub without limits and people went to the elections with votes already sold ...&quot;&quot; The honest does not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State stayed 8 months without consuls ...&quot;&quot; It really began to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and the need to choose a strong man ...&quot; It is true that Appianos Pompey had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in ancient times, today&apos;s society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to represent the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to make major reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must therefore seek the causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> As things stand, the disappearance of these systems for lasting market democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current √©lites totally ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, social and humanitarian crises that we are witnessing today as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by history and recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on community service is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the standard of living of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is indeed. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is subject to political reforms, which will strengthen the capital investment in the economy, will increase the influence of the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will ever of violence and never will,&quot; says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main thing is to &quot;let us not forget how we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my son did not want war, there would be no,&quot; said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild&apos;s wife on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are taking the side of Israel, arguing that its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about who is guilty and who is a victim, in his recurring waves of killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a view located &quot;behind the curtain&quot; on the one that benefit mainly the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small country in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of the oneself-or of group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is essentially the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they were accountable to the throne to someone who ran their actions based on goals set previously. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration causing some powers could not be done in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the families with an astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule it out. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> By the 90th century, they have acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts for which they were involved and that had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, increased their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in almost most central banks in the world and prepare or conducting wars against the country in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq in 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only from 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America, the status of central bank and began to issue its own money (government during the civil war, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to make clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, Louis Techniiian was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a case against the EDF for provoking the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for global power has led in the 1859 s to 1871 in the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a member of the Freemasons initiated in the 33th degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies in Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, including the United Kingdom, and the third is expected to reduce the world&apos;s population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (so many slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families headed the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - œÑhe after chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those that they began in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Czarist Russia in the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended abruptly by a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For a price-trigger easier to World War II, the bankers have left politicians create a latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany to non-traceability war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (then all they need to place a strong enough leader, pointing a finger at the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (it was actually a fifth column) to crank up and start a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches staked its claim to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of Judea history with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began). </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held; or if all he did was planned, but the fact remains that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as war reparations imposed on Germany were at the root of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire that could provoke a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers come to war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab population generally or the Muslim Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just look at how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong girls-means another wrongly in a never-ending circle of violence and where it is at the root of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> We need to make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers, people in elections that offer their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician fascistoid, loyal to the international bankers, who is to start a war with Iran, which could be due to the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) to enlarge into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the world&apos;s oil (this naval corridor has a width of 2 miles) and a destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which any new born is implanted at birth a chip making him a totally controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;They are forcing all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and enslaved to focus on the hand or a mark on the front, so that it can neither buy nor sell the one that does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> You have to understand: that the person who has a good sense of the numbers of this beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This number means and it is six hundred and sixty six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film L5A: when everything is worse than ever, called Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held hostage 52 diplomats. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the U.S. administration of positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to secure the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the prestige of the United States, a further exacerbated by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate in the United States created a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian). </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian d√©b√¢cle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film L5A, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode in the history of a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before she was fleeing occupied, six employees at the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a few detours complicated, they found themselves in the ambassador&apos;s residence. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in getting them out of Iran through an incredible coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a camera crew come to rep√©rages for a film set in great spectacle of fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Gender mix </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan for the expert in slipping Tony Mendez proporcionar√°n collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make more credible legend, specialized GGE03 did state of this film, press conferences were held and a fictitious company had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez). </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film, Affleck is an unusual combination of several kinds. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller designed realistic but also a &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy, d√©pr√©ciation and the Ocean&apos;s Thirteen .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The&apos;ambiances have increased: Tehran sequences documentary style (in subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the days of events and how, through these pictures, these same situations have been recorded in the film, there are no major differences), </seg>
<seg id="1355"> The lighter parts of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then the scenes of CIA headquarters and other institutions with men QUADRUPEDS discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> An actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and actor game ceased to generate wry remarks). </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature-lenght after dark policeman &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Park Avenue (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film, Affleck who does not take place in his home city of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put its first films over Hollywood standards). </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also evidence of this sense of the atmosphere in L5A where the role of Tehran &quot;held&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a given location, is writing a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his staff get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the false camera crew in the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many shares in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to be content with a subject with few exciting scenes film, within the meaning of the word. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the runway are rather far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of L5A lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have been worthy of a place and it is far from being alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film, Affleck lack a little dramatic tension, it is a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 70 s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> He leads the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a history yet somehow incomplete to date, and as an example the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and world-circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the regulation or ideas from &quot;the workshop EU&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU is considering, recently, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women on the boards of large European companies was at the root of our decision,&quot; said to the newspaper Pr√°vo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik Nacher). </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the European Court&apos;s recent decision to unify the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Yet to this day, women were an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively-speaking, less risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report until the end of the year while another incredible idea of &quot;the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, informed Nacher). </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the EU&apos;s controversial regulations, for example, the obligation to add fuel to the organic components, with harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of mercury thermometers, reliable because they contain only a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the Computer-Implemented caged egg size, resulting in an increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism has also been made in the past against the ban on using the term &quot;spreadable butter&quot; or the withdrawal of the sale. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> In the interests of the lobbyists are also, for example, led to the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be less than 14 cm or submit a &quot;abnormal curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended herself, arguing that it was only nonhomogeneous harmonization of national standards that have complicated trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some states, claiming that the existing guidelines are leading to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulations last year that must appear on balloons in a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without supervision of adults. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has made reference to an U.S. investigation that balls are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 for a break in the trumpets. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Here too, it was bizarre ideas). </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the &quot;Let Doing&quot; consisting of liberal economists, the server Bankovn√≠ poplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set the maximum volume for food reserves can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic, for example, then m.i.kutuzov volumes set for canned mushrooms and D.L.I., as a result, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this interesting survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of giving a subsidy to ask. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas are not from Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The failure of seawater. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union a refund. &quot;So said, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argues that, because of our production of wheat, and following the so-called &quot;interventistica&quot; purchases, the state found itself with full stocks that he had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU should have to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access to water. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for subsidies have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development headed by the Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU), they were, in effect, be used to write applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU said: &quot;the bizarre regulations are rare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations often attract criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts by the EU in the regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in its overall development, rather deserve praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other EU countries in Brussels, fighting for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fight that it no longer) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name &quot;Olomouck√© tvar≈Ø≈æky,&quot; for which the name &quot;Tuzemsk√Ω Decla&quot; going back home in the nineteenth century, producers had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzem√°k.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only products made from sugar cane alcohol, not out of sugar beet, may bear the name of rum). </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products in the EU, it is now known as the &quot;world with cheese or Gorgonzola, L√ºbeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits at Karlovy Vary (&quot; Karlovarsk√© suchary &quot;), the Poho≈ôelice carp and T≈ôebo≈à (&quot; Poho≈ôelick√Ω has T≈ôebo≈àsk√Ω kapr &quot;) and hops, ≈Ωatec (&quot; ≈Ωateck√Ω chmel &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread Pardubice (&quot;Pardubick√Ω pern√≠k&quot;) and the cakes called &quot;Cornets, Ho≈ôice&quot; (&quot;ho≈ôick√© trubiƒçky&quot;) can also be proud of their Community trade mark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want to save the Republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur, said Senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Senator, how was the idea to stand in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president that matters to me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything was operating without problems in our country, I am candidate anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t stand to see as the country was looted over the past twenty years, the thieves are not in custody and taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that does not please me, then I am trying to find a solution for that change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than four years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other options to influence the situation to stand in the presidential and senatorial elections). </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You are entered in the Senate but you have quickly en route to the Chateau (mountpoints: the seat of the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it that you do not turn their backs on the people who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I will in the battle for the Chateau according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Subsequently, I indicated that if I was elected senator, I will present to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, it is merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need them to exercise the greatest and the mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that, as a nation we r√¢lons in the bar or in front of our television sets, but it is also trampling on all those who are trying to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In addition, the press fragmenting the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It was, for example, said in my speech that I bribes journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Turning to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have started the fight for the Castle with the central themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To that end, you have to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tour guide is a profession, I have managed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is no: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As independent, a member of any party, I have many more chances to win the support of all parliamentary parties). </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able, without categorisation and dogma, take supporters of each party what is best for our country and implement them. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You feel rather like a man on the right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people rather put me on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that this is a bit to the left or right, this is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What matters to me, this is not that people are on the left or right but to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution that contribute to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you go when someone told you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you have said does not prove? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke were applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, you have that slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You do a certain amount for a long time in politics. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose liability mat√©rielle and criminal? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally to my camp to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality who will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president, it was achieved through the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, in no uncertain terms, to be a fan, not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and my views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just into politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority of my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I am trying, alone, to move forward, and if it does not work, I will stop in six years and I will return in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person cannot make a difference, that is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as senatorial elections .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> At least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√° who revealed the fraud to the oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I came because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have given voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Even so, I will fight for my vision, for example, the directly-elected mayors and prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you intend to base your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I do not have time to check if the past of each potential member is clean and then I don&apos;t have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about tax returns, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I estimated about 60 million the value of my property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a ground in Prague with a value of 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth approximately ten million, a&apos;Aston Martin worth $3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I have a&apos;Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always loved James Bond, who was strictly-worded by car, with women and fighting against evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive your&apos;Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million and you don&apos;t have money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I am into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested $2 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate a great deal of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live, for example, to pay my son&apos;s English school that costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my sole objective was to make money, I will in any elections. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will continue your business activities in order to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Did you said that you would put your activities toned down? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the amount of compensation. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people that I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But although I live for something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue to win between two percent and four percent. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my commercial activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in Saturday&apos;s edition of the newspaper Pr√°va). </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the law firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. For proof, one need only contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly built books - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think that this building is fun, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a roadside bandwidth on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company next door, we said: &quot;Yes, it is all well and good, this building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books). </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody will voluntarily in a think-tank of these libraries? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a bedroom community which is not attractive to Rotterdam doors, holds a record quite particular. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80.000 souls has the lowest literacy rates in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the shadow seven bridges on euro notes in the form of pretty small painted miniature in reinforced concrete). </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> For example, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to take the lead on statistics: the construction of a library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> winy reclassement, Rotterdam office of architects MVRDV, master diagrams in bold sticks and Ecobusiness buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual stiff upper and presented in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury watched again, confused and shrugging our shoulders, reclassement, the brazen, eider-down its books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and his speech was underpinned by a militant arguments: common! &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> There it is - my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros poured out. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project, which will also feature an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and mansions for a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books was awarded second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> That is how dull this small town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestriansed and a mayor of a staggering woe, whose white facades to think that they are home to a dairy, has been fueled by an architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado of the book under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Of course, you carry a lift at the heart of the shelter, but the real joy of reading and architecture are open to you when you disregard the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography). </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Inside entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in Dutch bricks and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already from the eyes of the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And around books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the library shelves are located along the facade and the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and open spaces of reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Inside the mountain of books has been skillfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, chess club, the centre for the environment and the technique of building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes, sometimes the child√ïs sometimes ramps, stairs. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for the sight, touch and smell .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers of hardened building materials do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trouborst, head of the project to the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard). </seg>
<seg id="1535"> For example, one day we found in a farm frisonne ad hoc waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, have been used for years in the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and it is gaining time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be. </seg>

<seg id="1554"> Indeed, a few weeks ago at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library). </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully ring-headed (today, it has 70.000 books). </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of observer state of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she then chose to abstain. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany do not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has a special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support America&apos;s position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> In the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, ŒùŒëŒ§Œü dictated this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany finds it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the lack of consistent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans therefore face on several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the path to a more normal &quot;foreign policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That means when the term &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to adopt positions beyond those of the United States and the European partners, including with regard to the issues. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced Germany&apos;s position regarding the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention from the United Nations vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany was first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is undoubtedly a decisive point. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I would not be too much, because it is not exclusively relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But this is certainly a key element in the strategic thinking in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany are we reducing its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain during important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think the gap is not as bad as in the case of the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps that Germany will be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the Palestinian all-product opinions are varied. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> However, the United States have announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of domestic politics in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is secretly very understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they seem forever. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not too keen on the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany finds it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the powerful European partners? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it does not help for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, this would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They cannot be included in a broader political line and must assert their unique position .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is what they are currently in the question of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will play a leading role in the future and will push Europe to adopt an European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany does not play an active role on the world stage, Germany will only play a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or has always difficult to play leading roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is always difficult to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, we see that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not help for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: it does not want to be surrounded by countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this perspective, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must cope with neighbours and a wide range of opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the United States &quot;influence on European policy is decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill the void, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are just less appreciated is life! </seg>

<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani Chinese suddenly become </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... What is it all about? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind the name is a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company). </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The mark enjoys protection as well as the company that bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, it is not clear that it would succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new file arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators require only a few additional letters to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny). </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also legally copy, as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> pattloch opens a filing the registrations to the Trademark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna S√õ√†7 Puma, a name that artificially created in appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of fashion. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is known that the Chinese have become world champions copy and the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are several floors to shopping malls that sell almost as counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The case of Pattloch are different: its principals load to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese talk about &quot;Bang-like Mingpai parent brand&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from &quot;Bang-like Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term than are women who are married to men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, we must fight against this trend,&quot; requires Pattloch). </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs amounting to millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the flagship products expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and the fastest growing quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to write off the register of dubious records brands and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> They can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> pattloch referred to the trial in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> pattloch tells us that if the complainant does not have a chance, it may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would have interfered with its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases are also of the charts. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that was to take over the concrete Putzmeister pumps). </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, Volvo, the Data-Loggers used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to amend it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against appuieraient of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the office would have happened last year in an emergency situation &quot;in the course of the work to a new-found normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> For example, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57.000 cases have been closed, an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 Provedoria procedures at the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for filing, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It would also for the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of law. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each registration reported an average of 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle cost much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Hilchenbach). </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is grappling with a plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Of course, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitador was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the mark Hilchenbach). </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault, because the family names cannot be protected in Germany,&quot; said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the leadership of Hilchenbach Chemical Specialties in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office had rejected the objection of Feld-herrnhalle. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Hilchenbach has won with two following bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Vigilance is called </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, he adds: &quot;the process is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archive service even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Hilchenbach had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a &quot;large sum in euros to six figures&quot; to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This is what we can see what it means for us,&quot; gives Wentzler). </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten even spill over into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if the imitators of this region provided the exploitation of brands not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wants to table in Germany on behalf of Hilchenbach for a company to produce footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> wentzler adds: &quot;vigilance is required.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1697"> pattloch and advise German firms to be very careful in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international brands, foreigners should also register &quot;in China, which is likely to be protected,&quot; as Wentzler). </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Hilchenbach lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company should pay a licence fee to the opposing party for using his own name, as Wentzler). </seg>

<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial IST, there are the chlamydi√©es syphilis and gonorrhea (or rrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The current IST is HIV, Human Papilloma Virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The pubic lice and scabies belong to the IST. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea are often among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert-Koch believes that the sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four out of five reported syphilis cases in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydi√©es, the thrichomonasis fungal, Moniliasis , gonorrhea and Human Papilloma Virus sexually transmitted diseases are common. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, but some 20% of new HIV infections occur among this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, there is a chlamydi√©es infections rates significantly higher than other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European records, three-quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In addition, in Germany, Human Papilloma Virus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the change in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not required to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were about 2.700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause genital level abscess, urinary pain, loss, pain in the lower abdomen and the emergence of buttons and verrucae. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect at 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through infected lubrication or personal contacts. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts therefore recommend to anyone often changing sexual partners to move regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the IST quickly detected can be cured and the late effects can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations, but especially for funds that are reaping the back-vocalists through their votes through Germany, ways. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200.000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and who always gets what it wants, manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that orphans are housed, in one of their grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The automoatically, for example, so-called old women in equivalent, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, it provides them with a roof and ensure that they make every day at a time in their school uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has no one is allowed in a safe place, in khanyisile, a woman living alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has created a fashion school and allowed the construction of two barns. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association has organized a tested for HIV for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a given, because even if the disease is clearly visible across the country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is a real taboo,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is an issue that affects sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is rather odd, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives). </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These statesanctioned mores, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> But there are condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, &quot;but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote the cultural exchange, choralists of Imbongi go together in trip every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the dark continent are still the days of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full of white people who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only good humour and joy, but he also sometimes a tear to some formidable border guards). </seg>
<seg id="1782"> It still takes the bus to Esitjeni, where choralists visit their godchildren). </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni). </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitjeni, you will find more light,&quot; say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a journey of 8.733 miles as the crow flies, return to Heidelberg, before these back-vocalists which type of foot in the repetition of the Bergheimer Stra√üe, there are also light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Checkmessenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Merkurij </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe checkmessenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained in three studies published on Thursday in the specialist journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe checkmessenger reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the world constantly immersed in the shade. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This would have a thick cover of at least 30 centimetres of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water comes probably comets or asteroids that could perhaps be struck. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, no one makes the connection between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, &quot;says the chief scientist of the checkmessenger probe, Sean Solomon). </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Merkurij can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements to life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed by inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, sending images to the land, such as small interstices through which it is. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute). </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres). </seg>
<seg id="1801"> As Pluto, which orbit around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet,&quot; according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> The detail of a photograph taken by the infrared Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and pink points, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;babies&quot; in the birth of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, called &quot;H1V,&quot; a romantic little name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6.500 light years). </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope photographed the brilliance of a flamboyant star dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> In terms of the double-donut circle is made up of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the vast Trifid Nebula, 5.400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room). </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pl√©iades piles of stars, also known as the &quot;seven sisters,&quot; can be seen with the naked eye during the night. </seg>

<seg id="1810"> On this, the n√©buleuse infrared photo of Parts.In, as red, looking directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a land continent have earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a hue. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the biggest riddles of Astronomy focuses on the creation of Saturn&apos;s rings). </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn&apos;s moon which has not existed 4.5 billion years without trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and clearer photographs that has taken the Hubble telescope is the galaxy of Vorticity). </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the hue, photographs of galaxies spirals can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the n√©buleuse Trifid&apos;s in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years removed from it. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The Trifid name comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, split into three), because three dust trails divide the heart glossy-blue birthplace of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Ophiuchus: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble telescope was the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname of &quot;M√ºhlstein Southern fire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the n√©buleuse of Iris, in the constellation of Cepheus). </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The n√©buleuse is 1.400 light years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than domestic dust common. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was developed from optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes). </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle composed of black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy &quot;GiC 1810.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this n√©buleuse is the group of young people the brighter stars in our Milky Way). </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by of the Rosetta, also create permanently young star 5.000 light years away from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy of light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is a gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the tolling, when the universe was made up mostly of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our view of the universe: the main telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo&apos;s long-established only a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, mirrors optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the PELLO PADAR telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Great Canary Telescope at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reached still about eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set in the vertical angle, which limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly Texas is also set in the vertical angle). </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its distinctive feature is its great capacity for collection of light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this ability is close to those of the largest telescopes to mirrors in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists are listening to the universe in search of aliens signals using the Arecibo telescope (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (ILRS, or &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;) with a contribution to the power of calculating its machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> On the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Andes, Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope (&quot;Very Large Telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, the telescope can inform the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of an European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1.000 items of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will take photographs before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii volcano were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope and FTIR). </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This allows illustration of love. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the most important space from the Hubble space telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990, it has produced images of worlds away. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler looks for exoplanets, mainly those privatives. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space in 2018 at the earliest aboard an Ariane rocket, 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first infrared space telescope&apos;s mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will have to find the light of the first stars and galaxies after the tolling). </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists believe that the South Pole, Merkurij also houses the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no reliable data on this theory, because checkmessenger orbit much closer to the North Pole on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> With the launch of the checkmessenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink butter every day, and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>

<seg id="1883"> Looking at the many turning points in the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers and farms foothills-type modest. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the Black Forest). </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which we know little, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and they have a very great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik). </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town plastronne too aggressive with its architecture from the Soviet era, which is not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road has only one direction. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a place of tourism. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision Song Contest, and there will be here next year, the festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; explains Fatulayeva). </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is the museum director of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> You can learn about the lives of about eight dozen groups in the region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Having a child at 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> When you consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of M√ºsl√ºmov seems more than questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,&quot; said Fatulayeva). </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and it would have been 23 children. At the age of 136, it would have been conceived a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> ≈üirali M√ºsl√ºmov would mistake a few decades in calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, research associate at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Older people surprisingly also live in certain parts of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; said Scholz, &quot;also in Sardinia, there are people who are incredibly old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Each day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> However, it is a fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age fit for patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> What is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh Azeri, the tour guide, explained that he had particular genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> However, Fatulayeva, the museum&apos;s director, believes that it is a question of food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the meals rich in calories of Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the young people? To Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva). </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the floor beside a churn, it beats the content. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children can also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for the guests served in typical in the form of armadus glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> A Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf long plaitings hiding a dark blond that his son tells us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, and that is how I have never lost, and they have kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; adds Mirzayeva). </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she talks about her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But while improved when the &quot;beloved&quot; father Heydar Aliyev took the lead. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, is almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> It was in power until 2003, his son Ilham they installed thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In any event, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps that the son&apos;s long greying Mirzayeva is right: &quot;the elderly enjoy great respect in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;Human rights&quot; failed in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution is in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations reveal the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Egyptian President is not short of words more emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must make the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was intended for the entire people, but especially to Coptic Christians, Muslims, Christians and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition hopelessly divided, confused and afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost in apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its ownand &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world does not really know what wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California). </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary be reversed? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the Islamic majority constituent assembly of 100 people during a night tour de force of fifteen hours are worrisome to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the case law is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is really the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists are using the vague wording and the resulting legal flexibility to implement a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case is that suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that all matters pertaining to sharia, Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance rayonne throughout the Sunni Islamic world .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor legislation, which would result in de facto control of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many parts of the draft constitution are food for interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the likelihood of military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these policy-framing courts to punish opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11.000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state must also, herum project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, this would be nothing short of censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In addition, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another rule prohibits to offend or slander the prophet Muhammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, the article does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many items are subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi shall submit to the vote, and who, in his own words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be subject to a referendum of the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The robustness of revolution &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is protesting for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution, and we will win,&quot; launches Hamdin (MB) came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former International Atomic Energy Agency&apos;s Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft constitution is &quot;to throw in the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi&apos;s supporters of trying to foment a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and is reversed,&quot; said Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been pardoned,&quot; said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to her. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;the people are asking for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Cleaning up our country!&quot; Said to Morsi, saying that &quot;the Koran [their] Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A battle for sovereignty over the symbolism from Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square, where it all began, would soon led to a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> In their view, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The Islamists will win the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned once.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed due to continue until February and include all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This human rights lawyer of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> It did not because he shares their view of the world, but because of his human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> That is why he has been beaten, tried and imprisoned. </seg>

<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most shuichangpu fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the local appetite for an extremely shuichangpu fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take the cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Jails in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the smell of rakfisk disturbing, one of the most popular dishes Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, at about 3 p.m. in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It is snowing, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout and spread too thinly and fermented in salt water for a period, according to the smell that you want it stinks - perhaps a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness set in and it is cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this culinary speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat, then you thought you a glass of aquavit,&quot; explains rlnd Halvarsen full-time local firefighter, also referred to as &quot;Rakfisk General,&quot; responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and&apos;enfilent a large amount of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer to rakfisk aquavit,&quot; adds rlnd). </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The beverage kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I tried a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid sinking it in your nose, it is not bad - it seems like a sushi who have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof barrels of water in the air, then ksinomizithra in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, a time of fermented fish came out, and - no doubt with the direction undermined by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> The previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals, the country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something important, vital, although shuichangpu, from Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is the most dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost Euro10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to approve. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to talk to ethno-racist Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about the killing, they talk about &quot;the incident of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians are finding it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 70 s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, blonde hair and blue eyes of a bloodthirstiness, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plateau of rakfisk by hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how do you say - people cautious. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like most people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great care - all, except for a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries laid money down the drain, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep its purse is tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As you can ski in winter and mountains in the summer, we are pleased,&quot; said Anna). </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;The rakfisk&quot; strong-competition in a carefree laugh). </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and I am in line for food - I had my dose of rakfisk). </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger made up of momentum, a real discovery is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I lived is one of the many places where there is the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the shuichangpu more of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV show where the presenter is a trademark, surrounded by rakfisk bases). </seg>
<seg id="2044"> You would think the Eurovision contest). </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What did you give the best score in the mountains Thor-Juergen fish?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here&apos;s our points, rlnd.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We hear the laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps it is because of the fumes. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is starting a difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, is interested in the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, results from outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already killed about 60.000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; said Mr. Pena Nieto at U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A sprawling and populous state gripping the capital. On his land of choice, the opinions on this new leadership is divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic, Valle del Bravo, for example, it is part of the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The premises attributed to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the policy. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made in the past, these roads, and full of crevices. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plaques bearing his name are hanging outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to establish lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the advantage of M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change in our country. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without the power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party on Enrique Pena Nieto). </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects the criticism of opponents to the new president of lacking charisma). </seg>
<seg id="2072"> This is a whole man, very committed, with a great vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, it is not always the image of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets and Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the highway, yet it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality is also practical. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military has been called in to combat drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster area, were found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1.000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the most violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the killings perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to accept reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fight to retain his tears when she shows me pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna). </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version reported by Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believe she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I came home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,&quot; tells the Tel√©grafos Buendia). </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and this was already underway. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross which contains the word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is exactly what the family has been refused. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossipy, a birthday, a main). </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and that it be cut off. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But this is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that it would make its priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be as good as chairman when he was governor,&quot; said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, say prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse including Bradley Manning would have suffered during the detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial is about Manning&apos;s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping and Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military - has missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing to Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that the recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have not shown any complaint about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination - during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the Manning case is dismissed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and was sufficiently severe punishment - took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that officers had met after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers asked to Manning and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke about the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he gave the alert was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had been in the prison was &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms are no complaint of mistreatment, although officers have directly questioned about his prison treatment, said Fein). </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take, but they have not recorded the issues raised. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They have&quot; no problem &quot; (after raising concerns), and that does not mean that I had not raised any problems,&quot; said Manning). </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning was also asked why he had not complained about his treatment in an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months ago. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a &quot;risk of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they had assigned this restrictive status - a level below the close surveillance for suicide risk - for its protection and safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to be cut off this status... In order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,&quot; said Manning). </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact that they have not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to the cage,&quot; said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in the cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning has also added that the only things available were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay longer during the day was against the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in their eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he would return at night, they bring in order to be able to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer filed a formal complaint in the case of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning has been placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also Friday, the judge asked to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday - after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of other prisoners and guards one morning during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to meet with a coverage during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the judge&apos;s questions, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of its warning that it was dropping its coverage that would have been able to hide its nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to give way. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning would have said to the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underpants or its flip-flopstyle to hurt themselves, but that it had not. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence if convicted in a court martial, a trial to be held early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defence said that Manning plans to plead guilty to less serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules governing the detention conditions of all detainees to Quatico). </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges brought against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all charges are retained, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans hard times, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> navarrette said that the Mexico-am√©ricains find themselves caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the hall, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two tracks: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros (&quot; √âtrangers &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood still for several seconds, not knowing what my leader. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I was known as the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is an ethnic epitheton, like the one my friends of Boston use when they say &quot;Irish,&quot; or my friends in New York when they say &quot;Italian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then, I became &quot;Mexico-Am√©ricain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land that my grandfather was born, there is no need for special epitheton nor an union. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I spoke Spanish, well enough to manage a maintenance in either language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native, and I can&apos;t lose my focus in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Then I took my American passport and I headed to the queue &quot;√âtrangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the President Obama at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their pet subjects are immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than to risk the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Trade Union along the lines of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto is committed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory in writing to the forefront of the gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, when an U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elites - complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma seek. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country with more than 35 million Mexico-Am√©ricains who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want that addresses the subject of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico creates winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, someone, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more often, this person was a typical profile - a dark-skinned, few educated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we are living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We are in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> On the other hand, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We recall a humiliating defeat and alike, as if we were people from lower strain and not Mexican enough). </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be quite strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we have gotten ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as the souls lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who has emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is friction between the Mexicans and the Mexico-Am√©ricains because Mexicans more firmly difficulties-particularly their identity and Mexico-Am√©ricains are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although American citizen, she feels a part of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> In addition, many Mexico-Am√©ricains I know did not feel part of a country or the other. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We worship music of Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen). </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in neither. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we consider the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And the United States, we regard as the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, making matters worse relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to move closer to the Diaspora .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico-Am√©ricains work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It won&apos;t happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if you consider the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You will have to fend for themselves, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have dealt with Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Am√©ricains always want them how their families were treated there not too long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Wouaah). </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Long-standing divisions, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a setback for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> It can never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed suggests that such hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While we continue to enjoy the same frivolous arguments about who began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near the metropolis of Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has been shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this upheaval regionally. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps their fight will increase even more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there is every reason to believe that this could help to break the deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser and no winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Although the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of force, on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza was kicking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> He killed some of its leaders and turned back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, Hamas leaders could say that it is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is becoming stronger, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas, like Qatar, one of the most dynamic and richest states of the Gulf .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Hamas members are clapping their hands and say that the Islamist is growing curve around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar al-Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous central and most Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its collapse in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily to the public. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a strong player who will no longer be excluded even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, hardliners of Israel would draw the necessary conclusions opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been questioned. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The so-called Iron Dome missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep at night - for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy world-America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that is encroaching on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and to protect the Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegal status in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with a party even more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader in the run-up to the election on 22 January, at the party. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why Palestinian indicative of pampering by giving them a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Had they been running the West Bank, does not cockleshells rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hit as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but it may be that the Arab Spring changer. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes - and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think about the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world that is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbates the problem as the Arab population is growing. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be driven by those from outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of land by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this case. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of arms into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs outside the country should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to coalesce. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal of a pseudo status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also benefit, if Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> They are a very little. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> It is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws on cigarette packets neutered-emperors came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and photos of diseased organs include dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Outside of the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the world&apos;s strictest rules on packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government said that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour). </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they start ever. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco companies through their brand image,&quot; said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek MP, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children were the crown logo to a princess. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would reopen the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The negative consequences of this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others said that it had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the request for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Zico has sold 6.000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, say experts, is the popularity of social media and people targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide the cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the unavoidable par excellence,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens for trademarks on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask ourselves whether this is a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who took the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries reported to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantage, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> MP said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning pictures on packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and the package,&quot; said Victor El Hage when buying a package that included a picture of cancer of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only reason I will stop, this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the centre of Sydney, said that the consistency of packaging made it difficult rangement packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I had a hour to unload a package, but now I have four hours,&quot; said Yu). </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to ban it once and for all, and we would have said OK, this is good, you stop and shut up,&quot; he said, spreading out his arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it may be useful to some lively debates. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport during the period after Thanksgiving, as our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend a day in an airport for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and Japanese-patented innovations to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise from boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to annoy from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain down, or even to feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly to several types of screens, we know that the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So should we welcome boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will return. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, like many people, I thought the problem was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, said Peter Toohey, a professor of ancient history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The problem goes back a long way,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then there is the definition that we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at New York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having travelled many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified the problem as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of the apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would wish. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, there is no inclination to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or the world, while depressed people believe that the problem is. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that we bored when it is actually a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Caution,&quot; which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have shown an earlier experience in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV show that had no connection, others have just heard the issuance of TV, and the third group has not heard the soundtrack). </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they had more annoyed that the two other groups - they have found it difficult to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate on a difficult task, or an interruption of the attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you make a boring task, &quot;like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bore you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, now we know that when&apos;armoire or UQUAM, these gestures, often seen as signs of UNMIG - are actually a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hindred learn more and more information than those who are forced to remain without moving,&quot; said Professor Fenske). </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all bored one day - my flight delay, a speaker with a voice in sparkle, a film particularly annoying. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to annoy than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;aumur predisposition to boredom&quot; in the 80 s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Musicians-performers includes statements such as, &quot;One of the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to annoy more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need incentives many and varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are quickly. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper). </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32 percent of adolescents mini-part-session dull moment at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent mini-part-session dull moment when they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported some lively debates. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is a time when the UNMIG reached its highest level,&quot; particularly because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I repeat it: boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes, as in its extreme form, it can cause people to take risks, make bets absurd physical or abusing substances to pass the time, as the studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The problem is the way that the brain was found to inform you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the Backs </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and that you give an iPad, it more, but he has learned to deal alone or to autor√©gler, said Professor Fenske). </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this autor√®glement passes from one situation to another,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of itself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think we should glorify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think that we should criticize him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable outside the constant Meox1 generated the activities and technology is the goal to which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need more often boring us, but by UNMIG awakens a frenetic and desire to be connected to something that makes sense,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time of arrest. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimul√©s,&quot; he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19, an university student and football player in Colorado, was charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: lettuce-fed possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that can be used to its consumption - minor crimes, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of court. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated as criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a small drug use depends on the place of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have continued to charge of adults aged 21 and over for minor marijuana possession, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in more conservative districts in Colorado have called to accelerate existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute people who possess. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West now vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the state in their neighbourhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so rapidly that I don&apos;t know what will happen in the future,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of AIMP, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in Washington are also a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most regulatory statements on marijuana, first on the therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could build, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> From Washington, which is called I- 502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a gap of a year, during which the licence system still exist, while possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state that ensures appropriate access to marijuana approved and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius of a school, a park, a playground or a nursery). </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a cannabis sales registered trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis Centre, a research group recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the head of the police, Qates, AIMP, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the &quot;City&quot; (representing U.S. prosecutors) would pursue more people aged 21 and over who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop to charge people for this type of crime &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief Qates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the &quot;US&quot; (District Attorney of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to put pressure on users to make d√©sintoxiquer). </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are other indictments. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against these people who have committed a crime that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence,&quot; said Mr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the county&apos;s largest city, no longer appear to adults for possession of small quantities). </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the county prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but has also decided not to prosecute all cases of detention of marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t have the feeling of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, providing a legal framework and appropriate government marijuana personal consumption is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities reveal the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier&quot; with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption, which is expressed as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws &quot; (National Organization for the reform of laws on marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute those who used marijuana, however, they find it hard to accept that this is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to treat small marijuana consumption at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of sales legalised, they look with concern the federal guidelines, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of patients in medical marijuana and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed shops selling marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police will probably not take down the doors to capture small bags of drugs, it is likely that she is opposed to the licensed outlets for the sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Long before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for the sale of marijuana, even if it is only for one year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the city of Edenwold received a 6-month moratorium, and should impose the ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> A lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I have been bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not just the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother have studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of modern-day Greek theatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks after being installed in Worcester College in the late 80 s to study the history, I have decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and began to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper, The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in the cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I have fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I have fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and been the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name, or rather outrageous because I came from a private school). </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called know, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why am I talking about this today? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have called for protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Chamber of √©tudiants G-to-P examination of Corpus Christi College said they were &quot;often isolated, unwanted and felt personally attacked&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to have a representative in the university&apos;s Committee for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not helped by the recent documentary on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;The Euro-Wonderland: Young, intelligents and Right&quot;), dedicated to the policy among students, and painted &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentrics and neo-Nazis). </seg>
<seg id="2426"> We found it including the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University conservatrice &quot;Association (OUCA) ,&quot; who is in a silver Rolls-Royce, displaying a complete and moves with a cane to chrome head). </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, conservative students report being treated as scapegoats for the establishment of the increase in tuition fees. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the &quot;conservatrice Association&quot; Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing left-wing bias in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are as Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and Monica-Feb Cherill, 19 years, president of the OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the G-to-P against people who are from the centre-right). </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is an interruption of intellectual debates, as well as the welfare of members,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one who feels this way during my first weeks of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I am coming in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a crippling shyness). </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations). </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the earliest days of the week, when the host of new students have seen the other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what was going to happen next. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that teachers not only took part in the Tory sarcasm to students, but they were fun. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatisation and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved in wood from classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first, I encountered was a translation into English of the French 18th century, and I was not prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please bring the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I have lost its way. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man in the face subcircular, won easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Do the Thatch√©ristes refuse to learn English or are they just stupid?&quot; He asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students have laughed). </seg>
<seg id="2446"> It is enough to make me were burning. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you take French classes during your free time - well, if you are not too busy to make friends,&quot; he launched a truculent tone). </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I am back in my room, inconsolable). </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner that evening, I took my seat only then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a second year student of English studies, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA). </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said, nicely. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that it does. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Any person suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is taken. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour-speak). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I am faint-heartedly tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I did not agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The ploy failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken over the old story. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted,. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Tories do they love?&quot; Asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, isn&apos;t it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt as homosexuals before liberal legislation, s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> I have only been able to live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because it was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher&apos;s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this provincial place and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view marxiste-d√©terministe of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You are not happy here,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started commuting between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends in cities more open mind. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was refused to believe it. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the forties, all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best place in the world,&quot; he told me pathetically). </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not make it, not in the city of spires dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends Communists had ways beyond reproach. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in their eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> laisse-leur a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure this is for you fooling one another. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would break my heart if you leave Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a meeting of tutorials next week, when another history teacher suggested with the utmost seriousness, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Internally blushed with shame, I accepted to be a victim of brainwashing of my parents and traitai &quot;old crazy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> This is my father who drove the final nail in my coffin middle). </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was at in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I am never returned). </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can me a wimp She). </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no 18-year-old should be a victim of such intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a strong reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Teliszewsky prefers the elegance to the fame &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of designer Italian. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital fit to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani). </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer acknowledged at the opening of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; a prestigious retrospective which brings together more than 130 fashion models created for his fashion house in the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this building,&quot; he said with his inimitable emphasis. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;Signore&quot; Garavani, but who could have been written without its famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are a huge number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Teliszewsky exposes its personal memories as the trophies of his modest upward mobility: the designer of the city of Saj√≥iv√°nka, north of Italy, the idol of Riccioners. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong with love royalty .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least, they do not crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as some pop stars,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 60 s and 70 s, we were both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular and host receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We manducat all be invited in his cottage in Gstaad,&quot; explains the former wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, intimate friend and beauties of time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eug√©nie Niarchos). </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the reputation. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of clothing firm. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a parade in Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were two dozen people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, each guest felt important and appreciated,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; who began working with him during the week of the antique dealers in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;It will never be acceptable, because his creations are works of art,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of noble lineage </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but of love. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people of high and with more headlines and they love it too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour of sixty metres wide which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must go on the podium to admire a &quot;public&quot; dream for the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that was Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba). </seg>

<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a &quot;gillette&quot; jacket and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a gift that I had done,&quot; said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of clothing firm. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer to all the other for her femininity, her love of women, and because it sublime our beauty,&quot; adds the ex-duchesse, feriaper√∫). </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colors used, they are bright and shed light on his face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos;Arenberg can also forget the first time it has been a model Valentino). </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and was living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible in the late 90 s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard, Line). </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red evening dress, with a flying to skirt, a corsetery draped and beer gardens. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Recherche-action d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, it is obsessed with the timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess of Arenberga-Arembert-Aremberge-Aremburge retains the designer&apos;s evening dresses with &quot;the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all its memories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand final of the exhibition of Somerset House is married Marie-chantal Miller&apos;s dress during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the œÑhe designer and his seamstresses) to achieve this ivory silk dress with opercula beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a laggard of four metres. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of fashion at the end of the twentieth century, &quot;the return of customers of the high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the &quot;savoir-√™tre&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), CAVALIERE, commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani has as much credit as any spouse. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;Its sophistication, his calm, its perfect and I have always made very clear to me,&quot; acknowledges d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum d&apos;Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was perfect, the years have no effect on him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If this is a princess who said... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: human mules Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the Ecolabelled Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails). </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Amto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living with sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, in the east of the Indonesian island of Java). </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth is in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having collected large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installed in two in bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through steep trails). </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the treetops of the volcano, which peaked at 2.386 metres above sea level, but bondholders exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, crawling along, keeping the balance and measuring their not so as not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to his death in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, they find their way among tourists who photograph as if they were circus animals, and with heavy baskets, painfully, they walk the 3 kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below 1.850 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> These are PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, one might say, its employees, to whom she pays Indonesian 662 rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells at 10.000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry because the ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and being used to launder the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we move about 70 kilos, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Amto, which generally makes three trips a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> All it takes 3 hours and it ends up, but it allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it may seem to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would do in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; said the holder who once worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Amto came close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I selffunding Java to be converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Amto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In 27, he spent three years of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen but sulphur has already begun to pick up the bill although he covers his face with a mask and bears special gloves). </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Amto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French&quot; promet-t-il in English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this could be engaging and intelligent young tour guide, server or in a hotel receptionist, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares a pomatum unsafe wood with other carriers, rises each day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because the zero-sulphur never stops moving jaillir at night, when its characteristic becomes blue and yellow shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the dark, Amto descended into the crater of enlightenment, with a small lamp set at his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 Ecolabelled responsible sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not m√©canis√© sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to working on their own and are paid to the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In addition, they do not affect an under 30.000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase in camera, in addition to the entry of 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules human. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is being done to animals, not humans,&quot; Madrusin protest, carrying a stocky 42-year-old who works in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not stop to work &quot;as long as he can,&quot; because it needs money to raise its 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not going to take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the zero-sulphur damages the throat and eye irritation when the tide is turning and trapped the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer serious illnesses... Obviously added to their usual respiratory problems, pain, osteoarthritis in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets). </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only hold 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Each day, his companions and to extract 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three trucks carrying the Tamansari warehouse, 18 miles away by a goat path taken over by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I am not going to take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life,&quot; says Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several teeth missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as the bearer of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time is running out, but the misery from generation to generation perpetuates one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen). </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Sinapores lay the blame for the lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore must grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfilling our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for the mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as &quot;Words to open one in the drawer&quot; for mocking the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency responsible for the video, hope to draw attention to the problem of fun way thanks to the publicity. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to meet &quot;their national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the field in the birth rate, and we felt that it was a theme that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things as launch pheromone-baited perfumes or organize a speed-dating evenings). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative, but they may not have worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We are therefore said that what could be more creative in solving this problem than to a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore does not take more seriously. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends U.S. $1.300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers providing up to $15.000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes profits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a high-tech CityState rich and South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls). </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why didn&apos;t the Sinapores more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, policy director of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, said that it is due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the family,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These social changes have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delaying marriage and childbirth, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy to radically increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created a resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites that moves a thinly disguised xenophobia against immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of pushing wages down and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party up in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it started to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoebox,&quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale won a lot of success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, executive director of the real estate company EL GameFocus says that its &quot;shoes&quot; boxes to sell much more quickly than housing. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more quickly than those. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put a spanner in the works if they wanted to offer too small in a housing project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state). </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, through discussions with the Singapore who work in the financial district in the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people call it off,&quot; says a young framework. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,&quot; says another young of twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, it is the Sinapores themselves who have the final word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private is private offline online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary24, it is the quality of the private sector or in the field of private life that we can protect them from any intrusion. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> That est-ce-qui is a private matter for less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in daily life and social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Understand the dangers it presents by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he would certainly not offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeri√≥dico asked five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases, they have associated the word &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level and &quot;the password and user name&quot; when they have applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I&apos;m not my most personal secrets in a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term on private sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very secrets secret, my mother can know them but not everybody,&quot; he says). </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On the job, I Singstore images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also have to discuss it with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I do not share one of my photos or someone who would be stupid,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating comments or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on Belgian francs as well as its new subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they say, I simply position,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or friends, quickly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He said that he would never accept the request of a person unknown. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> It will not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits that he did not know 20 people on its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I don&apos;t worry because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, no one has made advances or asked his address or his phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I were the pressure or required, I simply delete my account,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jos√© has subscriber to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today as the online-against helped young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A friend of a friend of mine was extorted money on a social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jos√©, did not close his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;It has only happened in private profile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a series of manipulations to its account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do if I was angry or upset .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even if I know that this is the online-against,&quot; he says). </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a professor of English and dismissed in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet is emerging as a way to look for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras said that the euskaltzaina Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book &quot;digital immigrants,&quot; and inter-item uses these words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are the ones, children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, we are digital immigrants who need their teaching, while we ourselves are learning,&quot; she argues. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He added that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a definite attitude on what needs to be or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We also urge them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use the issues that are sobering. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so is useless,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you would not be telling to a stranger, why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, I like to publish a photo of you as a friend you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identifies holiday photos, about asking others permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone needs to know what you do at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do so out of line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> It is the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, an university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By understanding each of the words, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what they can to share or to publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration was made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE has tried several times to access the document signed at the sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency-in-Office reported initially that it would be disclosed after the close of the summit, and said that it would be published at any moment on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the APC1, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists &quot;access to information on the summit was always limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message &quot;audio, small private session&quot; was published in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among journalists have been given by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of Peruvian spokesman). </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, causing unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media for information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the Presidency-in-Office Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final statement&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was the host of the 3th summit of South American and Arab (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been urged by the press, it had not issued the statement also called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, you can verify that the document was published in March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international events, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the supply of information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also concluded with the agreement of both Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that settles a border between two different countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, gathered at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ&apos;s decision to hear the arguments of both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and would leave the verdict, which will resolve the disputes that we have today before the international court,&quot; said the President-inOffice Humala, along with its counterpart in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,&quot; said President Pi√±era by giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of two presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Covenant of Bogota by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered as seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay Unasur, suspended since 2011 after the ouster of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the policy of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries put in place &quot;important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that action would be taken to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and joint and effective way to assess the risks of natural disasters. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people,&quot; concluded the President-inOffice Humala). </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to focus on a group of 31 high-profile projects that improve the connection of South America, especially in rural areas and border... In between our country and in generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the Peruvian president during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and were on the lines of its territory, from the coast up in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give any further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document refers to the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the country&apos;s electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations, which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need that Latin America is a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another issue at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, according to Mexico City to discuss maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua who will seek to have a discussion with this country,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The Presidents-in-Office Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they are due to attend the takeover of the country&apos;s new president, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers will meet prior to approving the Action Plan of 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru holds the presidency of the regional bloc .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America and Europe must learn how to integrate a citizenship,&quot; says Rafael Correa). </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which &quot;South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans &quot;were killed during the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but they were now almost a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur). </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American countries, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there is still a reactionary areas that we want to be a thing of the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, the president of Ecuador has shown for the restoration of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who have bombarded us do nothing to undermine China-unlike, South American, we have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington in the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because it has not betrayed its principles, but it has met its &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that &quot;there was a suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, he criticizes Swedish justice who demanded that he submit its territory to questioning about an alleged sexual offence while &quot;the Swedish legislation makes it possible to do so by video conference, which could be done for the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,&quot; said Ecuador&apos;s president). </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being locked up in a small area without being able to exercise. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This is about the health of anyone,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, based in Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and it stresses that there have been discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garz√≥n, has launched a series of procedures to various European institutions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he believes that &quot;if Britain gave the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as is entirely its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or asked via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa has taken the opportunity to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that it was &quot;not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that are harmful to the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, it welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists &quot;the bankers and bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than to highlight his re-election, &quot;it would increase the revolution to continue the path and draw the right track.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency &quot;must stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted disguised coup,&quot; because in reality, &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries through the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American countries). </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They need to be addressed as a whole to overtake them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he said that he was confident in the proper resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said he is &quot;beneficial that Latin America seize international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment if it is strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if he lost the primaries in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I was never interested in power, but in situations that are as unfair as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed the eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last term and then I will withdraw from politics. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will do so as well. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch√°vez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicol√°s Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This is not a relapse of the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented on. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The deaths from AIDS are now due to a detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: HIV-positive). </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen on me,&quot; he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make them &quot;less painful,&quot; to no avail. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man had hidden in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take care of his illness and began to seek information about him and his determination was such that it recently celebrated her 43th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something that is difficult to imagine in the early 90 s, where there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma too. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to say hello to him &quot;because he was speechless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their illness, many people are still where the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections). </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, &quot;the great victory is now that the survival of a patient who started a timely treatment and survival of the population in general is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of HCG-treated, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication). </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of the immune system that showed patients at diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a Schonheyder rates of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years, &quot;as long as he is under control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; said the scientist questioned. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To put this in context, it should be noted that Mexican life expectancy is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that the mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients identified on the basis of national data are dead. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Nothing to Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths so far in May of this year; however, we are assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why is there still death? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we have never failed to drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or when they learn to advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us a clearly-demarcated &quot;nine out of ten patients arrive when they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is deliver earlier diagnoses and for that we have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who request it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the Council of State AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has had to its screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his youth, he was already holder of AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer is one of the complications common. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think they are going to die and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I&apos;m going to die, it is better that I broke three times a week,&quot; they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was beneficial, I eat well, exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents know only that he is suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am responsible, attention to me and to the other person,&quot; says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with the JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, at the foot of the World Day against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon if they are infected and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they should know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who have embraced the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places dedicated to it, &quot;it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now it gives us a hundred packages, it is all very well, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms,&quot; he says). </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections include adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Asked with nothing but scorn and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don&apos;t want to hear, ensures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold in the shops, but they can be found in public toilets and distributors in the places frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This is not to encourage the crowd problems. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not only about their pay girls and Tour-Motel, as had the Governor Emilio Gonz√°lez replied when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This is not how it works sexuality, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 cases of AIDS combined (12.158 and 1.317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is the 4th state of the country in number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of those infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are sexually transmitted through the blood, 6% and 2% by road. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50.000 people living with HIV, as recorded in each case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> In a judgment call by an United States court ignores the debt restructuring of the Battelle-Columbus granted via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. Baldi√±a creates a dangerous precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and with problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> So it looks like the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the star-spangled banner, opposite view of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Mexican companies left defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge of the case said that creditors must register under U.S. bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of insolvency of companies with a profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformit√© Commercial International Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote internal-company, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, with debts of Battelle-Columbus subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of NTWG, had guaranteed the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, in every way Battelle-Columbus&apos; creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot and Liverpool International Limited, would not get the necessary majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote was 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A fact omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Battelle-Columbus was blamed for the difficult situation that he met since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, passing the costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For now, the family company Gonz√°les Sada file an appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote to be taken in its entirety, that is, with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance will call for the non-prosp√©rit√© and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The worst problem is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae (friend of the Court &quot;), which detailed the procedure followed by Battelle-Columbus as part of the bankruptcy law, noting that the free trade agreements signed by the two countries to the same level as paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, he said that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, to ensure fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile-up of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and overwhelm the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> Overall picture </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of trade unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against head of society, Gast√≥n Azc√°rraga Andrade, were overlooked for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Mid-St Aviateurs employmenton has already met with problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The body, headed by Carlos D√≠az Ch√°vez Morineau, has just presented a criminal claim against the National Banking Commission and Values who is accused of obstructing justice. </seg>

<seg id="2854"> They besiege the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> At the end of the week in a lecture theatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, university professors, businessmen and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country&apos;s products from the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> ACTA is dead </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government has put forward a requirement in the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions of Mexico&apos;s ambassador to Japan had signed the Agreement Data Protection Supervisor, known by its French acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute IPR-III, this theme is already history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As everyone knows, this was done while the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes &quot;The basketball is all my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotting of basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, through him, has traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a stroke was condemning the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player and lower leagues, basketball national team player, manager and leader of the national team, the KNSO, with Vaqueros, Bayam√≥n or as chairman of the federation of baseball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have brought several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time, as when I was chairman of KNSO, director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 90 s,&quot; recalls Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora home to Bayam√≥n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;The basketball is my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes not exaggerating when he made that statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all equipated photos and memories that recall its non-standard route. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all his memories, he loves the most are those who recall his visit as a player in the team of Vaqueros in the mid-50 s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, I have benefited most because I had the chance to participate in eight of Vaqueros championships from 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> This is a great deal of satisfaction, including five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy came in the team of the NSO. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot;FQSA&quot; Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a strapping player for you, it measures two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> That is the way to begin Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow told me then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of the best shooters). </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He was pleased to Vaqueros with Gausse championship, but only at a distance because in 1988 it was already the czar of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States in the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if the Canadian judge had not made us play the last match, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The World&apos;s team of 1990 national team is the best that you have to? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my preference is for the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have put a kicking in the United States team, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World Cup). </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and &quot;Picul√≠n&quot; (Ortiz), there were also young (Javier) &quot;To√±ito&quot; Col√≥n and James Carter, the brothers Le√≥n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to attend the 90 Global due to a problem of knees. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that might not be the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the thermalism pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner instead of players suspended by the mess in the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the promises. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Undoubtedly, this is Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Picul√≠n). </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> That was the best leader Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres). </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In young people, I love the work that is Leo Arill). </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> It is part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990 s, KNSO had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> You remains to be done? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I wanted to put in place, as re-regionalisation of categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that boys behave play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the play-offs nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people travel and play too while it is not necessarily required. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least given the benefit of mandatory qualifications and courses for leaders, field staff and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look am time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games). </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I would like to take the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been to me. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, at Forth Worth, Texas, became internationally known by the prominence of John Ross Ewing, better known as the Alongi-Peluso, in the television series &quot;Dallas,&quot; in which he was a businessman, and unscrupulous manipulator. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role as a ruthless oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of the greed in the 1980 s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who came back this year in the role of J.R in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros. Production, home of &quot;Dallas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role ironic that he loved the most,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Larry&apos;s family and close friends were with him to Dallas in this holiday after Thanksgiving). </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the aftermath, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane). </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him). </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it will greatly miss). </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional person and he lived life to the bottom,&quot; said Gray in a communiqu√©. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he admitted many lowcalorie for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he had undergone a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman had announced on television in the role of a regular type in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he found a seductive engineering, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He also played in two comedy that have remained little time on air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his film roles are well received by the critical roles in &quot;The Group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was through his masterful interpretation of deliciously detestable Alongi-Peluso that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The CBS dramatic series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast on April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who shot J.R.?,&quot; invented to maintain the suspense around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Cespitosa is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in bets. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> As a result, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers averaged before their screen and have made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most watched entertainment programme in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., ceduto (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had taken over. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> Alongi-Peluso had been pregnant and had then threatened the accused of prostitution if it does not leave the city, but others also had reason to be assaulted. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable human but charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to place his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what should be the epitaph for,&quot; said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> We should write: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here are the only party to be regained. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, who co-hosted the original series, has called this Friday to Cespitosa as a &quot;huge, both on the small screen as in life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The registration of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is under way, informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For now, neither Warner nor the chain TNT have communicated on the way in which will be integrated into the death of Cespitosa in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who ran into fame with classic works such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him in 1931 when she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman). </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He is taking its first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950 s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> That is where he met the young Swedish Ch√¢teau Maj Axelsson and married). </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the California city and Malibu, where many celebrities). </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he called his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin&quot;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life &quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&quot;: The ruthless memoirs, J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I have nothing in writing this book that can injure someone or affect in any way,&quot; he told the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active campaigner of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients worried. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advise, I trust, I come back with them when they come to be operated on and after,&quot; he said in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to give them a little comfort, such as &quot;Do not be afraid, that will not be easy for a while now, but it will go well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course on the &quot;End of the world&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the o.o, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the religious teacher Stuart Charm√© decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew he was an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;great count&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, in which many people refer to as proof of the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor Charm√© had no idea of what is expected in the coming months: Hurricane Sandy, a catastrophic fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the &quot;Armageddon&quot; debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, where Christian theorists of the late time thought to trigger the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I had not realised that this was going to be the most apocalyptic half that I have ever seen,&quot; said Professor Charm√© this week to its students from the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we are getting, it was a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it is important to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only teacher to teach about the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> To Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the &quot;Media, Culture and end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the o.o, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We are analysing this because these ideas grow over time,&quot; he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some conduct human. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students will analyse films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; said Vacker). </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, Professor of History of Latin America, and his colleague Matthew Amara Solari, an Assistant professor of History of Art and anthropologie, were to give the team, simply entitled &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add&quot; 2012 &quot;to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not go,&quot; said Professor Restall). </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;looming disaster,&quot; students must study, creating projects and taking their exams at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student to work &quot;until the night of the supposed end of the world,&quot; said Restall). </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses have proved quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was complete in two hours,&quot; said Restall about its course for high-level students, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there were still in place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people can do to comfort herself,&quot; says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden). </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether religious or secular, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychologie and of 25 years, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films). </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this matter,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I like it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the doomsday date of 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,&quot; says Julie zegle, final-year student to Temple, a 21-year-old from West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is just a key date on the calendar, said Restall). </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I admit that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has led to a boom in such speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other parts of the world, people don&apos;t think about it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The majority of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University La Salle who gives way to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that by courses on &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world,&quot; -and-something replied, as if it were an exception from the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall pointed out that over the years, there has been talk of the many alleged dates of last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, &quot;people will immediately begin to think about the next date&quot; or to philosophize on the fact that the 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers take the date lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several have told us they thought go to parties &quot;to the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Sometimes, I called friends and exciting to be together,&quot; said Samira Ford, communications student of 20 years. </seg>
