<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans to justify its policy of the need to fight against falsification of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the Center of Brennan&apos;s consider the last myth, claiming that the cases of falsifications of the elections in the United States, more rare than deaths from lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides, the lawyers of the Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense such actions partially discredited the American system of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American States are responsible for organizing Federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most of the state governments since 2009, to adopt laws, which complicate the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained new momentum after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new places in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only for one year 2011 was adopted 180 draft laws, which restrict the right to vote in 41 States. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New laws on elections require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, remove the right of registration of the voter in the day of the expression of will and take away the right to vote from the citizens, who have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to the 2006 elections, no one American state is not required voters to present photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state, who made such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The U.S. Supreme court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the past two years, they initiated draft laws requiring voters to present photo identification, in 34 States. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity card, as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is 21 million people, have reached the age required for voting age, do not have an ID with a photograph, issued by a governmental authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required identity cards often exceed one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years old do not have the required identity document with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students of voters, which are believed to vote for the candidates of the Democrats, in several States are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same States allow members of the fishing and hunting club, which vote mainly for the Republicans, used for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no state is not required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Starting from 2011, more than ten States have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures is clearly designed to restrict the voting immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two-thirds of the Latin American voters voted in favor of the Democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, упраздняющие the registration of voters on the day of voting in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction were not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make the lists of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, measures taken, starting from 2009, led to the fall by 17% of the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition Republican legislators have taken in the five other States of laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 General election, in Florida 33% of the voters, who voted ahead of schedule, were African-Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of the voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens, who voted ahead of schedule. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike whites, who, forming 76% of voters, people who voted ahead of schedule was only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws were ветировано governors of the Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The action of the most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the Prosecutor General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of the 34 States have passed laws requiring their identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules have entered into force, of course, hinder the implementation of the electoral law on the elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been passed, seeing in them a clear direction on what to influence the results of elections in 2012 in the key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Report of the centre Brennan from 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws are 171 out of 270 votes needed in the electoral College, to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to assert with confidence, that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense such actions partially discredited the American system of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening of prostate cancer: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test for the DOG gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so are reluctant to undergo medical examinations, we have something to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Take an HIV test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We ask the opinion of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data are difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European found different levels of mortality for those patients, who underwent screening, and those who did not take place. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also found that after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40% higher than in those who did not pass screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting from 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men of African-American origin are also at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer is found. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The cancer may be as aggressive and indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to clarify the degree of the risk of cancer, offering him a possible options, without obligatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not dangerous for life in the long term, and making the choice in these cases, in favor of active disease surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who have identified the cancer will not pass the course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will they offer the active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we start the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, we accuracy define the criteria for making a decision on who should or should not pass a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Association of urology, Мовембер created a tool to evaluate all the pros and cons of passing the test at the DOG. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (so far in English, translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent illness </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is considered, that if all the people are great to eat and enough moved, 30% of cases Raco could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one smoked, this figure would have risen to at least 50%&quot;, - stressed Andre Beaulieu, the press-Secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, an estimated 10% of cases of cancer is caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain a totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against Smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It causes tremendous harm to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers&quot;, - says the press-Secretary of Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The encouraging fact: after 10 years after quitting your risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the data of the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of occurrence of a cancer of a mammary gland, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervix. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Studies show that regular physical activity throughout the life protects against colon cancer&quot;, - added in the Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Power </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Association also recommends limiting the intake of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancers of the colon. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Should be avoided also sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Preservation of meat by Smoking, drying or pickling, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;Last may cause harm to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer&quot;, - explain in the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many of the scientists involved in the study of the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be described as mixed. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, the study of vitamin E provide conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed decrease the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In the assessment of the influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also, there is no complete clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and family history it is important to discuss with the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Surrender of analysis does not lead to cancer. </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson is in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer a message that scientists might have been able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that the boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, neither more nor less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the last particle, whose existence was predicted in the framework of the Standard model - our best, or, in any case, &quot;the least imperfect&quot; description of the nature and behavior of matter, but which had not previously been found empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physicists still not completely sure, that this is just about бозоне Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is really a new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented at this week for a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although to be sure, some of the data is still lacking. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same, that we are talking about бозоне Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem to be minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world one law is absolutely inevitable, says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule, there is no possibility, don&apos;t even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although the physics of elementary particles is rather a strange world, it turns out, that in it also there is a law of this nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that the two particles may not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in one and the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - is &quot;condition&quot; is, in General terms, some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Proceeding from this, the share of physics of the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, which wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In the other, the bustling bosons, villainous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> As informs a site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, of which we here will not speak, and &quot;particle forces&quot;, by means of which are covered by the fundamental forces of nature and to which in some way concerns the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Most of these bosons, it should be stressed that not all of these exotic creatures, as you would think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot;, which is the &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle that has an electric charge, is accelerated or changes direction, it &quot;breaks&quot; the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violation&quot; is born electromagnetic wave (light or infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is no more than a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons &quot;vectors of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, the only difference is that, in order to this boson appeared, should be &quot;disturbed&quot; another field, Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to arouse him, the need to reach a very high energies, as if it were on a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake just a big rock. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That&apos;s why need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that is operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for an explanation of the relationship between the Higgs boson and ground. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all the particles and not all of the material interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, interact, and others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not stick on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have the mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;can bring&quot; all of these studies, says Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the discrepancy between the results of observations and forecasts CM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> In addition, some of them passionately crave to such a discrepancy is found, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some of the holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Last, you need to say, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (Oh!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the Universe (uh-Oh!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN of such differences was not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The consequences of </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from the research to the daily life of the average person difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: in the beginning of 60-ies of the pioneers of laser research in the laboratories of the Bella could not even imagine, what kind of revolution triggered by their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Laboratories of the bell, which in 1960 was invented by a laser, and which itself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulse) in 1962, said that, initially, the laser was considered more as a &quot;laboratory gadget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And in addition, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optical researches in 1969, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it wasn&apos;t his original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel prize in physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;Duty&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> In the Commission for a worthy death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will soon be resumed, and in this time of preparing the bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless, in this crucial area, much still remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; tried to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Yet he lived alone in his apartment in Монтережи. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Cancer of the prostate, разрушавший it from the inside, gave him a respite for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years, I have lived seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-Гадбуа in Whiter, where I arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, for it is impossible to prepare&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job: the incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even feed themselves independently. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table, on which stands a delicious lunch, he gives in and agrees to be helped to take the food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He braces, even manages to smile, talk to strangers, who are working around him, bring him medicine, and lead him into the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest desire that cured me from diarrhoea, this is humiliating,&quot; - he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of life we are taught that a man must urinate standing up,&quot; says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the shelter Victor-Гадбуа. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the state of a child for some unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on a person&apos;s ability to&quot; redress the decline, &quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people, involved in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who enroll in palliative shelter Victor-Гадбуа, all of the sick with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts assign them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses did not provide more assistance, called &quot;medical&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years old, most of all afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to learn of their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I I want nothing more in life,&quot; she says, before we allow to put her mask, facilitates breath. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting in the next few days last visit his son, who had come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the shelter of the Victor-Гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which is, when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec in every 11 700 residents there is one place in the premises of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, considering that sooner or later we&apos;re all going to die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martell - one of the doctors of the shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it&apos;s the comfort of a physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we would agree to provide mouth-rinsing of brandy or Pepsi, it depends on what he asks for. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics we do not have to control the level of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought the beer Mr. X., who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son drank a beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are helping to close, as well as patients,&quot; says Natalie saver, Director of the care of the sick. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the shelter of the Victor-Гадбуа no day is like the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Close to the 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on his cushions during the toast in his honor, tragically dies young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and перепробоваший all, in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the past six months of three to five beds, are always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; anxiously says Dr. Christian Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-Гадбуа, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77% of Canadians just don&apos;t have access to palliative care, that is, to care, which is provided to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-Гадбуа and Society of palliative care in the home of a Large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This large gap in the health system Quebec makes many physicians - specialists in palliative care beware of the adoption of the law, легализирующего euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Starting from October circulates Manifesto, signed by the luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Балфуром Маунтом and Dr. Bernard Ляпуантом and witnesses about their disagreement with this initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system Quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before it is allowed to transfer euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, &quot; she says, &quot; I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ensure that they facilitate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I&apos;m afraid that patients who wish to die just because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hope for the survival of Helen Richard have already been minimal, when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied to me that he was sorry, that I stop fighting, &quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="201"> At that, she told herself, that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> The omnipotent care no </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, to thank the medical staff, because they have not fulfilled their request, after the team for palliative care eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monroe, Director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care in the home of a Large Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> In the end-of-life doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients, suffering from pain, always say one and the same phrase: &quot;I want to die&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you, I had euthanasia&quot;, it means &quot;I want to make me feel better&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible thanks to journalistic grant from the Institute of health research in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials, responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of funds of political parties and experts in the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous &quot;system&quot;, covering the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;The industry&quot;, which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious, how loose this system, after you have put into it all means, joking Jacques Дюшено, the Deputy and the former chief of police of Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Thanks to him, in 2011 the scandal erupted as a side result of the investigation of official crimes, connected with road-construction contracts in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of that time from the liberals, Jean Charest, agreed reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Report of the Дюшено&quot; made a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Ministry of transport would save billions of dollars in contracts,&quot; if some concealed his instincts to take part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Шарбонно &quot;already moved two mayors,&quot; he adds, hoping that she will be able to &quot;open circuit, standing for individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Permanent division on struggle against corruption created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> To the case of connected created in 2011 Permanent unit for the fight against corruption, in which structure entered extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, the employees of the special division &quot;Hammer&quot;, which after 2009 was forced to &quot;drain the cartel&quot; of Montreal, to stop the overestimation of the value of the contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, was made a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the Franc Зампино and Richard Маркотту - the mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> In the queue - Gilles Вайянкур, a recently retired from the post of the mayor of Laval, the third biggest city in the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of the repeated charges of accepting bribes when placing state orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, formal charges were brought against several engineers service of transport of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Аккурсо and Lino Замбито. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last blew up a real bomb, told the investigators about the &quot;system&quot; of receiving government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> In several years Замбито gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal, a mediator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, translated the money of the party of the mayor of Жеральда Tremblay &quot;joint Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000s Замбито wasted money right and left. He listed more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euro) various parties of the province, mostly liberals, who was then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that he illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal party Natalie Нормандо. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewerage contracts, in which inflated the cost of </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal &quot;system&quot; corruption worked flawlessly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Сюрпренан, a former engineer for civil construction, in detail described her before the Commission: in the ten years he had received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, Golf tournaments, in restaurants, at the matches of the ice hockey and bribes to a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that they received on the paw, overstating account for 30-40% with the help of false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer of the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay in the fact that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, filled the party coffers dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal in deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Руло was one of the first deputies in Montreal, beating the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of the district of Riviere-de-Прэри in the East of the island, it opposes in 2010, the sale of the municipal area, which was bought for $ 5 million and перепроданного for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be started, she &quot;pull the string, which allows to understand the functioning of the system, patrolled by the ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process she характерезует as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but the Montreal will need its own investigation team and the observer, in order to avoid the return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we get out of the house. </seg>
<seg id="244"> On a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Дюшено sees with his hand, that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but most especially it concerned the role of the &quot;elected officials who knew about this scheme&quot;, but is not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Taking into account that the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: &quot;I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec offers a limit of up to $ 100 donations to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: &quot;While we won&apos;t be strictly confined to election expenses in politics are dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete rebuild of the system of state contracts and the financing of political parties: &quot;We can&apos;t fall below; boldly penetrating into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a firmer Foundation, with better control and the rule of law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Дюшено appeals to those, who laughs, look in your own backyard ... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG - not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season you in Wolfsburg have made extraordinary proportions. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but can - and a new measurement of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profit of great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I&apos;m growing every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also brought so many things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors are driving me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t распаляюсь. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the very beginning in the center of preliminary training in the NIF in Клерфонтене and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always walked forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from the competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Replenishment of the summer are not new to play matches of a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that such a player, like me, eager to be on the level and posted to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Help him such deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti - the master of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the First League he has no equal and it is included into number of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think, it will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was encouraging conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I moved away from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Trust me he has also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season, PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the First League of Lyon took the place of the leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the UEFA Champions League: we effectively be classified in one eighth of the finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as you can. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We can say his word face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all we want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, in order to be able to take a second match in the Octafinal. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether PSG be the first-class European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He had to do this already have a budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris necessary to win titles and consolidate its position in the long-term perspective. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today this is not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially the PSG have the means to make this project real. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the First League, as in the last season will be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we have a real hot we wish to get the champion&apos;s title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to this. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In may, was a disappointment, because we have everything to come to the finish line first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We ended up with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think, everything will be in order. </seg>
<seg id="302"> In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title entered such a strong team like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the power to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Don&apos;t You think that the mass media are waiting for too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, considering how much was invested and what we have players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are completely ready for it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we are at home win 4-0 against Trois and we still find for that attack, of course, it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We ask ourselves the question, why in the first place expect from us the people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We do not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to implement the project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proved in the Champions League, that can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United FC, who is already two of the season cannot be one-eighth finals, although they, too, have spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the invested amount, we you were 15 points ahead already the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would disregard for our opponents and to the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which have not been at the height of last season, had been &quot;awakened&quot; this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how interesting the First League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say to himself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we have won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG, it seems, depends entirely on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Well, and what if they say that there is a &quot;Златанозависимость&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to do this, and he proves that he&apos;s the star of the First League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star of world scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we are his respect as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done, it is really only. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and other improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have experienced the Euro-2012 with the national team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I wished to participate in the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a bit of playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen a lot of things, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I managed to play a good qualifying matches . </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is something that I was hoping since my baptism of the Blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must act in an exemplary manner. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do You think about the first months of Didier Дешама in Chapter Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They are effective. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the qualifying group for the world Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He strict coach, it is close to the players and inspiration to victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not like to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached its goal, he described us in Euros. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will cause the Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Good deserved a draw (1-1), torn October 16 in Spain - it&apos;s a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match gave us faith in yourself. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> To this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of banks with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the current money exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between the receiving party c fees for processing them. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, it is obvious political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Накамото (pseudonym), simultaneously is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, Euro ...) and secure communication Protocol according to the type of BitTorrent, which makes it possible to exchange files between members of the same level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousands of web sites take биткойны for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Course биткойна, peaking at $ 30 (23 euros) in June, 2011. five months later fell to $ 2, before returning today to about ten dollars (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on a virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes биткойн as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the Euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies as the &quot;loans&quot; are used for the promotion of in a video game, which is earned in the game process or of which it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But exchange operations always monitors and handles any Central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In Биткойн all nodes of the network at the same time are holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers of currency, покупателыми and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> The functioning of this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users really going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for every new payment the user can select a different address, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information relating to the transaction, shall be signed electronically, using the encryption system with double-key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Due to the content of a file, you can verify that the биткойны used in a transaction, there are indeed in the public accounting book, sent across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is the registration of the new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem, a kind of computers, decided that, if the temporary Central Bank has the privilege to add the new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about the phase of the hash file, then there is a conversion of a large file in a digital signature short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take the&quot; a new transaction and add her number before the &quot;hashed&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (lots of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found, the other nodes easy to check that it is correct. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction are thus нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification of a change digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If for the purpose of deceiving the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) would have to pay two times by one and the topic of same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would have remained unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has decided to task gets 50 биткойнов. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the award regularly divided into two halves, probably until the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of биткойнов in circulation, therefore, is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one стомиллионной, which leaves a reserve of... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task is also increasing with the increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has survived the UPS and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites, service providers Will have been subjected to attack, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;Using the defect is not to the Protocol,&quot; said Pierre Нуаза, which recently launched a Paymium - the company which is carrying out the payments real money with the use of Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB has also informed about the possibility of money laundering through this that anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash money also have this disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Still others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their permit. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, reviewed the books of account and found that almost 80% of биткойнов are in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Giant sales&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged&quot;, rejoices Jon Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which is involved in the conversion of биткойнов in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Нуаза, the other is the author of manuals on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify the transaction, which thus comes out cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner of better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install a new device or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough just to inform address, which can be &quot;photograph and recognize&quot; the telephone, said Pierre Нуаза, assuring that he has already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a General trend revision of hierarchical systems in favour of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;First of what Will be established, it will take some time, but the year 2013 can be a turning point&quot;, - he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to revise a variety of risks that are considered today increased, in case of success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We had left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Суроби). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans have to follow them to the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army now is the time to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their own future, not relying only on us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> From the us suffered mainly Afghan peasants, which we considered as terrorists . </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and injured. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders who are hiding in Pakistan, but also often from the peasants, who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the USSR. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, the old and archaic, even to join them jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They suffer, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will be no more, as soon as the West will behave in a more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Withdrawal of French troops from the base Ниджраб, which I watched from the height of the hills planted with almond trees by the French loans, passed in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, not being атакованными. </seg>
<seg id="411"> With the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not . </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since the time of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time of Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of release, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women paid for obscurantism of the peasants, where they exceeded al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and in our days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban United in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war, returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become the dealers, capturing the state of the earth, to resell them for construction of the repatriates, who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using the huge American subcontracting contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited; the majority of them, by the way, even were not at war. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in rural areas, want the government, which would consist not of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, how to make those who managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and of its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world during the time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in the cities filled, both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who do not wish to return or to the obscurantism of the old parties, nor the corruption of a few leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and that look everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Currently the army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities, who will be in charge, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The old commanders, had anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures for the restoration of the provincial armed forces who would not obey the Central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent decentralised, on the model of Western countries, but the United States would like to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which existed from the times of the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want to foreign control, in particular before the elections, scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country, starting with the 50-ies, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industry was not brought to his feet, none of the dam is not functioning, none of the irrigation system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> All imported; produces nothing, but vegetables and fruit. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by the thirty years war, the state control over the infrastructure would be required. </seg>
<seg id="438"> There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to possess them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transport to their export through the mountains, there is no production of mineral resources. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost gone copper field of Months Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the world Bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province. </seg>

<seg id="452"> This is a new risky step of the President Mohammed Mursi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the question of constitutional Declaration, which temporarily give him emergency powers, he decided to play VA-Bank. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Catching everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Exactly a week ago the head of state gave an Assembly of two additional months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Soon the two years, as Egypt is based on the draft text, which has been amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> According to his opponents, the President persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing to &quot;disturb the word&quot; and &quot;shall tread down the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In the camp of his followers sure that this is the way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> The referendum shall be held within fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text, article after article. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Морси, seems convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he stated in an interview to the American weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Or you vote for my text, or I leave himself emergency powers&quot;, which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part Islamists, voted yesterday for the text. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals did not respond to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional Declaration, they slammed the door, feeling not in a position to convey his opinions. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> To the quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Brothers of Moslems. </seg>
<seg id="471"> It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few differences day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the Committee considered that the clock of the Constituent Assembly has not been properly configured. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, according to which only yesterday was a vote, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The object of everyone&apos;s attention, article 2 of the ultimately remained identical to the article of the Constitution of 1971, which States that &quot;the principles of the Sharia is the main source of law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the major requirements hoped to replace the &quot;principles&quot; of the &quot;rules&quot;that would allow them more strict application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, is an indication of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot; - with the liberals who see this as the only PR. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They point in particular to article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar Advisory role, in particular as regards verification of conformity of laws of the Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to a specialist in Egypt Sophie Помье, this is alarming because the &quot;people, called to make decisions, not elected, and have no democratic legitimacy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="481"> We can observe the birth of a theocracy&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="486"> But he acknowledges that &quot;around article 220 can be ambiguous, as used in it terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> This applies in particular to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, - Prim ed.]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And in the future, the question may arise as far as civilian judges are competent to make decisions about it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticised, because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Muslim brothers &apos; claim that they were considerably reduced in comparison with those which were under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another moot point: the powers of the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will take place not in the Parliament, and the National Council of defence. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Also would not be prohibited trial of civilians in military courts, in spite of the request of associations for the protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider harmful to freedom. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now banned insult, which can have serious implications for the freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition, none of the articles does not speak about the protection of women, stresses Heba Мораеф, of human rights watch. </seg>

<seg id="601"> Initiative on introduction of testing was supported by the deputies of the state Duma, and the Federal migration service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask in a press question: what is, in fact, give us? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will be bound by the knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the visitors? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, meet the representatives of the migration service, - it will reduce the number of people suffering from the &quot;labour servitude&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Very many people now talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Себелев. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of their rights should begin prior to their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organized recruitment will allow to 90% solve the problem of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problem arises among migrant workers no profession, education, not knowing the language, do not have a medical examination. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, &quot; I&apos;m sure Себелев - the next migrant doomed to deal with unscrupulous people, who under the guise of assistance thrust is complete his &quot;ticket&quot; in a cramped barracks where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, and hammer for 12-14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, come to work in Russia, recognized that not only do not know the language of the country in which aspire to, but also on their own-then write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it is not so much their fault, how much trouble a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a smart primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Because their families have nothing to even feed the children, not to mention the fact that decent their dress, shoes and equip the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> To grow up to teenage age, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, &quot; they say. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;Feel humbled and deeply flawed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, in regard to the act on the language of human rights defenders note one important moment. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Testing will be carried out only to those migrants who have legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If the status is not - there will be no exam or subsequent official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, most of the guest workers are still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome, or no trespassing&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many of them claim that receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is that the bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization of the costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And that&apos;s a false registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Staff members of the Russian police know that we have basically false documents, no registration, hence, cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Asking a hundred, two hundred cigarettes, tea&quot;, - has shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Хушкадамов. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Fly, don&apos;t be miserly, buy paintings&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> In the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it turned out that false are not only migrant documents for registration. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;bogus&quot; certificates about passing the language test has already seized by the FMS. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Fake paper printed on normal color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, they got new owners not free: each of migrants who are thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It in two with superfluous time more expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost migrant workers in three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="636"> In fact, that the main task for the nearest future is to protect the system against corruption, in order to &quot;peel&quot; it was impossible to simply buy converge and representatives of the authorities and human rights activists. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Meanwhile, the authorities can promise guest workers, not been able to successfully pass a test the first time, the time to study the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, visitors who do not know Russian, you will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people. </seg>

<seg id="644"> The idea has supported the head of the Duma Committee on security and countering of corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will contribute to the state Duma in the near future. </seg>

<seg id="663"> Their contribution, according to Баранца, make weapons manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now breed private arms factories, which are not competitive on the international market and throw away the weapon from under the floor on the black market, including Moscow,&quot; the expert says. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Another source of &quot;black&quot; market - smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Especially a lot of acts of pistols and machine guns from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is own production, sometimes Handicrafts, and formed a mob, which organised the stream&quot;, &quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts considered, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> The report of that in 2011 the Center for problem analysis and state-administrative planning. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Specialists analysed the statements of the Ministry of internal Affairs and Federal state statistic service, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons issues. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapons, write the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of all weapons on the black market out there &quot;through the fault of the officials, whose work is connected with the weapon,&quot; the report says. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to researchers, 17% of the cases the weapon comes from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of the production of nuclear weapons, 5% goes to the &quot;black archeology&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Seller-consultant of one of gun shops, who asked not to name him, assures, that the weapon was found black diggers, already long ago no one buys - too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go on a military warehouse. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Through the ensign&apos;s a person buys a unit, for example a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> He discharged it, pass through the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;He carries her to the city and here sell for 900 euros each with two shops&quot;, - he says </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;However, the police in the course of all cases, therefore periodically when the lamp is lit plan for the detection of crimes, conducts the test purchase from merchants illegal weapons,&quot; says the consultant. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxurious shop&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer often find each other through friends. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I looked on web sites, blogs, so far not responded friend, who offered to come to the platform &quot;Begovaya&quot;, where will be the man who would take me in a &quot;corner&quot;, where we will be traded. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the barrel I only found out there </seg>
<seg id="685"> military commentator Viktor Баранец </seg>
<seg id="686"> To get the trunk I need a friend, who is a way out, &quot; says the seller-consultant. &quot;I have a friend there, but I&apos;m in it I am not sure. </seg>
<seg id="687"> Sellers at the markets there are, but there, too, you need to come, say, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell, that the daughter of a tooth fell out of it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> I now even a couple of knuckles get through a man in whom I am sure. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He also their supplies only me, because he knows that I did not rent. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Newcomers searching for weapons of different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> A former military Victor Баранец tried himself in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about this. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The scheme, according to him, has not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given an album with the photos, where it was &quot;anything goes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I feel like in a luxurious shop&quot;, - says the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to Баранца, do not offer a cat in a bag &quot; all you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, a potential client, not just buy a &quot; we&apos;re going with the seller in the forest, where we put the target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They give me a chance to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapons beats well, begin to bargain&quot;, - describes the procedure for the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shop on the couch </seg>
<seg id="699"> Search engines on the Internet lead to the sites and the group in the &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, where the offer to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> It does not require any documents and personal meetings. </seg>

<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, send a photo and a step where the hidden weapon&quot;, - says the press-Secretary of the public organization &quot;Law on weapon&quot; Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Баранец claims that leaving the application form on the site, you can go without weapons and go to jail. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal security service is now разбросила a huge network of fake web sites and want to buy weapons rows with a shovel. </seg>

<seg id="716"> Makarov for $ 100 </seg>
<seg id="717"> When buying illegal small arms, according to estimates of experts, we can meet in the amount of from 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization &quot;Law on weapon&quot;, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars. </seg>

<seg id="721"> According to the official стастистике agencies, in comparison with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the United States are on strike the workers of fast food and supermarket chains </seg>
<seg id="723"> Through the work on the vault of the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; is held up to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the Department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger king, Taco bell, &quot;Уэндис&quot; and &quot;Kentucky fried chicken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one can predict, will become whether this surge in the ninth shaft or she is destined to become stale in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares of support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to enhancing the modest salaries, which are ordinary workers Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the establishment of trade Union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> While this sector of the economy almost does not participate in the trade Union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began last week, after a Day of thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;when America fell Orgy cheap sales, has captured millions of the inhabitants, and sometimes accompanied by scuffles. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some of the employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and moderate means. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything in the world, from the cradle, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores to increase from 8% to 27% is cheaper, than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, many low-wage workers Walmart merchandised only in his work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations of America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods podeshevke partly because little pays out to its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the difficult conditions of work, for example, to a lack of forklift truck or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants of the shares in &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded to increase the wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance, provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical worker Walmart, the receiving of 9.5 per hour, this expense can not afford it, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart increase среднуюю pay up to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the Corporation to 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on a salary now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entire shift the growth of salaries on the shoulders of the buyers, that each visit to the store will cost them a total of 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> During the year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more, than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart rather say that the protests have taken place only in nine States and are not caused Corporation or малейщего damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; was continued in its stores from 8 o&apos;clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart had sold about 5,000 products in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In the total of the cash registers produced in a &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the Corporation Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview to the left of the site the Huffington Post that the jobs left in the total of &quot;less than five employees Walmart, and that the action of protest was just &quot;another пиаровским trick&quot; which organized the trade Union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash! </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in new York, where their targets were not Department stores Walmart (they are, in the progressive city do not favor, and so they here yet), and &quot;Макдоналдсы&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for the honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Джумейн Williams, a member of the city Council of new York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment the minimum wage, according to the Federal and new York law, is 7.25 x dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants with the time of its increase, but only slightly, and in the middle of their rank and file of the workers receive in new York 8,90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less of them in this expensive city does not make one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can exist in new York on such money, for me it&apos;s incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through &quot;Макдоналдсы&quot; was held nearly a quarter of American teenagers, who had been working for their stalls after school, living with the parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few who saw in it the main source of subsistence or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I constantly have come across in the interview with the workers of the &quot;Макдоналдсов&quot;who complain that should live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, the author which says that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, what will you feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants of the protest, which began at 6 : 30 in the morning on Thursday in &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; on the 40 th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast food systems have begun to pay at least $ 15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the field of fast-food outlets have been established trade Union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration of this discourage and punish activists of the trade Union movement harassment and dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely it easier for them to life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But cover the trade Union of fast food is difficult to objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the major extraordinary fluidity of the personnel. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests were held on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the shares was in the middle of the day rally at McDonald&apos;s next to times square, on which were several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the city Council Джумейн Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, says that he is selling billions of servings, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other prominent new York Democrats, for example, a candidate to the post of the city mayor bill De Бласио, who said that &quot;we must join together in support of workers of fast food, so they have made fair remuneration and economic well-being, which deserves every new йоркец!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described what happened the New York Times, it was the largest action of such kind in the history of the U.S. sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was participated in by only several hundreds of people, though not all of them were workers of fast food service, which in new York employs tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is still unclear whether this will generate the spark of the flame of a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;While fooling the brain turns out medium&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among the fans of modern technologies theme of augmented reality in the last time are taken mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the patent was filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from the conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D-technologies in Кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft Шарамом Изади therefore, for the scientists of the company glasses - phase. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Drawn in by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell us, please, in General terms, what does your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;We are in the human interaction with machines, but while trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> As long as humanity in the mass stuck at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the choice finger at them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We also want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict dramatic changes in the way of interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the prefix Xbox and sensors Kinect is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without Kinect is not sold, it is interesting to жестовое management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What still awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - In spite of the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Entering information improved system receives more data), but the conclusion is not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change it, working on a truly three-dimensional display systems on the basis of different technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> To release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And first of all - to hell with these stupid helmets of a virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> Popular thing, but not overestimate do it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It should definitely not be considered as panacea - the question arises of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we have thought about gestures, but not above the sweeping, and over such meager, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not the camera in your device, and wrist bracelet, which recorded the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Until he is big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in General, the future for the mixed type of control, for example, a gesture+voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;Is that so? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, as you ask me to tell you that can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the same time show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> &quot;Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> &quot;So you want to force users to adapt to something that may or may not at the moment, the car? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think, in the near future, we mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which allow a better identification of the person&apos;s response. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect, what you have claims to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Not enough resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation - is something you can build in our work above three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would get 8 megapixels with the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the matter is not in the мегапикселях, and as a matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From the latter point of view all the current technologies for we are not good enough - it adds to the work of designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the axes X and Y, and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to/with the frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Бетишес of our Рэдмондской laboratory did sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 up to 100 MS, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone is aware of how it affects the interaction between man and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would in my work is very useful to the equivalent of such a device, not demanding touches to frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;And increase the number of cameras don&apos;t need to? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - In the Kinect now have three &quot;camera&quot;, one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And now a third camera - this is, in fact, normal sensor of the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially increasing the number of cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or aggravate it, increasing the amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play around with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, is not presented to the public his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of technology of augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the while of walking, holding smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but that&apos;s what I think: the coolest option would be a &quot;turning&quot; augmented reality, when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to your smartphone, projection display and further everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points - a very personal device, that is their power (private things you see only you), and at the same time the weakness of - augmented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let&apos;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony stark from &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also an ordinary mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem that often indicate the critics of this idea: there is no tactile review! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands don&apos;t feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What kind of answers your group is preparing to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In his lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in a row breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think, the eighth may very well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - using second hand as a substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She is an excellent registers pressing! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are technologies that are really intended to provide that &quot;the pictures in the air&quot; осязаемости - for example, the interference of several aimed ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where is the finger, gives a feeling, but it is very weak, as if you blew on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bracelets on her wrists that affect the nerves in the fingers and toes and is a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;And you tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think that he feels that like to feel in the moment when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - Now it is a good idea, we haven&apos;t tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another challenge that will beat for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, practically infinite - are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not such, as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While fooling the brain turns out medium, work is still very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what makes the work with the virtual reality as attractive for the researcher - many things absolutely in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Вкусовщина instead of culture - Росбалт.ру </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;St. Petersburg avant-garde&quot;, dedicated to the residents of the city, which are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In the top-list of already caught the bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are outside the scope of the city, often finding acclaim in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero Rosbalt - flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed in all red, which is the Russian Museum, the Summer garden, the fashionable hangouts and opening day. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Pictures Kirill Miller always gather a crowd of spectators, where they had not exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the sensitive St. Petersburg social-philosophical storytellers, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright person St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80&apos;s-early 90-ies. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, its appearance on the streets of calling a smile from townspeople, lifts the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently in hands took the hurdy-gurdy and became the St. Petersburg шарманщиком, as ripe for this challenging role of all its Bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all of red, and not in a yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose the color red as a fashion designer, specializing in the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world the color red is a compromise between the artist, имиджмейкером and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society is that a little bit of grey, causes aggression and agitation unkind properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocation directed to the conversation started. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my acts of provocation - an invitation to discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;And when did you understand that you should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - At the exhibition in the Palace of Nevsky Prospekt, where they were exhibited my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free of the unofficial artists was held, and the new, free like me were not understood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and more waves was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I&apos;m in theatre, clothing, music in all genres, but the word. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this combined in your Art-clinic... - it was important for Me to find yourself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory of the Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until it was repaired, there was a musical-artistic club, Bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: the Nomes, Tequila-jazz, I remember, as the Cord is brought with the project &quot;the Ear of van Gogh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a skintight leotard, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>

<seg id="877"> There our employees and patrons of the left. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I was a hero of yesterday century, when a culture is something meant. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the year&quot; was named, I ended my climax. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times on the old rules uncomfortable work, I&apos;m a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years of easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is inherent in a recognizable manner. </seg>
<seg id="884"> &quot;Many of my picture - it&apos;s hits, they pronounced the relevance and acuteness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will program the exhibition, &quot;the Russian Museum in клоунах&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used the social was, is now to be such a pain and fear. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in клоунах all smeared, the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian changing of clothes in the form of an order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now the clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps, his hand submit and you can&apos;t spit in the face should be. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed with the help of changing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;But recently we saw you in the role of an urban an organ-grinder&apos;s. - Cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not me, them to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;Well can and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Is disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people congregated in the pack, La Boheme one loved, suckers another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all the broken in микросообщества, now it&apos;s hard to enjoy it all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I don&apos;t стодолларовая a piece of paper to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we need to think about who will like it. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now everyone has a cult hero at 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> &quot;And the Stas Mikhailov comes in several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - It comes broshenki, there сексо-social sphere is activated. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on the cultural soil 300 people come, and 10 thousand&apos;t come, and as a result less of management, money, everything falters. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing - they do not cheat, do not spoil the property. </seg>
<seg id="908"> As a girl I wrote these paintings, which have a collector of them on the wall beside Falk and Larionov hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, which generally end up. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confused. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of the consumption, this is from another Opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I&apos;m a man of culture yesterday, grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I&apos;m for a culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a concept: an official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not each of them may engage in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> If all the kings of all was not so, the kings, perhaps, not quite understand the culture, but they understood that to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow now, good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have in St. Petersburg there are people who might be experts, but they pushed, so the higher the experts, who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the road. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives вкусовщинка. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Эрарта, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept that there is such artists, which should look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> &quot;What is it to you - Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg is a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is more, the soil is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our rocks art grow hard. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Here in Europe a lot of people любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make the fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented under the grant of Saint-Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Bear in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with an asteroid-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> The caravans of the spacecraft with the humans on Board are sent to find a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save mankind, raises the main question of how to continue the race in the conditions of weightlessness, or on the same spare the planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that little choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact these planets only two that you can learn at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;That&apos;s of Venus and Mars&quot;, - says a senior researcher of the State astronomical Institute named after P.K.. Sternberg (SAI) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> One can live only at high altitude or at the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> To treat matters of reproduction in space began with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago have conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations grown in orbit peas did not differ from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then launch to orbit insects, tiny fruit flies Drosophila. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, in the space sent quail eggs, to check how the embryo develops in the conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get the output of absolutely normal babies. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And then starts the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem related to the fact that this chick must find a support, he must stand up on your feet and start moving,&quot; explains head of laboratory of the Institute of medico-biological problems (IMBP), Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, Chicks randomly tumbled. </seg>
<seg id="951"> After 10 hours in the newborn was complete atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there&apos;s trouble was that in four days they simply perished. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice we вылупляли Chicks, after it refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them&quot;, - noted the failure of the experiment with Chicks in space Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With the animals of the last time the biological &quot;миниковчег&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the биоспутнике &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were to be sent into space already with the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is an isolated experiment, and such studies should be carried out&quot;, - says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to come to the problem of reproduction directly in space is not here yet. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, familiar environment, simply could not realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Man, unlike the animals, in principle, may. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and in a position to create an emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons, these experiments not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But a woman in space flying for almost 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk was the Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious thing there is in mankind, - this woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew away, and no one on Earth could say: will it after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Could she give birth to a child after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;For to this question is no one answer,&quot; says a veteran of the space-rocket industry Vakhtang Вачнадзе. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child Андриян Nikolaev also was an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the first woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice traveled on the orbit and even поработавшей in the open space, was born a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have few, a few, there are astronauts, who after long-haul flights, the cost and growing a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, it is dangerous even if the orbital flights&quot;, - sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, mankind should look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Гидролаборатория CTC is an obligatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work on their skills to work in open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults water, let and comfortable, but still alien environment, the baby - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ихтиандры if confirmed - life on the land went out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months my mother in окоплодной fluid, it is easier to get used then to a little water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, is only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little, to be forgotten&quot;, - says the instructor грудничкового sailing Marina Alekseeva. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if to a child who is born weightlessness a more natural state, for women - is required of gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness senile muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, okay, scratch and this, relying on the stimulators of labor activity. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special cell to go to give birth, she pulls him. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot; - specifies a non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need the artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not feeling the gravity of the earth, the body does not form a skeleton and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, dressed in a special pull-up suit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It would just be deprived of what he would be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, in which we are with you come on, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to the Ground of the disabled person, fully дезадаптированного man,&quot; - foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics of IBMP RAS Igor Lunev. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in outer space is a question of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after a while it will be a reality when the humans in their boats go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of the Main control and revision office: Check the Schwarz-system has failed through the fault of the politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the sector of public procurement Czech Republic has good control authorities and, in spite of the presence of high-quality legislation is lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme audit office, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will not be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough&quot;,- commented on the current situation of feces. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices cause the approach of Peter Нечаса to the so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister has recently said that the ODS (Civic democratic party) would not bother employers &apos; checks - out is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be in any way established, and, if that&apos;s what he forbids, and the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are obliged to verify and enforce the obligations&quot;,- States the feces. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the audit Committee in the Chamber of deputies of you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, in the framework of which was mapped legislation on public procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> About what there was a speech? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> We have in mind a parallel test, which we started, I guess, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, we talk about the fact that the European legislation approves, how to pass the state purchases, followed by the national legislation and then also applied in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All information has been collected and, even in the still unfinished verification, revealed interesting differences &quot; to put it simply, our laws can be &quot;accurate and error-free&quot;, but in practice we use in some respects inferior to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> From this it follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And actually as this project can help you, what he means to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is a joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduction and improved restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of means appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always low) price, to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will achieve this goal, lowering of the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It is possible that this system full of &quot;securities&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much easier, than if the restriction is not decreased. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> And the functioning of the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is there an organization such as our KRU (audit office) or is this different? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards institutions, there in the quality of our KRU is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also the College, working a little differently, but in General both institutions operate in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Additionally, the powers to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a Federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of Federal States - in this case, their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can only manage Federal money, we dispose of public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal audit chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to local legislation, it is easier, than we have? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In General, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can be taken as a sample, but you can&apos;t definitely say that she is the best of all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so because they are better able to cope with the control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I such comparisons do not like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I must say that even exemplary countries are faced with many challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If to speak about the domestic law, as reflected in your facility amendments to the Law on public procurement, somehow manifest consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Taking into account that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it still is not apparent in our work to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we carry out the control on the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Taking this into account only in the process of preparation of the future checks - we started to use our new tool &quot;detection risk неэкономности&quot;, through which we drove almost 14000 of state contracts. We have them analyzed. There is, of course, these changes will occur, because changing limits, change the conditions of certain types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law would benefit or an additional load on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think this law, certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope, it is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem which may arise is that the rules of the &quot;tougher&quot; and them it will be impossible to comply with. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> When the functioning of the previous rules of the regulated companies together with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes - with the regional Council) that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in the case of enforcing the law in such a way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that this is not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error, does not affect the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s recognize that this path will not lead. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister has recently said that the FOC will not be disturbed by employers &apos; inspections of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be in any way established, and, if that&apos;s what he forbids, and the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the bodies, which are obliged to verify and enforce the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;We will change the law and allow it&quot;, but we can not say that we will pretend that nothing was happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement has a rather strict rules, how and what should formally be carried out, and this is correct. It protects public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is a tragedy, when the candidate with the best proposal disqualified only because of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will not be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The road slippery places, but mostly passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some places the Czech Republic road frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Basically they are passable, but in some places with greater caution. </seg>

<seg id="1109"> Together with The Tap Tap we constantly make jokes on this subject, and we say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Could you expound on that readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is about the national event to raise funds, which we are planning now for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, the end of which was declared on December 21 at 11:10. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before the event, the 20-th of December, at 21:00 in parallel will start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They run out, roughly speaking, at the moment when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific ocean, and the time zone of which the 12 hours earlier, than at us, the end of the may calendar. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, but then we all had together with our artist Гонзой Аугустой. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to build up enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to work with the community to think over what the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to assist us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The Tap Tap together with other musicians also sang the national anthem against the end of the world, which is called &quot;the End of the world cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> To hear already fond of listeners YouTube anthem for these бенефисных concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will turn out well and the end of the world will not come. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It sing all the actors in the concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Hymns at the same time will be performed also in live broadcast on Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words to this song I wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip of Tom Ганак, participates in the fulfillment also Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> As you begin to work with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Try to actively connect them to these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that many like to work with us, they are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> On purchase of the equipment for accessible educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year, so we are working with civil Association Tap at the Institute of Едлички. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly visited by students of schools of the Institute of Едлички and spend with them fun and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves have no money to go to the teachers, and we try to thus give them this opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the framework of the project of additional construction of the Institute Едлички in the future I will separate building, in which we go with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert will perform several music groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What were the criteria for selection? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to make a program, which will be interested in all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjan Банго and Jiri Suchy. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> All the details you can find on site www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you plan any such &quot;great event&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In may will be the first to speak at the festival &quot;Prague spring&quot; and then, of course, prepare interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In next year we would be happy to have a representation in the Czech national building in new York, and I personally, if we are in the USA, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with expensive in terms of organization and logistics?? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their stroller must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with the tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until cope with it without problems. Czech airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways has always been superb for us prepared that me how many times wondered. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare different country from the point of view of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have experienced so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all is better than that of the us, in Russia we have witnessed the fact that the East is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared with Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a rarity independent movement of the person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also not there in the course of such trivial things as to give way to the disabled person in the Elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there and there are already public organizations, which are trying to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And what, on the contrary, we should always catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is normal for people with severe disabilities walk on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the Museum, Yes anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to take active part in public life, in that we are them with The Tap Tap a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The esteem of the public or accessibility is one thing, but in the moment, when the us will appear famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, that&apos;s when it really starts to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> While these are isolated cases, people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap at the present time is very popular, but let&apos;s go back to two years ago that, in 1998, made you organize it? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the Institute of Едлички as a teacher, around me were many young people who wanted to do something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am a musician and play including the saxophone, together with a colleague organized interesting music club. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and with time, as our leading Ladya Ангелович, it is a bit out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The popularity came only in the last few years, or I have something mixed up? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It&apos;s true that we helped that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on propaganda of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, in fact as though does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Due to European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Standing there in front of you aim so well unleash The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In Show-business is full of things that mimics one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few rare things, but I would venture to say that Tap Tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all abandoned personalities, which we should feel sorry for me. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but also for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Provided whether the success of the fact that you&apos;re a tough leader, what you consider the many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do good work, we should be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, but when they learn that two times a week they should go to the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At the present time in the group of The Tap Tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them was in the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Making Ангелович. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium Incheba, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava in the centre of the Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In the end of the concert all three cities are connected телемостом at the time of performance of The song of The Tap Tap &quot;the End of the world cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The objective of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for the purchase of a multifunctional accessible equipment for educational centre STUDEO at the Institute of Едлички in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> A ticket for the concert is 400 kroons, for children up to 12 years old are free. Tickets can be bought in advance in the Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At last week&apos;s meeting of Ministers of the European space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began collaboration with ESA in 1994, and during the subsequent years, took an active part in a number of projects of the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the way to outer space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second world war, Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but this is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Let me remind you, for example, about the lecture And. Штернфельда, which on December 6, 1933 represented in the astronomical Observatory of the ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to engineering&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905.) leave the audience indifferent, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Ian Gadomsky was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the Robert Esnault-Пельтри and Andre Louis Hirsch for the &quot;Introduction to engineering&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Ian Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), which was mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomsky became known world promoter of space, and its contribution was estimated at including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway trolley, equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even to disperse or to stop the trolley was to be used rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this the cart is known only from the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about the missile arrows. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> A study conducted Section technology weapons in collaboration with professors Mieczys? Вольфке and Gustav Мокжицким. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining materials shows that the research progressed to the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of the German troops work was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in specialized print the idea of the photovoltaic missile destroyer, which was proposed by the engineer Rogosinski, and in the following year came the work of &quot;Air missile-torpedo, and aviation rocket-bomb&quot; of the author Леливы-Кживоблоцкого. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all of the projects of the military use of missile technology was engaged in the Interim scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the end of the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The following scientific work devoted to the cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the company mentioned in the November issue of 1954 of the journal &quot;Problems&quot;, which contains four large article on Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, Professor M. Суботович proposed to organize a society, which will be engaged in space science and technology. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish society of Astronautics (PHA) tried to join the international Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn, it became its full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the following year, the first Chairman of the PHA Kazimierz Заранкевич (1902 - 1959) was the Vice President of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, made a scientific study. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, capable to overcome a distance of 1800 m, was in the length of about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later there was built the advanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on the Бледовском wasteland, tests were carried out a two-stage missile RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was in the length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work &quot; rocket RM-34 could overcome 14,5 km, and its task was watching high-altitude wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first missiles of the RM became rocket meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and a starting weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Were developed three types (identified as meteor-1A, -1B and 1C), which varied the size of the camera for the scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Rocket meteor-1A had the space of a volume of 0.4 l, meteor-1B - 0,34 l, and meteor-1C - 0,62л. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Maximum flight range with all three types is 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute was the development of rocket meteor-2 and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Rocket meteor-2 with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring the payload weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then were built version of meteor-2 and meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee on space research) in 1960, and the establishment of the national Committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, in the framework of the program Intercosmos, Poland participated in the research of outer space for the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the act on public works - it is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decree provoked lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, is not limited to the movement of private capital together with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant differences in the price of labour (wages) there is a price voltage. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept you need to understand the condition, when the manufacturer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to survive in economic competition of the fact that the &quot;knocks&quot; the cost of a competitor with a view to pick up a large part of the market and, thus, increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a mass scale it means for the majority of the employers or the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchase abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labor force, compared with other, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the produced by them unemployment, the growing necessary expenses of the state for social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In General, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the masters of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social, the economic and social harm done by them in pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known, there is no need to give specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Vulgar methods of private capital create in the economies of individual States situation, when the governments of the countries are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the purpose of attraction of foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of the private capital, in spite of the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected first of all in the changes of the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is economically force his people to obey the dictates of private capitalл first of all in the sphere of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as an instrument of reduction of workers &apos; rights in the sphere of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is increased levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the rich and poor . </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany already for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves from their work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people is already close to a million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the framework of improving the competitiveness of the German economy and there are frequent cases when employed people receive a salary, that the state must pay, that they receive the minimum subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all of the southern States of the EU, undoubtedly, lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of the catastrophic decline in the social status, forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on starvation wages on the margins of society, in the hope that someday will come to the country private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> However, the question is, from where will it come? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or he did not come at all, so as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argue that the state can not participate in the capital of their own farm, which controlled economy leads to economic collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the government should not control the actions to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Further, it should answer the question, not whether private capital, is now virtually managing policies and so the entire state, in his own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The unequivocal answer is Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of an almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have a desperate situation, manifests itself in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserved the punishment, however, is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is such that the public Ministry due to lack of financial resources entrusted with drafting the private law firms, which are closely connected with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills approves the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the Constitution of the Western type, and from the financial and powerful groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious, that the liberal-oriented democracy now is quickly in such a situationи as described Аппианом in his work иthe Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeyея :the State has long breaksс and departments engaged in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal obtaining of favor with the help of stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the elections with pre-sold voice&quot;&quot;...decent people do not stand for election to the post of Governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without Consul&quot;.. .. &quot;Seriously began to speak about the fact that the only salvation in this horrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose energetic man &quot;.. Appian thought it would be Pompey, but they became Caesar, which has replaced democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> Just as in ancient times, the modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without consideration of public interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform deeper nature. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> So the cause of the fascist and Communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy liberal type can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First of all it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, Humanities and social catastrophe, which already we are seeing, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the act on public works, is not a solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this tendency is of a systemic nature. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will allow to strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Of violence nothing will come of it, and can never go out&quot; - sting, the song &quot;Fragile&quot;, where the main verse of the refrain are the words: &quot;do not forget, what we fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want wars, they would not have been&quot; - dying Гутель Shnaper, wife Meer Амшела Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, has caused many responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing its position by the fact that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are acting in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate about who in the recurrent waves of killings - the perpetrator and victim, in the end, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and do not have witnessed the outbreak of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, to see the person first of all serve as a continuing already 95 years voltage (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind - it is above all the story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear - always if these people are completely independently take steps, or for the throne was a someone, who guided their actions to advance the goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Have to admit that we live in a period when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and resulting from them power could not happen in the life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically rich families is allocated one, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don&apos;t know if someone above them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> A lot about them do not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news Agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 90-ies of the 19 century, to stop the rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher realms, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both, and to ensure, and to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have a large block of shares in almost all the Central banks of the world, and against the countries whose Central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was a total of 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow Gaddafi was only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist the family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for Ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war he began to publish their own (meaning - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F.. Kennedy began to issue its own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal reserve system), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after the fact, as wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of the Great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859, in 1871 led to the development plan of the three world wars, created great Freemason of the 33-th level of albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchial States in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population of up to approximately 0,5-1 billion people (a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be otherwise, except as the prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the working group of the wealthiest families in the Chapter with the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of the decision (order ab chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the reason the FED, which was to prevent a repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to untie the First world war by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik революциию. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended sudden, unjustified in military and economic terms capitulation of Germany (already it was not necessary to war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, there was a fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the unleashing of the Second world war, the bankers and the politicians have created a hidden conflict situation, put it on Germany huge war reparations, it created a prerequisite to a radicalization of the impoverished masses, then could only throw the Germans strong enough, denouncing the perpetrators, and offers simple solutions Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a heavy German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, with kindling of the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19-th century the Rothschilds have provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, was the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> Ignited the Second world war, it is difficult to assess, escaped Hitler of the circuits, in which he was initially held bankers, or all that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by the war reparations to the 2nd world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a hotbed of war of the third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers can get her to untie, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, has become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, easier speaking, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel - it is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspiration to the world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here it is necessary to distinguish between ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, the international bankers pushed the people to vote in the elections by their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing the best to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given the control of Iran over Ормузским Strait, containing 20% of all world oil reserves (Maritime corridor is only 2 miles wide), and also lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light now manifest the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;All that we need is a General breakdown crisis, and the people accept the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in their opinion, it is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of the financial aristocracy, enjoying comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world where everyone is born the body at birth gets chip, with whom he becomes a being, which is under total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or on his forehead the mark, so that a person, which is not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> That&apos;s what wisdom: everyone who has a mind, can calculate the number of the beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred threescore and six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Film &quot;Operation &quot;Argo&quot;: When the worse, call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took hostage of 52 diplomat. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They should have been released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which was the patron Saint of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the us administration to a positive outcome of the situation do not suggest she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard, because it is in the root could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, she was not able to. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations with the mediation of the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate has caused the house of a wave of solidarity and bred anti-Iranian sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran to a great extent contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of 1980, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck &quot;Operation &quot;Argo&quot; describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of the six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a challenging twists and turns they had completed their way to the residence of the Embassy of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with the canadian authorities managed to take them out of Iran, with the help extravagant a cover story, according to which they went to the canadian passports as members of the crew, подыскивавшие in the country of location for the filming of science-fiction epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the expert on &quot;the evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the film project , arranged press conference, a fictitious manufacturing company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation for a long time kept secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Аффлека - it is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political Thriller, the so-called &quot;film-киноопус&quot;, the story of a successful venture, Scam - an example could be a number of films about the friends Оушена. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film are constantly changing moods on the one hand, documented conceived scene from Tehran (in the credits are shown significant historical photos of the events and the way the same situation were shown in the movie &quot; the big differences in the no). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies of the men in suits discuss the situation at the table of negotiations, on the stairs institutions, on the phone ... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Аффлеку wonderful managed to restart career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From высмеянного actor became a respected film Director, and his game has ceased to be object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;Operation &quot;Argo&quot; his third film, after dark detective &quot;good-bye, baby, goodbye&quot; (2007) and the Thriller &quot;the City&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, this is the first film Аффлека, which is not removed in the native city of the Director - Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of place in this refers to the qualities, which raised earlier films over Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck manifests it in the &quot;Argo&quot;, where Tehran of &quot;playing&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the movie are taking place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the Embassy are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changed history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues make the scenes fake (fake headquarters at the Tehran Bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The Director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes film values. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is working quite well with this a little, sometimes that something to think out - where all of this is not so elegant (a scene in which a telephone call to America prevents the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the pursuit of the landing runway look pretty far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The disadvantage of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters deserved to have more space, and they are in the movie by far not the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Аффлека lacks a bit of drama, this is the movie that can be watched with mild interest in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating mystery / Thriller seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But captures with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for a reminder about the one, all the more in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated idea of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules inflate the balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.comannually, the interviewer about the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd decree or project from the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We got to the last event, in which the EU is planning to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,&quot; - said &quot;the Law&quot;, the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the already put forward by the nomination абсурдностей is the recent decision of the European court of unification of the rates of insurance contributions for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies they objectively are less exposed to risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can be nominated in the competition until the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,&quot; said Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> To the controversial regulations of the EU applies, for example, and the mandatory addition of biological components in the fuel, that as a result of causing harm to the nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or the Directive on the amount of cages for chickens, in consequence of which in this year significantly risen eggs . </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticised was the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;бутербродное oil&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of the classic light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas should be the length of 14 inches. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The pan-European machine often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protected by any state or group of States (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the Council of Europe upholds the requirements of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union should reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to be &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonises existing disparate national rules, which complicated the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, in spite of the opposition of some States, all the same softened standards for fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directives will lead to the waste products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Candidate to win in the survey can be and last year&apos;s decision of the EU, according to which sold balloons must be equipped with warning that children under eight years of age may not inflate them without supervision of adults. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU appealed to American studies, in accordance with which the balloons in the game are the potential causes of infant death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Such restrictions now apply for children up to 14 years, who are prohibited from blow at a fair dudelki. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Funny ideas are born and home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Enough is absurd and rule concerning the European officials that everyone who is in the EU any official position, may not, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, the use of the name Macedonia, and should instead say &quot;FYROM (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Union of liberal economists &quot;the Principle of non-interference&quot; (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above mentioned absurd rules, for example, the rule of the EU on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the member States. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which she had a big fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the questionnaire was also interested in the idea of pay some countries, because they have no sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for the application for receiving subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas appeared in Prague, and not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Ask the European Union about compensation&quot;, - stated in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ЧСДП). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument he pointed out that the country had high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases the state had the full warehouses of stocks, which had to be evacuated. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for obtaining subsidies offered villages of the Ministry for regional development, led by the Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on the preparation of applications for subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Weird orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although regulations in member States easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU to regulate, as well as on the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to experts, is the utilisation of the EU on projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, however, which the member States have achieved during the discussion of the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Causes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right on the specific identity of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians have kept the name &quot;Оломоуцкие cheese&quot;, but &quot;Туземский rum&quot;, a tradition which in our country have their roots in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the &quot;Туземак&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Be called rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheese &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;горгондзола&quot;, marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parma ham, have already been, for example, the Karlovy vary crackers, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие tubes. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to protect the Republic, but I&apos;m an Amateur, - says Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. Senator, as a man comes into his head to run for the post of the President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I do not think that to become a Senator or the President. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If in our country we have all functioned without any problems, then I wouldn&apos;t have had any run. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can not see how in the last 20 years, the country can be stolen, as here, the bustling thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like it, then try to find a solution, how to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I already was full forty years old and I&apos;m an independent person, not belonging to any party, I have no other opportunities to influence things, except to run for the post of a Senator or the President. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the President&apos;s castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do not turn if you so back to the people who you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I talked all the time, that the turn in the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the results of the election to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I said that if I selected a Senator, I will run for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a position, the position - it is a tool, with the help of which I can implement their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the most impact, and extensive powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the difficulty is not only in the fact that we as a nation murmur among themselves in the bar or in front of the TV, but it ready to trample on anyone trying to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To this are added the mass media, which human tarnished, and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom of lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, I said that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was the Advisor Jiri Пароубека. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the theses of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property declarations to the amount of over twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To achieve this, it is necessary to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have as a President of such powers is not, and only a Senate may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct excursions became free enterprise, it managed to promote. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is политиканстве - when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or to the right, he deliberately thwarted, and this constrains the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent non-party man, I have a much greater potential for obtaining support from all of the parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I have no party folded on the shelves, without regard to the dogmas can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a man, more related to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me is not at all important - a little to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it is important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not that someone applies to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good for the company&apos;s decision, will suggest whether it КПЧМ or the FOC, and I sure as hell would be against bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You get angry when someone says that you are populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But not proving to you that what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some kind of ideal goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And to this you try to come closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all proposals, to which I say, already operate in the world, or speak of them prominent experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the Parliament you will only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with this in politics, you won&apos;t last long. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you walk up to people and talk to them, then you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to win them over to their side, so we have made it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected President, it shouldn&apos;t be a problem to organize the direct television broadcast, in which I will return to the presidents of the parliamentary parties with an appeal to legitimize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in case of refusal, will need to inform, why didn&apos;t want to. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality, which makes abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the President - it was the merit of pressure from the public. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Say directly that I am an Amateur and not a genius and not intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I&apos;m only a beginner in politics, and the program will try to get support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The case, I try to promote their own; in that case, if it does not succeed, after six years of finish and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is partly sounds like Okamura must save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not the Savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one I wouldn&apos;t do anything, so I walked around a number of well-known people with a proposal to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused in connection with great volume of the work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Well at least I supported the leading investigative journalist Jan Лоренцову, which revealed the fraud with light fuel oil products. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but right now I feel like in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went to selected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are independent in the Senate, only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> About this I have not thought, because I don&apos;t have time to check the purity of the past each of the potential supporter, and I don&apos;t have the money for it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money for a presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You are talking about property declarations, how about your own business with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property is estimated approximately in 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague value of approximately 25 million, apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of the works of art of approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda superb in a million, well, a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way Aston-Martin came to me, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James bond, who traveled by car, was gallant with the women and at the same time, fought against the baseness and wickedness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive the Aston-Martin, own property at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money especially in this invest not want to. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million to the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I have to get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I have already invested 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I don&apos;t have to pay for the pre-election campaign out of his own pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Expenditure on the campaign me in fact cover сенаторская salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But for this money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son of the English school, which is 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted only to earn money, so anywhere would not run. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So, then you will engage in entrepreneurship, so that you can live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you say that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, its activities I partially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the managing Director of a tourist Agency in the spring will be my Deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like to, that I was бессребренником, which will store the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also have to live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How many, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to receive on a monthly basis? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I get further and further. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became President, his business would have ended. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview you can find in the Saturday issue of the paper &quot;Right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Architects MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example Спейкениссе and its newly built Book mountains - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;This building seems fun, it looks futuristic, finally we again can see something interesting,&quot; says Lisette Верхайг, entrance on the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stephen Спермон, it specialist at the nearby large enterprise, thinks so: &quot;No, this building is really beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask myself: why do we need today is another library? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet access, iPad, and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now there are no volunteers going to the old-fashioned library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Спейкениссе, малопримечательному a residential campus under the Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this annoying fact a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution to General education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on banknotes of Euro, in the form of beautifully painted miniatures from reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative has been modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the city fathers understood that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build here the library!!! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame Maas from Rotterdam&apos;s architectural Bureau MVRDV, master bold bar charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, reacted to a problem with his usual calmness and appeared on the competitive listening in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury in a puzzled look and shook his shoulders, daring Maas resigned from his original gift to a pyramid in size and completed a speech in defense of his project with the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my proposal: &quot;Portrait mountain&quot; in Спейкениссе, the so-called Букенберг! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, this mountain value of 30 million Euro has increased. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground Parking garage, a supermarket, post office and a few of the adjacent houses and villas for a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In the beginning of November &quot;Portrait mountain&quot; was awarded with the second prize of the contest &quot;the Best library of the Netherlands in 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Also the project participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb, who previously could not offer anything except post-modern pedestrian area and the amazingly beautiful town hall, the white facades which suggests the idea that the milk-processing factory, became richer by one modern piece of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But the most important thing - in Спейкениссе was the first in the history of this town a public building for cultural purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> A long road to book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: book Eldorado under the hood for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is only one Elevator that runs through the centre of the mountain, because the real fans of architecture and reading prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Остекленное from all sides of the room is bright and easy to foreseeable, floors made of baked bricks and elegant street lights accurately create the feeling of the public of the town square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is recreated ideal. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Eyes involuntarily looking for a bench, dogs and playing soccer boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually bookshelves stand along the facade, and is located in the middle of a large, dark room, as a rule uncomfortable and faceless,&quot; said Winnie the Meuse. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have set the classical configuration space from legs on a head and pulled the area to be read from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The internal space of the book of the mountain used skillfully: in the center of the offices are located, online library, chess club, ecological centre and technical premises. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially pleased with the black book shelves, which serve as the finish of the walls, parapets, the stair railing. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture, and smell unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even seasoned architects and engineers-builders guess, what kind of unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We sought to work with secondary materials&quot;, - explains Йоп Трауборст, project Manager, representing the community Спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once on one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met the appropriate by-product of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in the greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of applied artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles is one season, and after that it can be disposed of. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes were Packed in the thickness of four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into the dark, uniform, strong material, to smell a little reminiscent of a new car and a little sneakers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> On top conduct 105 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Those who overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch крокетами and wood фикусами in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and first of all on the correct humidity of the air in the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The costs of a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of the environment,&quot; says Троуборст. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For its heating and cooling is used warmth of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the Portrait mountain stands under a glass cover, even on clear days, the sun enters the only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Broad farm laminated wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on the most of the sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Indoor climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the protection is provided by a fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Спермон, mentioned above, a skeptic of the it sector, has already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Верхайг also was there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Богард, which is called Букенберг &quot;the soul of Спейкениссе, which has long lacked&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves of the not yet fully developed the library - at that time it was of 70,000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves crammed to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library&quot;, &quot; the architect says blame Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that, thanks to our invitation now every inhabitant in some way connected to this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the Royal task, which at the professional jargon is called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Спейкениссе wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And even if they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is only the starting point for the construction of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans have to play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow the diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week of Germany first made it clear that she will vote against the application of the Palestinians to receive observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained from voting. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israel in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany it is necessary to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - it is not speaking too critical with respect to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of exclusion zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO held this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany it is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is so. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact that she is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely, moving from policy, which, so to speak, ruled by the United States, to actually German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed a common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they&apos;re not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only look for their part, but are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy, which conducts France or the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly means &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy with the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a willingness to hold in its own national interest position that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy depends on the economic policy, that is, from the export and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and so Germany must defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these economic interests to the position in the middle East conflict and to the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has large markets in the middle East, in particular in the States of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays its role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-way communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Harmed, whether Germany its relations with the United States, while making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States prevails understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think that it was the same dramatic breakdown, as in the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany will acquire thus some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The us, on the contrary, clearly spoke for the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> If there is a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European States? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Into force of the American domestic policy, such differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with the local political situation of the government, of course, could not openly take such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always seems to be. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not in delight from the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to Germany combine their close ties with Israel and the us on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that&apos;s what makes the situation so difficult for Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would have been a little easier if there was a common, consistent European policy, but this is not so today. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they may not be part of the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on our own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That&apos;s what they do with the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will take a lead role in the development of common European positions. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that in Germany it is difficult, if only because of the ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player - do not take the himself really the main role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or the leading role of the still difficult to give Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany still not used to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still always difficult to give a significant role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the crisis of the Euro - every time, when Germany takes on a major role, manifested the various antigermanskie feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans did not just deal with that. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, this is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account the very different neighbours and opinions, but this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Thus, the influence of the USA in European politics is constantly diminishing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans just going to have to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like it, unpleasant or strengthens a dislike to you - this is the life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo, Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, the Institute, in which academics and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America together investigate the problem of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Szabo - a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German policy, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks&quot; in China: when the Puma, and Armani will suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is absolutely officially registered in China, the name which has nothing in common with the firms from the names of which it is formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names is not submit a claim. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Паттлох, the lawyer of the company Taylor Wessing, specializing on violations of the rights to the trademarks in the Russian far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my Desk every week appears on the new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Bone substitute is enough to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci turns Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> This way legally copied German companies, for example producer of sports goods Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Паттлох opens the folder with records of the Department of registration of trademarks in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> on 14 September 2010, a Chinese company is registered there&apos;s trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are the world Champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property rights, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities there are multi-storey Department stores, selling almost exclusively forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, the case Паттлоха not such. On behalf of our principals &apos; it is against that Chinese enterprises officially received from the Department of registration of the trademark the right to use a name that already protected by somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call this &quot;ban минпай&quot;, mark-the passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with the &quot;ban дакуань&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The so-called women looking for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It causes damage to the business, it is necessary to struggle&quot;, - is convinced Паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Trade mark is washed away, the unique position of being lost, image suffers greatly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors is estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive original products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company for market research at CLSA, China with a sales volume of EUR 15 billion per year is the third in size and the most rapidly growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the register of trade marks difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Паттлох tells about cases in which the court rejected the claims, because after a long time опротестованное name became &quot;the reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the claimant does not lucky, it will even have to pay плагиатору, as the damage to its trade mark in China, said Паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes is ruled by the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous works of graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, enterprise, which shortly before the acquired firm-manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Bought Volvo company Geely originally used the blue-and-white logo, like a BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Manufacturer of fashionable goods Lacoste lost in the bone substitute China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looking in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Department of registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in the year 2010 because of the shortage of personnel and equipment of the premises there took place the difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the past year there has been a &quot;return from the emergency situation in the working process of the norm&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the quantity of raw Affairs on objections decreased by 22 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 per cent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To combat this expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year in CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trade marks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record means that China, for the tenth time in a row headed the list of new registrations around the world, reports the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademark, only 5.5 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan charges. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If to simplify, this means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euro. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Appeal against its worth many times more, as shown by the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the group is fighting against the Chinese плагиатора. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans succeeded in ensuring that the illegal production of them counterfeit automotive parts, was liquidated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator secured the Chinese the right to a trade mark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was his own omission, as the names in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Вентцлер, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the office of the registration of the trade marks CTMO rejected the claim of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You must be on the alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The question now is on consideration in the Supreme court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Вентцлер hopes to bring it to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;the Process is extremely roads and it takes a lot of time, money and nerves&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs are hardly taken into account, the archive of the company had to look even acts of a hundred years ago, to bring evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg to no avail offered by the opposing side of the &quot;big six-figure sum in euros&quot; for a settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;From this it is clear how much that we should,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Namely, in the case of simulators register there for a unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register a name of Freudenberg for footwear and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We must be vigilant,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and lawyer Паттлох recommend that German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Is not enough to rely on the international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be &quot;all that in any way worth defending, register also in China,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can cost much more expensive than registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg lose in the final act of his drama about the trade mark, he shall pay the other party a license fee for their own name, explains Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise, we will supersede from the market in the disputed segment. </seg>

<seg id="1713"> According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations programme on HIV / AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected people. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland live 245 000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> With more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 of AIDS orphans in the village of Эситжени Association Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend school in preparation for further education. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on the patronage of the corps. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It ensures the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot meal in The centre. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Имбонги in the same language means the narrator or восхвалитель. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this hall do not speak fluently on the Bantu, but know how to sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Almost ten years the choir learns the songs on this alien soft language and from time to time even bring them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers the summer of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village Эситжени, which depends on the votes of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> &apos;re infected with forty percent of the </seg>
<seg id="1726"> There live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, among the inhabitants of many children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them were left without parents, who have died from the virus ICH. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Эситжени in miniature reflects the disease of the whole Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the world&apos;s lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection by half, among the population almost not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland are in themselves immunodeficiency virus, the death of the middle of the fourth dozen - not a rarity. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village in the joint field visit to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Имбогни saw a lot of children on the streets, which is not enough not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without school education a person in a poor country there is no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was a private obligation of the individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later, the choir founded the Association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, which has since almost professionally caring for orphans of AIDS in Эситжени. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> To bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and триппер (gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Лобковый pediculosis and scabies are to parasitic STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main affected groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, and the conveying occurs as a result of sexual contacts between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In heterosexual adults frequent sexually transmitted diseases, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have a comparatively low, however, about 20 per cent of new HIV infections belongs to this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people chlamydial infections are found significantly more often than among other groups of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> On the European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> We have among young people is also a common human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How to change the number of cases of infection? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to obligatory registration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections in 2007 reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011 there were about 2700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> In infectious diseases may occur ulcers in the field of гениталий, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can he protect himself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Female condom can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide absolute protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Partly because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases, may also be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> That is why experts recommend routine screening, especially with the frequent change of sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> In the early diagnosis can cure the majority of STIs and avoid long-term consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Patronage, donations and not in the last turn royalties for performances of the choir for the whole of Germany allow something to collect. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;All we have sent to Эситжени already about 200 000 euros,&quot; says Annette Леннартц, Chairman of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village of money from Germany disposes of Цодва Dlamini, a conscious and active woman. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also cares about the fact that the orphans were well arranged, for example one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Gogos, as it is called in the same old women, the center of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and took care to children in the form of every day in time appeared on the lessons. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who have no relatives left, come to the shelter to Ханийсиле, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the Association, as well as two cooks, who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, the Association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; organized a sewing school, built a two coop and together with the American organization of the health PSI organized the delivery of HIV test for many of the residents of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious in the country, prefer deep silence. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The king, with 14 women </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Леннартц, &quot;because it is associated with sexuality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for a country, in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III, known for his love to excess. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> In particular, on such authorized state life style also lays the blame for the fact that the virus ICH so spread quickly in the past years. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But she is also on stray workers, who can spread the virus in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free female condom is literally on every corner, &quot; says Annette Леннартц, &quot;but they are almost not used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The other culture is flesh of the flesh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To little to support the cultural exchange, the choir Ибмогни every two-three years, traveled throughout South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern region of the black continent known since the times of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Bus full of whites, who sing songs in the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened that caused the tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip is always leads also in Эситжени, where the singers visit the sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In spite of the fact that small village with hard to find on the map, in the valley of the river Эцулвени it is more than well known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to the Эситжени, there is a light,&quot; say the people here. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when топающие singers are back in the rehearsal room on the street Бергхаймер, you can see that this light is lit and here also. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA opens the ice on mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that the planet mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Ice can have a thickness of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The space Agency of the USA NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as is evident from the three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that constantly hiding in the shadows of the region of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness should be at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Presumably, the water comes from a comet or, perhaps, an asteroid collided with mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one has linked the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the head of the scientific probe Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature of the mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these findings could help explain how water and other construction elements of life were in other places in the Solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes and telescopes and small robots, such as &quot;Phoenix&quot;, exploring the depths of the Universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time they send to the Ground image: small Windows in the infinite expanse. </seg>

<seg id="1818"> Depending on the color pictures of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Published by the European southern Observatory of the picture shows the remote for a few thousand light-years nebula Трифид in the constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of the Трифид comes from the Latin word trifidus (трехдольный, трехраздельный), as the dark band of dust are divided into three parts-hot heart of the cradle of the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In Serpens astronomers have photographed the precursor of a cosmic collision: at the distance of 400 million light-years from Earth kernel of the two merging galaxies rushing to meet each other and will face. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our views in the Universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Липперсгеем - before Galileo Galilei year later began to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then mirror optical telescopes became more and more - and the available of their view of the space deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> In the course of 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope &quot;JAL&quot; in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters. </seg>

<seg id="1843"> Mirror &quot;of a Large South African telescope in South Africa segmentation - for the sake of reducing the cost. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> However in diameter it is roughly eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of affordable design: the telescope is rigidly bolted under the vertical angle - this limits his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope &quot;Hobby-Эберли&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> It features: high светособирающая ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> She reaches - in spite of relatively small diameter of the mirror - the world&apos;s largest telescopes. </seg>

<seg id="1883"> A minibus with a rumble on the winding road past overgrown with dense forests of the hills, the rough rivers and simple peasant houses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> All around so green and bright, what you might think, if you were in the black forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here live Talysh - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are spoken in Farsi and азербайжданском and differ longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> The end point is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> A small town boasts too ponderous architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe is almost not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> At 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian sea, here, in the province is not yet reached. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilate Фатулаева (48) is convinced, that in Lerik, there is something to interest tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In may of Baku became famous festival Eurovision song contest - and in the next year, there will be a festival of the oldest people of the world,&quot; says Фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably unique in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is documented biography about eight dozen of the Talysh people of these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, and is 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years he had another baby </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the Museum is the shepherd Ширали Мюслюмов, who allegedly was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificate, however, is not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> But given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, the age of 122 years, the age of the Мюслюмова it is extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; explains Фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> A man has been married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years, he has allegedly daughter was born. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So Li added shepherd Мюслюмов a couple of dozen years to your age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher, age, from the max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of livers in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;A surprising number of people of old age can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia is also a lot of very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, since there was no register of civil status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless it is a fact that people in the district of Lerik is strikingly often reach the biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now here lives of 20 people older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here, in the South, so a lot of long-livers? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani guide Farid Мугимзаде explains this specific genes of the Talysh people. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The Director of the Museum Фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysh like meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, many of them to drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such high-calorie diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or work in a primitive way of life, which keeps people the youth? In Ченгемиране, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Рубаба Mirzoev. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In 97 years, she still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzaev, who claims that she has 143 child lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasian region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here under one roof live eight people, including one of his sons and the daughter of Mirzaeva, which have long ago already has his grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby ride two kids. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen the guests prepare the tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied glass армуду. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The Mirzaeva perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the head scarf she hides long dark brown tresses that her son with pride to reveal to us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always have my hair milk, so that they never fall in and saved the color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I had never used the shampoo&quot;, - says Mirzaev. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only that has increased in the private yard, tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In all my life I never buy products in the store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was after the Second world war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it was better when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is often sounds in the speech of an old woman. </seg>

<seg id="2004"> Take a few overripe pieces of cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothing. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> You&apos;ll have отшибающий smell the smell of ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in a little town called Фагернес, a three-hour drive from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Around the snow covered scenic views. This is very beautiful, but in the air permeated the evergreen characteristic smell. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Ракфиск are trout, sprinkled with salt and бродившая in the water up to a year, depending on what exactly the duck to do. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As dusk and cold, crowds of Norwegians are going to the festival in Фагернесе, dedicated to this most, so to say, the lovely dish. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;Her eat a raw and washed down with a glass of Aquavita, local тминной of vodka,&quot; - explains Хавард Хальварсен, local fire by profession and at the same time &quot;ракфисковый General&quot;, which governs the conduct of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Everywhere around us there are people eat cut in small cubes fish and wash down with her considerable portions of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Someone more like Akwawit than ракфиск,&quot; says Хавард. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This drink is able to kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I&apos;m trying out a couple of pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can carry a piece of the nose, all is not so bad - little different from that portion of the land, you have taken the bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Ракфиск - the Norwegian product of absolutely other times, the times of poverty, when, before the advent of the refrigerators, the fish in the autumn steeped in sealed barrels with salt water. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then deep in winter, when the fish is well and thoroughly забродила, its extracted and, after the perception of alcohol, used as food. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Still the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, primarily in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13% are immigrants, which here involve jobs, higher wages and a well-developed social security system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The inhabitants of Sweden (longtime rival, and not so long ago, and far more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Ракфиск is perceived as a kind of an important symbol, an indispensable, though, and a few empty element of the last Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you in 9 pounds ($14). </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the country it is, it seems, are satisfied with. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Брейвика, racist and extremist right-wing, in the past year расстрелявшего and killed 77 men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Not mentioning his name, the attack is called &quot;what happened on July 22&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> In the basis of today&apos;s well-being of Norway lies growth (since the beginning of the seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason of our prosperity,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, разносящая trays with distinguished ракфиском, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We the people &quot; as you call it is reasonable. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Like most Norwegians, she speaks very good English. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We don&apos;t like to exhibit at the show, we do not boastful. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway very carefully treats its oil - most of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special Fund created for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> In the years before the world financial crisis, when all sorili the money, which they have not had, Norway frugally calculate all the costs. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as you can ski in the winter and Hiking in summer, this is sufficient for happiness&quot;, - says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And there are ракфиск,&quot; she adds with a careless laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I&apos;m standing in the snow in the queue for some food - ракфиска good enough for me. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Here&apos;s a hamburger with elks meat - it is certainly exotic and tasty juicy meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening we will see even more of the same fish with unforgettable aroma. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In my accommodation are conducting a special dinner dedicated to ракфиск, in the course of which the visitors vote determine the best or, perhaps, the most fragrant fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> Is direct TV air, in which the show of the bow tie, surrounded by plates with ракфиском. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It&apos;s like the song contest &quot;Eurovision&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;So, the top-Jurgen, what grade you set for the best fish they got themselves in the mountains?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Yes, Хавард, here&apos;s our assessment&quot;.... </seg>
<seg id="2047"> All laughing and applauding. </seg>

<seg id="2050"> The President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto to be a difficult start of a career. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> Until the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to enter the office, a correspondent of the BBC&apos;s will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties with which it will face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico city now in especially bad condition. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> This city is overloaded transport, and in the best time, and on Monday were erected steel fences, перерезавшие several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, this was not done in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the participants of the protest to get to the Parliament building. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto put on the presidential band, and will take over the reins of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Before him is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has made good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now creates its powers, but the country is mired in the drug war, which for six years already claimed about 60.000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government claims the people of Mexico on its readiness to combat violence&quot;, - said earlier this week Mr. Pena Nieto us President Barack Obama in the oval office of the White house. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> To such statements next to the President of the United States political career Mr. Pena Nieto has developed in the post of the Governor of his home state of Mexico city. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, in a populous and vast state, the capital of the country, the opinions of the new head was divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Straight man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic village of Valle de Bravo, for example, remembered him with warmth. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents put him in the merit of revival of tourism, the development of the resort sphere and creation of the infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> You can reach the city on one of the new highway, built by g-Ohm Pena Nieto, which are very different from those roads with potholes and pits, which were previously in this place. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plate with his name is hung on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive Museum devoted to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We associate with him hope for a real and serious changes,&quot; says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, Congressman of the state of the led Pena Nieto the institutional revolutionary party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect real and drastic change, which needs so much of our country, first of all in the sphere of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years of continuous stay in power is the party PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 years of absence in the presidential Palace Los Pinos party places great hopes on the Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> In addition, he denied the accusations in бессодержательности that were put forward by the new President of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of the incarnation of his vision of the future of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is an excellent statesman, and, first of all, the person, able to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in another part of the state, many people have different perceptions of the former Governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The municipality Scoundrel, known as the Ciudad Operations, represents the most striking contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under highway overpasses, he is in many ways is a suburb of the Mexico city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality, too, are of a severe nature of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, for the pacification of the bands, selling drugs in these areas, have been involved troops; and violence against women is here particularly acute. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a vacant lot near the extensive landfill only for last two years it was found several dozens of bodies of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico city during the governorship Mr. Pena Nieto - it considerably exceeds the similar indicator in the sadly famous violence city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name became a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Nieto, about him in the best case we can say that during his tenure as Governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of the murder of women. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, his administration was accused in complete disregard of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> The inhabitant of the concrete, like the majority of the homes in the dilapidated area, Irenaeus Буэндия barely holding back tears, showing me photos of his dead daughter Mariana Moon. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of Marian in 2010, committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believes that she killed her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I got to her house, it seemed that her body before it was washed,&quot; recalls Ms. Буэндия. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was cold and stiff. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Mother Mariana recounts this story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs around with a crucifix, on which is inscribed with just one word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> It is in this, according to them, was denied the family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;Officials of the state have treated me like an old gossip, reluctant breaker of the peace. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people simply took for granted all the things that they say, and kept quiet. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, it is impossible, in particular when there are so many violations and gaps,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Wearing a presidential belt on Saturday, the President Pena Nieto together with her take on the formidable task of responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes associated with violence, and the new President promised to make the solution of this problem a priority during his reign. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that he will be exactly the same President, what was the Governor&quot;, - says Olvera, Congressman from Valle de Bravo from the party of the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But this is exactly what most of all afraid of families of victims in Ciudad Operations. </seg>

<seg id="2132"> Answering the questions of the judge on Friday, manning said that he understood from the order of the guard, which has to throw a blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one right had not ordered him to throw it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday manning said that the previous night he had been forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he does not represent a danger for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning told, that said to the officer, I could use the waistband of the shorts or flip-flops, to injure himself, but he didn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, according to manning, his underwear, shoes and glasses away from the camera. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that the judge, at least, take into account the fact that he had suffered while in detention, and significantly reduce the duration of detention, in case, if manning will be convicted by the military court, which should begin consideration of his case in the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense claimed that plans to offer Manning admit guilt for less serious crimes, and other charges contest as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist on the fact that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon claims that manning was held in Quantico, in accordance with the rules governing the content of arrested persons with the most severe regime. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the accusations made Manning, were aiding the enemy, illegal promote the publication of data on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national defence, and the theft of state property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who have left, because they remind residents of the country of the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Наваретте believes that the Mexicans American origin are torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico city I walked down the hall for visitors, and drew near to the area of border control and froze on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to the two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second is for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I a few seconds, stood in front of them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just the code name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from new York consider themselves Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped at a complex structure, &quot;an American of Mexican origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need in conventional names or complex designs. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the bearers of the language, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I got my American passport, and stood in a queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White house and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda there were the usual for the meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, narcotics, and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> President Pena Nieto spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead of waking up in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the USA and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the President Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, however, no specific proposals were not heard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grudges question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see the reminder of the events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore it is only any statesman us understand one word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately hear complaints about the fact that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex is the relationship of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about insults? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people, who find in this country for themselves of the opportunity, and those for whom there is no such possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San-Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for one reason only: at some point in their family history who-either the father or grandfather had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> More often it was the Mexicans of a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from a poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember this. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and settled on the good work, but we should not forget the fact that even this dream is the American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination of confusing and it is not clear, but we know which country consider their own. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States Of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We tell them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as to the real Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them is due to failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We shouldn&apos;t have been now for a silk curtain, found in the us, full of life, but have lost spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in the early childhood, and it reminds me of the fact that between the Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there is some friction, Mexicans clearly aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin which is a shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> It is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both of these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> But in the us we are called Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations without enough confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore the relationship with the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans of Mexican origin have worked a kind of the ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends, the Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen the links with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will come of it. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many wrongs in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rampant corruption and drug-trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but I&apos;ll leave that to it, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If part of the Mexicans still can&apos;t forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they would have to take and the fact that some Americans are of Mexican origin still resent the fact, as recently in Mexico did to their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle on the new middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The agreement on cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas can be a fragile Foundation for the future of the world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is it possible to have a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes one to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound that became habitual, meaningless debate about who started it; many of the buildings were turned into ruins; killed over 140 Palestinians, most of which were civilians, and six of Israel; for the first time during the conflict, issued by Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel tel-Aviv and the Holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in its age-old conflict in the middle East there came a change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To that can be treated differently, but the events of &quot;Arab spring&quot; circled in the breakaway Bure many of the established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis could not stay away from the vortex, devastated region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the current situation does not give reasons for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a cease-fire, agreement on which was signed on 21 November, will be carried out that have occurred this week collision only strengthened the position of security officials from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007. declare that they have forced Israel to retreat, in spite of the incurred losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In spite of the fact that some leaders of the groups have been destroyed, and the 1.7 million residents are locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact Hamas growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan river - another Palestinian-controlled territory at the present time the more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> A resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which once had been the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, has acted with the support of the Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing States of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The triumphant supporters of Hamas declare the creation of around Israel Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the North, ruled by a paramilitary group Hezbollah, and Syria, in which all the more происламистские insurgents now overthrown the power of Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the power of the king threaten allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Mohammed Mursi strengthened the influence of Muslim Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt in the course of 30 years and was overthrown in 2011. was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention to the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Brothers-the Muslims, on the contrary, are an organization that is largely consistent with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future diplomatic representation Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice is not able to drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, proponents of the &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In the military sense of Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defense system &quot;Iron dome&quot; justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanging position; many European countries have also laid the blame for the start of the latest round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> In spite of the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the walls, which comes on the West Bank of the Jordan river - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of the Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressively minded conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What is the point to pander to the Palestinians and to give them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If to give in their hands all the power in the West Bank, wouldn&apos;t they run from there rockets in the direction of Israel, as do their counterparts in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and brutally suppressing any attempt to lift her head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps, the supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> At that, the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problem. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense portion of the budget of Israel, more than in all of its Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with the regional superpower will hardly help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, which together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign and could well mark the beginning of a change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, to a lesser extent, to take into account the long-term consequences of their policies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As of democratic change in the Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later explode on the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus, blown up in tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only compounding the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody operations, which are conducted every few years on the territory of the Gaza strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay a growing dissatisfaction of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need for the external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> There remains only one solution, to which constantly call sensible representatives from both sides, and also a great part of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States, and the assignment of Israel territories in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> There is a hope, not too impressive in the short term, &quot; the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which has long it&apos;s time to take the decision to block arms supplies to the Gaza strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as never before, the best position to persuade Hamas recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, taking into account the exchange of the territories, and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the forthcoming voting in the UN, the result of which may be a recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he had not presented its own plan for a peaceful settlement. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White house he still demonstrates unwillingness to connect to the solution of this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is catastrophically short-sighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in the stability of the middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia came into force the law of generic packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the dangers of Smoking and the image of the affected diseases of the parts of the body contrastly allocated on a dull green boxes that are the same for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice the Australian law on the same type of pack cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colour design of different brands of the same box sadly-olive color with horrible pictures of affected parts of the body and images of children, the health of which undermined Smoking their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of Smoking, the only difference between batches, permission to move in a mandatory manner with this Sabbath - brand names, which is printed the same small font. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe in the world of conditions for registration of the packages of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure is to keep the youth from Smoking, depriving them of the habit of fashion status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for such a decision on the results of research showing that people who do not started Smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is clear that even at the young age of the children understand the meaning of, who are trying to bring the tobacco companies with the help of package decoration&quot;, - explained the Minister of health Tanya Плиберсек, citing a study showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world share of smokers, so that this change is not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of the adoption of such measures have been considered and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and affordable cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences different from those who think its initiators&quot;, - says Scott MacIntyre, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha from a small family company u Import Pty Ltd confirms that demand for cigarette cases, silicone cases, to hide unpleasant picture on the package, grew rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where tried to appeal against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra Ha, the company u already sold about six thousand products wholesale trade and expects of the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among exactly the part of the population addressed by these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption in Australia a number of laws that made illegal the television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting activities, as well as prohibiting the sellers of the display of cigarettes in a prominent place, the advertising of tobacco products has moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government banned the local companies and web sites to place advertising in the network, but it may not restrict in this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you trade in tobacco products and you still had only a small loophole, the idea to promote your product on the Internet you will find very attractive,&quot; says Becky Freeman, we investigate the questions of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of the alleged common users in social networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question arises - is it really the hands of the average citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes, which did not spare time and energy and made a video, or does it stands for an advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of the British American Tobacco company claims that the industry is now more interested in adapting to the new rules, than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went so far as to measures such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: the state claims in the framework of the world trade organization, claiming that the trade was subjected to unjust restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries, with Australia are very insignificant. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Плиберсек, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of making them similar laws on the package. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, the Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of Smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> It is now generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening of laws considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia defiantly not obey innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures I do not hurt. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just do not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just выхватываешь cigarette, and hide the pack in his pocket&quot;, - explains Victor El Haig, buying cigarettes with a photograph of tumors of the oral cavity on the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Chairman, head of a shop of tobacco products King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package is added to the complexity of the task of placement of goods on shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before I had the unloading of the new party one hour, and now, four hours,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have taken and altogether ban cigarettes, then we could say: what do we do, well, it&apos;s over, close the shop,&quot; says he, throwing his hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it&apos;s not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane was revealed mechanical problem and it was replaced by another aircraft, which the we and were waiting for. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day in the airport waiting for a flight - this is really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines, or iPhone, or even the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> However, in recent years more and more scientists and specialists on child development were in favour of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say, that in certain situations for us and for our children will not be bored so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain distracted by the interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because in today&apos;s world we all are continually before some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us by. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> May be we need to strive for boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time, no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We&apos;ll get back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Before I, like many others, felt that boredom is the invention of a relatively recent times, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> This is not so, argues Peter Toon, Professor of Greek and Roman history of the canadian University of calgary, and is the author of the Fascinating history of boredom&quot; (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii were found Latin inscriptions of boredom, Dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> This leaves open the question of how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D.. Eastwood, adjunct Professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the boredom often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied the materials of the research on this topic and question the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom - this is when people &quot;want, but cannot deal that would give them the satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people are not doing something that I would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy do anything you do not want. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main facing boredom, he says, is a &quot;violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in the mood and the feeling that time runs slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> On the description of boredom may seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood argues that in spite of a possible connection between these States, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, they see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just difficult to something to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study of &quot;Idle mind: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention&quot;, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, the participants listened to a recording of voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard a loud sound is not relevant to the case of the television program, included in the next room, others have heard the same sound at a low volume, so that they can just barely be made out, and the third group only listened to a voice recording without the sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants, who have heard the TV with a low level of volume, noted that they were bored, more often than the others - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to concentrate on challenging or exciting task, interrupt attention may cause boredom, says mark J.. Фенске, associate Professor of neurology at the University of Гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something going on, &quot;for example, looking at the flow of items on the Assembly line in the search of marriage, diverting music can help avoid boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he continues, that when people begin to sway in the chair or doodling on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply help you not to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The study showed that children who do not prohibit the sway and turn round, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit still,&quot; says Professor Фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching interesting movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However, different people have shown varying degrees of inclination to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s, for the measurement of such individual characteristics, the researchers developed a special &quot;scale propensity to boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To evaluate on such a scale is used questions and approval of, for example, &quot;Much of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonically&quot; or &quot;Me too much interesting, so anything is missing time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires the researchers determined that the boys are bored more often than girls, &quot; said Steven Воданович, a Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly in the presence of various external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However, in General, adolescents are often missed. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991. Reed Larson, Professor of the personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, during which he was associated with a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He obtained the following results: 32% of young people declared that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they get bored outside of the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> While only 3% of the parents indicated that they are bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that it does not have data about what would be similar data about the boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, he knows that &quot;in adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom&quot;, mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully solve than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because of the extreme manifestations of it, as studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, the risk of gambling or the abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, &quot; says Professor Воданович, who devoted to the study of this problem for over two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us that we should do something else; this is boring,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at new York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However, the brain doesn&apos;t always know what exactly it is better to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you will be bored and you will direct this energy to play the guitar or the culinary experiments, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you are watching TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Therefore, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it will no longer be bored, but he does not learn to fight boredom independently or as otherwise manage your time and employment, &quot; says Professor Фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And these are the skills of self-regulation are utilized in the most different situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns to not only occupy yourself with something, he also learns self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that boredom has to be praised. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, consider it as something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of a continuous flow of action and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agree with this. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see this so that we should more often be bored with the fact that boredom is extremely unpleasant, неутолимое desire to do something meaningful&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to somehow disconnected from the constant worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses, &quot; he says, &quot; and when there is silence, we get lost and do not know what to do&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> While it is unclear how it will be applied the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player of the football team and the student community College in the South-East of the state of Colorado accused of committing criminal offenses in the fact that soon there will be absolutely legally on the territory of the state: the storage of a small portion of marijuana and tubes, in which it smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that one day in September he and his friends was in Lamare and rode in the car on the Prairie near the border with Kansas, where they were stopped by the police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for drug possession and possession of equipment for drug - minor offences, for each of which is owed to a fine in the amount of $ 100 - and fixed the date of the court session. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals&quot;, - says Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But the offender does it? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of uncertainty, which has continued for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law as from the place of consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The charges in the minor offences associated with marijuana, is already removed in the hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which adopted a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have ceased to press charges people at the age of 21 years and older for the storage of small doses, which will be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to consider the existing cases, associated with marijuana, and still prosecuted for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in some cities, the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West vote for it, to prevent it in their places of new, state-licensed shops for sale of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is developing so fast that I didn&apos;t know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J.. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the East of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of controlling bodies in the state of Washington also puzzled scratching their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They have to create rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this should be done before 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, Colorado, is this good or bad, is ahead of most other States in resolving the issues of the use of marijuana, the first in the medical purposes, and now for the fun of. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example&quot;, &quot; explains Brian. Smith, a representative of the Council for the regulation of the production and marketing of alcoholic products in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no-one can do more, recognizes Mr. Smith, than to put forward some proposals, and I hope that this will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent on which we could focus&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill of the state of Washington, called the I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and for the whole year will plunge the state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing of yet, but the right of possession of marijuana is legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are in fact more complicated technical aspects, which need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the order of the state of &quot;adequate&quot; access to a covered marijuana with a ban on the trade at a distance of 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Particularly difficult to place a licensed enterprise on trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs&quot;, &quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group &quot;the Center of the legalization of marijuana&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> on November 21, the chief of police Oates from the Aurora sent his subordinates to an e-mail message that the Prosecutor&apos;s office of the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years, to liability for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops incriminate people in these violations &quot;from this moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The chief of police Oates said that the police will monitor the observance of the city of rules regulating the activity of the persons, who have been growing marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The district attorney Weald in the North of Colorado, Ken Tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that the Prosecutor&apos;s office will continue to attract the responsibility for marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage the use of its individuals undergo a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment 119 persons charged with possession of two and less than ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and to other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of our institutions - be prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the moment of their execution&quot;, - said Mr. Tank in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reaction was mixed, even in places such as rural district Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal by the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police Grand junction, the largest city in the County, was no longer attractive to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The district attorney Pete Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges and in the cases associated with the storage of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that ensure the compliance with the law, until he will not change is our direct duty&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, who took part in the voting, have supported this decision, the inclusion of questions about the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> A contradictory reaction of inhabitants in different places of the state highlighted the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to experiment a state with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The district attorneys in this matter there is a cultural barrier&quot;, &quot; explains Sean McAllister, Denver lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National organization for reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have long pursued the people behind this is that now cannot really accept the fact that it is not a crime&quot;, - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first States in which a small quantity of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Supporters of the legalization and officials of the state plan to enlarge the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time, they anxiously await instructions from the Federal authorities, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a Federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of justice of the yield in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several have received a wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the Federal government in the majority of cases, gave the nod to the trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau on struggle with drug is unlikely to be breaking into homes to confiscate small bag of marijuana, but they hardly will turn a blind eye on regulated by the authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, believes Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some of the city in Colorado not wait for the actions of the Federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential elections, some of the local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, who are not able to open earlier than in a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week Монтроуз, a town in the Western part of the state, put forward for the consideration of the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, most likely, will be approved at the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to be in a position that we will give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the Federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city has voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and thus, for which voted the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There is still a great many unresolved issues. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Петронелла Уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I am a conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Persecution of students from universities for their opinions began not today. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As long as I can remember, I always wanted to do in the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and elder brother had studied at Oxford and have described it as the best institution in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient Symposium, закладывающий two of the foundations of civilization - free-thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And yet, after two weeks of study at the faculty of history at Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I Packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke down and wept. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Newspaper The Evening Standard said that I dropped out of College because I didn&apos;t like that my classmates are having sex in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The Writer Of E. Wilson joked that I went, because I had to drink from the chipped cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> In fact, everything was not so funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran away, because I systematically persecuted and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> All men have hunted me for only one reason, and in this the famous cradle of enlightenment it looked like this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Уайэтт, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You ask, why talk about it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, the new generation of students, adhering to center-right views, is subject to the same persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> This institutionalized and continuously growing hatred of the students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong, that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that which is provided to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The conservatives from the students &apos; club of the College of Corpus Christi in Cambridge claim that they &quot;are often very isolated and subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwelcome guests&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to enter in the Committee on equal rights of the College of additional representative, to ensure the freedom of expression. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation only worsened the recently released on BBC 2 documentary film about the policy in the student&apos;s environment &quot;Country of miracles: young, intelligent and right&quot;, in which the conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The film was shown Joe cook, former President of the Association of conservatives, University of Oxford, who goes around in a rolls-Royce, is a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students-conservatives complain that it is being made a &quot;scapegoat because of the increase of fees for study&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke black, 20 years old, the Vice-President of the Association of conservatives, University of Nottingham, in an interview to one of the Sunday Newspapers said that &quot;in the University environment increases the bias in favor of the left-wing views. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People who we don&apos;t even know in advance we are arrogant and with impunity rowdy children of wealthy parents&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student of the historical faculty of the College of Corpus Christi, which had filed a petition for protection, calls this atmosphere of &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Черилл, 19 years, the new President of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club of the media center-right views deteriorated significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This constitutes a threat as for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and just for the normal life of the members of the club,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I went there in September 1986, timid and shy eighteen year old girl. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Oxford fever from hatred of the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> For the year to the University of voting deprived former student of Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree from the budget cuts to higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the early days of the week of freshman, when the students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time, what was waiting for me ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I did not know that the teachers are not only looking through your fingers to the persecution of students-conservatives, but also yourself with pleasure took part in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues - the miners &apos; strike, the privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa is penetrated the trimmed with wood-paneled walls audiences. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> On my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century the English, and I was not ready to the fact that followed it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Уайэтт, &quot; said the teacher, the late Harry pitt, &quot; please, turn first paragraph&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text given to me with difficulty, I stammered. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry pitt was a very bitter man with a face like a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Тэтчеристы fundamentally do not learn French or they simply did not have enough brains?&quot; &quot;he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I have brought tears to his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise You to take some initial lessons of the French in your free time, if You will, of course, not very busy, away from the society&quot;, - said the voice testily pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room, quite miserable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> In the evening in the College, I was sitting at dinner one; then someone tapped me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, a student of the second course of the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are, &quot; he said pleasantly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Unfortunately, the situation is as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> over every person suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives, will scoff. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> The majority of first-year students-conservatives pretending they labour&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in the local pub, I timidly tried to play the hypocrite. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that he does not agree with all that said Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The trick failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> First-year student of the faculty of philosophy, politics and Economics, who himself was educated at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You&apos;re contagious&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was damaged, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How conservatives have sex? &quot;One of them asked. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;They beat each other, right?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt as should be, feel homosexuals to abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Will I be forced to become лейбористкой and hide their true beliefs? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The upcoming me three years were hell, full of persecution and loneliness. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher in my College, spared his conservative views, was Norman stone, Professor of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher on the issues of foreign policy and one of its speech writers. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In College, he practically did not appear. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him for provincialism, pettiness and commitment to Marxist-deterministic view of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a professorial position at the University of Билкент in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you won&apos;t be happy&quot;, - he said to me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased view of the capital&apos;s friends. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He did not believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his training in the forties were adopted there any political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best University in the world, &quot; he said plaintively. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> - There are not capable of, not only in the city of dreaming spires... </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends-the Communists had always behaved perfectly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His moist eyes clouded. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Don&apos;t take hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I&apos;m sure this is just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You break my heart, if you drop the University&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was exhausted constant trips to London and my emotional protection of the weak. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and refused from their beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> Next week during the seminar, when the history teacher was seriously called me a &quot;public enemy&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In the soul burning with shame, I admitted that &quot;I brainwashed parents&quot;, and called them &quot;the old fool&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time it every week wrote to two columns for publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I did not go out, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they were gone, I Packed my suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can call me плаксой and cloth. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years, no one should be subject to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only has released fourteen of the Prime Ministers of the tories, but to this day, hiding the undeserved reputation of the University in which the value of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest profession in the world: the miners with Qavah-Иджена </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four Euro Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, hauling 70 kilograms of sulfur at the top of the volcano on the steep rocky trails </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work is hell, while others literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them Анто Vijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living extraction of sulfur in the volcano Qavah-Иджен, located in the East of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day Анто down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens in contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Breaking off a huge chunks of sulphur, total weight of which can reach up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on his shoulders and carries them up the steep stony road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Up to the top of the volcano, the height of which is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted the laborers are required more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail&apos;s pace, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully picking a way to not trip and fall over a cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them their life, as it happened with one tourist from France, which collapsed a few years ago from the rocks Qavah-Иджена. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners with Qavah-Иджена earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur, which is </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once on top, they are paving their way among the tourists that they are photographed, as if they were apes from the circus, and, tired of carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about SA Kandy Нгримби, the company, which operates since 1960, the volcano, and it is better not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for around 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) petrochemical industries, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each separate raids&quot;, &quot; explains us Анто, which usually carries out three daily carrying. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels shattered, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 Euro) to the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems мизером for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Daily wage miners is very high by local standards, where for the collection of coffee pay of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 EUR) &quot;, - explains the porter, who had previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There his salary was 75.000 rupees (6,2 Euro) per day, and the plot was not so heavy, but Анто returned with his family in Баньюванги, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where some of the Hindus, and brought her to Java, so she accepted Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Анто asthma, he breathed with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes from the toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In his 27 years Анто spent three years, risking themselves in Qavah-Иджене, sulfur which has already begun to affect him in spite of the presence of a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathed with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes from the toxic gases, which allocates the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> That is the price he must pay for the accomplishment of your dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French&quot;, - he promises to more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or the Concierge at the hotel, but instead, he performs the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o&apos;clock, because sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns to blue and shines in darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> To challenge the shadows, Анто down into the crater, lighting up their way a little lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters carry the basket of gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profit, the mining company has not механизировала production of sulfur for cost savings and does not provide any equipment porters, who are working at their own expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not receive even a part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) fee for photography, which, together with the entrance ticket for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of the reserve charged to tourists, who come to take photos of the volcano and its people-mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for the cattle, and not for the people,&quot; says Бадрусин, a porter 42 years old, who spent at Qavah-Иджене three decades, ever since I left College. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable to carry up to 110 kilograms, he assures that will endure work &quot;as much as he can,&quot; because he needed the money for the education of their three children at the age from 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Not going to retire, die here, because the volcano is all my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burns my throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the solid pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their habitual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on his shoulders, which buckled under the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing a basket on his back, Унайник now only can lift 50 pounds in its 53-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his comrades make 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transported to a warehouse in Тамансари, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers down the narrow path among the thickets. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;Not going to retire, die here, because the volcano is all my life,&quot; says Унайник, mouth wide open, which is missing several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, is also carrying sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what do human mules with Qavah-Иджена. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans are accused career, stress, and prices for housing and education in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore, should grow up&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> My husband is a patriot, you are my wife so she&apos;s Patriotic, fulfill our civil duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising peppermints, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of this - this video has been a big hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of the rap, which uses the local sayings like &quot;Let&apos;s put Bao (roll) in the stove&quot;, to laugh at the level of birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising Agency, which has made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to attract attention to this problem in an entertaining form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of the music that people have fulfilled &quot;its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world for the reproduction of their own kind, so we felt that this is a topic that we need to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government attempted to do a lot of things, such as the launching of perfume with pheromones or organize a party of fast Dating (blitz-Dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily work. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why don&apos;t we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, but it is compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1,2 child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not take it so lightly, so that the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends of 1,300 us dollars a year on the policy for encouragement of citizens to the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for couples and parents provides to 15,000 dollars for a child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this is of low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore - it is a rich and high-tech state-city in South-East Asia, also known conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national office for the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, Director of the policy for couples and families the National authority for the population, says that the reason for the &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;over a wide range of career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This allowed people to have a more wide range of options in regard to the life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and creating a family,&quot; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and postponing marriage and the birth of children, as a result of which decreased the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is directed to a sharp increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore there are web sites where commercial barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, which criticized for the maintenance of wages at a low level and a reluctance to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in the elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While a falling birth rate exerts a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, costs for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making effort to be built so many small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it&apos;s beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Guide urban development passed to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;Shoe box&quot;, which can be build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments an area of 46 square meters are sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion, that they may contribute to the single way of life and deprive incentive developers who want to build a large family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But lim Yu Xun, Director General of the house of the company EL Developers, says that their &quot;Shoe boxes&quot; are sold much more quickly than the more spacious instances. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are sold in a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartment size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result of that, our cash flows are increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he admits that the new regulations provide more explicit guidance for developers, who had put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too перенапряженные </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of increase in the national birth rate, after a conversation with сингапурцами who work in the financial district of the centre, it seems that they will have no effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very перенапряжены, housing is expensive, as well as the formation, and because of this, many people are postponed&quot;, - says a young Manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention his career, stress, and prices for housing and education as the main reasons, which prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, how would the government or tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in regard to the birth, the last word remains for the сингапурцами. </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that this кибермоббинг&quot;, - confirms it. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Марьелос Поррас, teacher of English and a specialist in education and training, considers that, in order to guide children and teenagers need to understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was introduced as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game&quot;, - she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Поррас indicates that the academician of the mark Пренски, master of pedagogy of Yale University and is the author of Digital natives and immigrants, invented the terms for an explanation of this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives it is they, the children and young people, who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still do learn,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this issue is a complex one, &quot;because we have them we ask you to have a certain criteria that may or may not distribute, publish or speak, at an age when puberty is not enough for this&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also that they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what the confidentiality of children and adolescents, &quot; to ask questions, which make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Say to them that they did not do this, it is useless,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Поррас lists some of the options: there are things that you hadn&apos;t told the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, would you like it if published a photo you like the one that posted about you his friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign a photo with the parties, asking whether you permission from other people, to celebrate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another thing, does everybody need to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> One more point is to let them understand that they should conduct themselves online as well as doing it offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Outside of the Internet the person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so shall it be in social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>

<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,&quot; says he. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Гаурдия, the key question is to remind children a lesson &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an email message to the media with &quot;the final Declaration of the summit, however, it is all about the statement of Умалы, and not on the official document, which culminated in the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In the past October Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab countries (АСПА), and in that time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, too, has not been published so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international tribunals&quot;, - added Pinera, and greeted the shake of a hand Умалу on the background of the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Confirmation of both of the presidents of the fact that they submit to the International court of justice, occurred immediately after the Columbia appealed this week Боготский Pact, under which she acknowledged the subordination of the indictments of the international court of justice after the decision on the Maritime boundary with Nicaragua, which she thinks is wrong. </seg>

<seg id="2726"> Since Europe is in a crisis, &quot;economic Association (Latin America) should not be триумфаторской basis, and shall serve for the expansion of our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities,&quot; added Умала. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 important projects, which will improve the communication spaces of South America, in particular in rural and border areas... bringing our countries and forming new economic schemes,&quot; said Peruvian President to read the message. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he mentioned that the five refer to Peru, and limited transverse axes in its territory, from coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at larger relationship with Ecuador, however, he did not give more details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The outcome document touched upon the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations&quot;, from which it currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need to Latin America remain a region of well-being and the world would be United, and had good relations between neighbours, was another topic, emphasized by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before proceeding to participate in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico city for negotiations in good form on the Maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court of justice, contested in Bogota. </seg>

<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe in terms of integration of citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the &quot;South America, in this case, Yes, should learn from Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, said state television Peru, that the Europeans killed each other during the Second world war and other conflicts, &quot;but now they are essentially the same Fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this context, the project for the South American citizenship, which approves of the countries-participants (UNASUR). </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;You need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers on any South American country, as is already happening with the members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sector who want to return us to the past&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Ecuadorian President showed himself, in addition, the proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the impact of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account of those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who read lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South American, on the contrary, sign all. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;Inexplicable that the inter-American Commission on human rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum, the Ecuador founder of WikiLeaks Julian Ассанжу. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that they do not regret this decision, because he never betrayed his principles and comply with the &quot;deep values of democracy and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that in his time &quot;there were some suspicions that the Assange be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about an alleged crime of sexual violence, while &quot;the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it by means of video conferencing, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not talked to him since he arrived in our Embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> That really is, is a danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do the exercises in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of any individual,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa pointed out that the solution of the problems of asylum, as provided by Ассанжу from June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of guarantees of immunity to allow him to go in Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial bodies and stressed that the negotiations were in London on the search for solution of the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate on human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution of this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial organs, because the lawyer Assange, Balthazar Garzon, conducts a number of processes in the different European institutions&quot;, - he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And expressed the opinion that &quot;if Britain tomorrow give a guarantee of immunity, it will end&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if the USA, as her perfectly to the legislation and as it has done in other cases, ask them Senora Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or to interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow the problem is solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as the defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, dishonesty and lies, which distort the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The main enemies of press freedom is not spoiled by the villains policy, and bad journalists, supporting the bait, blackmail and extortion&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect he was pleased with that have neither of these journalists, &quot;neither banks, nor bourgeois countries-hegemons not prevail in Ecuador&quot;, and added that, being re-elected, &quot;deepen the revolution to continue the development in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legality&quot;because, in reality, &quot;it has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Ecuadorian President considered, in addition, a &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot; the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos conduct talks now with Nicaragua on the Maritime boundary between the two countries after the decision of the International court of justice at the Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan Maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment this decision is not complied with. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they should be overcome desire to go together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> You need to handle them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed hope for a good ending a dispute concerning the Maritime boundary, which lead to the same court, Peru and Chile, and has stated that &quot;the right to Latin America to appeal to international courts, if the two countries agree to take a decision, no matter how difficult it might be. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> About the opportunity to speak as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it&apos;s pretty hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has assured, that if defeated in the elections in February 2013, they&apos;ll get away from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement considered, what exactly am I guaranteed that the probable victory, so you have to accept the responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In case of a victory that would have been my last term in office of the President, and then we go out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This decision&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mention the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to therapy, which had already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that it will campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean aggravation of the health condition of President Chavez,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of the Ecuadorian state has participated today in Lima in the VI summit of heads of States and governments of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he announced that his analysis of the AIDS gave a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I was stunned,&quot; - he recalls the difficult, in spite of all the tact of a doctor, the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man kept it secret from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts are justified he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients HIV-branches of the hospital, the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with a diagnosis of &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (HIV) since 22 years. In the beginning of 90-ies it would be hard to believe - too little then exist treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased attitude to the patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> So, even the Director of the Mexican Institute of social security did not want to say good-bye to him, &quot;for he was cut&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those times have AIDS was a sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive in this syndrome and to do this without compromising the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, not knowing about his illness, are still many people come, when the virus has already caused the damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first of the cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is the fact that the survival of the patient, who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in the same&quot;, - said the head of the HIV-office HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information has been confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectious disease specialist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists came to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, however, the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, the better the life expectancy of those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years with a total number of 200 CD4 + t-cells, and up to 50 years, when informed of the 500 CD4 + t-cells. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that the one who gets the diagnosis of a HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, to be able to live without any problems up to 75 years&quot;, - he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To evaluate this progress, it should be recalled that the duration of life of Mexicans today is at an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> While the mortality rate has decreased considerably in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of the UNAIDS), it is also true that from the moment of the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by may of this year; however, it is submitted that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs by 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why there are still lethal outcomes? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I see it, this is the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years we have not been a lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected state, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He cited the devastating to: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunistic infections; what you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so it is diagnosed at an early stage, and therefore it is necessary to submit samples for the detection of on a massive scale, for all the people who are asked to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal converge in opinion of experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in a private laboratory, побужденный only the fact that it was a friend of his, and in spite of his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some people think that they will die, and did not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Time will still die, I will be better надираться three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I eat well, do the exercises, take pills. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents only know that he suffered cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of classes, I&apos;m travelling, lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of myself and other people&quot;, - enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO, JALISCO, to coerce his statement of those who now, in the context of the world AIDS day, feels fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let checked if there was a risk of intrusion, he shall as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV-positive, so much the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This is his message sums up the theme of fight against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Female condom over the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Great abyss between programmes in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, who tackled the problem, related to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places, devoted to this task, &quot;in fact increased female condom provision, before we were given one or two, we now offer packages at one hundred, and that&apos;s very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still does not have access to презервативу&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why would you need them?&quot; this is a popular question, with malice and condemnation on the part of social workers, school counselors, staff of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I suggest to change the inefficient distribution; order female condom were not only behind the counters and to a hundred of them was in the vending machines in the public toilets in places frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This does not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> We are not talking about paying for the beer and the Motel, said the Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when he was asked whether it is possible distribution of презервативов with his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It&apos;s not sexy, it is best to make the female condom available for those who already practice of sexual activity&quot;, - he noted. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Registered 13,435 of total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state takes the 4th place in the national ranking under the new and the total cases of AIDS and 13-e by HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of infections are related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal way. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50 thousand people can live with HIV, so as on the one registered case there are from 4 to 5 people, who do not know about it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Considering the ratification of the court of appeal of the United States decisions, which Annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved by means of competitive production in Mexico, the script installs the fatal precedent for any national companies with branch offices in the neighbouring country, which has problems with solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In the practical sphere, approval of a decision by June 15 the judge Харлин Hale in the court of bankruptcy of the Northern district of Texas, leaves helpless Mexican firm in the face of possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>

<seg id="2836"> However, the ability to recognize the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first case when taken this scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There were half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive productions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that by subtracting the voice of the branches, one way or another lenders Vitro, which fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely funds &quot;vultures&quot; like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> These data the court of Appeal declined. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he blames Vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis, which overtook the United States, striking at the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> While the firm family Gonzalez Garden produces the appeal of the decision in the court of appeal, to the vote came to the plenary meeting, that is, five judges, in view of the fact that voted only three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the case of a failure of will be presented the petition on the document, which will require a revision of the process of the court of higher jurisdiction, in this case, the Supreme court of the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2846"> In addition, it is noted that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, the rules established for the cases of inter-state of insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2870"> And as before, the hemorrhage in a brain tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the Highest basketball League, the Commissioner and the head of taking the Cowboys Баямона and the President of the basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have done a lot of roles in the game of basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, like when I was President of the taking, Director General of the National team and the President of the Federation in the 90-ies,&quot; recalls Reyes during the visit of the Primera Hora to his home in Баямон, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is not exaggerating, making this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia from his long journey, testify to this. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Баямон in the heart of the </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the largest emotions he keeps those that remember his way through the Cowboys, since the middle of 50-ies as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years his speech on the role of co-agent or agent of the contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because he had the opportunity to be part of the eight Championships Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, the co-agent or supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of joy, including five Championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, in a year&apos;s debut Jerome Минси in taking. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> The time and continue to lead became &quot;cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator&quot;, &quot; said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Jean Бартов, who was here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot;I Have for you is a very strong player, growth of 6&apos;7&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Do you want to?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Минси, one of the best players that were in Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Бартов then recommend sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our top scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that I said that if Минси brought the championship Баямону, Gauss would have helped to win another one. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship Cowboys with Gauss I enjoyed, but already at a distance, because by 1988, was listed head of the Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements Минси in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember, as we won the first time, in the us at the time of the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the world championship 1990, on which we received the fourth place and it should be a bronze, if it were not for the canadian judge, which has forced us to beat the final game, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team with the 1990 FIFA world - this is the best team, you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the Olympic games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the one that with the pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and beat team USA, which was quite similar to that we have won bronze at the world championship. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In the team not only were playing again Минси, Gauss, Ramona Риваса, Fico Lopez and &apos;Пикулина&apos; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &apos;Тоньито&apos; colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &apos;Quixote&apos; Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us gold medal and great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament 1995, in Neuquen, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role-players like &apos;Канито&apos; Ньевеса, Pablo Алисеа and young Rolando Хурруитнера instead of players suspended for the mess in the pan-American championship in Mar del Plata, we won the gold in spite of all the forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without any doubt, it was Пикулин Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His performance on the international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico is not dominated at this level as it did Пикулин. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this is without accounting of his career in a variety of leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best leader of the Puerto Rican kid? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a very complicated question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good young, including Julio Toro, flora Мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond Далмау, Армандито Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> From young, I really like the work of Leo Ариллы. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you think is your greatest achievement in the Federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that, in the beginning of 90-ies in taking was to 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you have to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were some things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalisation of the smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to see the boys from Ponce only played in their area, and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the guys travel and play too much, and it&apos;s unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I see the fruits of obligatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I mostly listen to music, watch music videos my time on YouTube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go to the basketball matches. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me. </seg>

<seg id="2961"> Each week students explore the apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> In this semester, when a Professor of religion Stewart Charm decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible attraction: the end of the &quot;long countdown&quot; of the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which caught many people as in the proof of what is to come the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane sandy, the financial crisis, which some call &quot;долгоармагеддоном&quot;, and the growing conflict, where retracted Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times believe that the start of the Apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I was not aware that this would be the most apocalyptic semester of them all,&quot; said the Charm of this week, the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (new Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that the bad is good for those who have apocalyptic way of thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only Professor, which offers courses on the theme of &quot;the end of the world&quot; in this semester, theoretically the last in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Темпльском University adjunct Professor Barry Вакер reads the course &quot;media, culture and the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We look at why these ideas eventually apply&quot;, - he said, and the way that offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain actions of a man. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material will get into the hands of terrorists, for example, can generate a war. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> In this month the students analyzed the movies on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they correlate with examples from real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell the students about what is possible, probably, plausible, and it is impossible&quot;, - said Вакер. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania Professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Ресталл and his colleague Amara Solari, associate Professor of art history and anthropology, have come together to read the course, which is simply called &quot;the End of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012&apos;, so that you always have the opportunity to read the course again, in the case if the end of the world will not come,&quot; said Ресталл. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In spite of the &quot;imminent destruction,&quot; students should learn, prepare projects and submit the final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work &quot;to that very night, in which supposedly the end of the world&quot;, said Ресталл. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Courses were very popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;The place ended in two hours&quot;, - said Ресталл about his course for students with a high average score, on which signed up 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received e-mail messages in the course of many weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who are asking, is there another place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, in turn, certify that this course one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I like to watch what people do to console himself,&quot; said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the separation of religion and the sociology of Хаддонфилда, new Jersey, Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Векеса, 25-year-old student of the Department of psychology and nursing, said that watched all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I have never heard about the course, which would have taught it,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I like it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the Professor is not said, that he believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project involved the prophecy of the Maya, and in some way we his discredited&quot;, - said Julie Зеглен, 21-year-old student of the last course in Темпльском University of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said Ресталл. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in the Western culture, which dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around him, predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places, people do not think about it&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In a predominantly English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Doherty, Professor of religion University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether, if he knows about any course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; out there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, referring to an order of a higher court. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have shown from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Ресталл noticed that for a long time discussed the many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing is going to happen on December 21, &quot;people will immediately begin to think about the next date&quot; or philosophize that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers blithely refer to this date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Some said that they are going to go to a party &quot;the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe I&apos;ll call one of your friends, to laugh together,&quot; said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student of the faculty of communication. </seg>
