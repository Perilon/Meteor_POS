<seg id="96"> In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="97"> You are here or with your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="98"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="99"> You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to turn it into the &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot; to choose. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work. </seg>
<seg id="101"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched on as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Jamef Bwelle was founded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured. </seg>
<seg id="103"> First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation of the brain, and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="105"> We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="107"> &quot;It is not easy,&quot; Bwelle commented. </seg>
<seg id="108"> You can leave the house at five o &quot;clock in the morning and go to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There are very many patients. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Some people even die because they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="113"> On the other hand, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But even if it were a doctor, could afford most Cameroonians to visit. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private. </seg>
<seg id="116"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="118"> His father and to see so many of his countrymen suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 operations last year. </seg>
<seg id="120"> He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="121"> He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels on weekends in rural areas, and it offers free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unprerpared terrain in the villages who need help. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not everything runs smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="125"> More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="126"> But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages is free medical care is a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyous celebration. </seg>
<seg id="128"> The next morning, the team begins with the examination of hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="129"> &quot;We are treating 500 people per trip,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="130"> You come from a 60 mile radius of the village - and on foot. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of these weekend clinics provide medical care in a number of areas. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Other crutches donated glasses or receive free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the evening, the team simply operations with local anaesthetic. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations are normally held in a school, town house or an apartment, after the procedure, patients on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is powered by the generator of the group and Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is a very exhausting work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="138"> &quot;They drum throughout the night, so that we remain awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students know last year - has carried out 700 operations and that they had to work a huge difference for the people it helps. </seg>
<seg id="141"> One man said that the free operation RAEC Mons, which he had received, he is allowed to return to work. </seg>
<seg id="142"> &quot;That changed the future of my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="143"> In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle at night in private clinics in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job finance 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations. </seg>
<seg id="145"> &quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O &quot;Malley, who for the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medical and nursing students such as O &quot;Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We can be in operations, where we help, blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explains O &quot;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would be in America as a medical student in the second year will never be possible. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring often donated medical equipment. </seg>
<seg id="151"> However, they are in Yaounde, Bwelle accommodation, transportation and guide. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;He is without doubt a hero,&quot; says O &quot;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> He devotes his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Others to give to a happier life and a promise that he made his father, he is a great pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I am so happy when I make this work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I am thinking of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope he sees what I do. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain. </seg>

<seg id="161"> Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="162"> Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22, appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are the ones who choose a Pope Francis, in order to nominate the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> There are currently 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, no longer participate in the pope&apos;s election, a group of 120 &quot;cardinals&quot; to voters. </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a statement in which the news was known, said Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, it will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, who is also known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="167"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to give its decision in February to convene the projects run by known in advance, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will be dropped until February. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He explained that a pope usually take as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voting cardinals in 120, and so many cardinals over the age of 80, as he wants. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty% of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council, founded by Francis to cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past, the Pope decided everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Francis has selected these eight cardinals who will help him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that would ask Francis to cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="178"> But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Valero said that the bishops would typically refer to great places to Cardinals, but Francis was &quot;full of surprises - so we do not know whom he appoints.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="185"> Europe&apos;s elite is willing to do business with the United Kingdom? </seg>
<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for wealth and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders in the British company sizes, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The results of the survey will surprise many. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focuses on countries that modernize and grow, while the states are stagnant in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Do you wish the government new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are promoted, instead of the long and exhausting process of reforming the arcane EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Asked about their views on specific legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="193"> There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, because according to the company&apos;s benefits outweigh the costs of Brussels regulations has to be part of Europe&apos;s trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally the most Europhile. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a significant majority of Great Britain a course towards the revision of the agreement, and a relationship with the EU, which is based on commerce, not politics. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This realization that is used in businesses of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is in a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings back to the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="196"> It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would be at 16 percent, a change of view in favor of the agreement of the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The prime minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK&apos;s conditions for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows that companies expect from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving toward closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey, which means for companies to pay more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the approach to rules in Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="445"> One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, was now being discovered. </seg>
<seg id="446"> The U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter wide touch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they had ever found. </seg>
<seg id="447"> The tunnel, which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of six football fields, linking warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA. </seg>
<seg id="448"> In the area, there are countless unassuming warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The tunnel had been closed before the drugs could be transported to the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="450"> With the discovery of the tunnel had been eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the records of the court. </seg>

<seg id="457"> Foreign workers on 457 visas could be &quot;Echtheits Test&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> The government is considering additional measures in the framework of a &quot;Echtheits test&quot; for foreign workers with a 457 visa. </seg>
<seg id="459"> The test should be introduced, it would amount to a criterion that is used to prevent the 457 occupation by unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Today, the government published a proposal for discussion after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who denounced the government&apos;s comments on foreign workers, because they could be viewed by the neighbours of Australia as an insult. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;Vocal declarations like, foreigners should stand back&quot; and &quot;first of all, Australians are a very unpalatable fallback in times when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Historically, it was reported that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region vernaehmen an echo of this historic artifact, it would not surprise me. </seg>
<seg id="463"> The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Immigration minister Brendan O &quot;Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered. </seg>
<seg id="465"> If the &quot;Echtheits criterion&quot; is accepted, it could be someone who applied for a visa to be reviewed to see whether the motion &quot;is really in the cases where the applicant is associated with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company, or in person.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, as in the past, companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers, as hundreds have stopped. </seg>

<seg id="488"> A vignette is a &quot;flat rate for frequent driving and thus environmentally counterproductive,&quot; said the SPD negotiator for the transport issue, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group. </seg>
<seg id="489"> It threatened to dodge traffic on roads that are already black spots. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The introduction of a toll for all cars would be Pronolds also only a first step. </seg>

<seg id="524"> My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late allowed and dress for the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Today, I have become more like a Halloween muffle. </seg>
<seg id="526"> In the last two years, I have not declared ready to distribute candy from my apartment, and it will not do so this year. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep for Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (simultaneously). </seg>
<seg id="529"> Another thing that I am pleased every Halloween, but again, the trend values. </seg>

<seg id="534"> According to Google, the most sought-after costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition. </seg>
<seg id="536"> Last year, we have covered our dogs and were not alone in my amazement. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Indeed, Americans give $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, which simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="538"> There are a lot of &quot;hot dogs.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="545"> That is about nine billion maize grains. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It is a mystery that I still could not resolve. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Halloween is nothing more than houses where it haunts. </seg>
<seg id="548"> They have great names such as &quot;terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which, incidentally, in a real prison), &quot;howl - O - Scream&quot; and &quot;House of Shock.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="549"> There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States who make $500 million proceeds, America Haunts, which includes the wonderful photos, on which they soon into the trousers and the friends on Facebook, where it will not be rid of them again, and then the guy, which is to leave a comment like &quot;nice expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="550"> Finally, we come to the pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great War, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something that we have made. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Fortunately, the &quot;baby&quot; trend in the pumpkin only last year, thanks to Villepinte rest, so that most of us have grown up with it, not the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and to sit in it. </seg>

<seg id="574"> &quot;He has been paying for these circles and may lead to the arrest of a normal life,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="576"> The Labor Party against the former minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is initiated an investigation by the state anti-corruption supervision. </seg>
<seg id="577"> The disputed former NSW minister, changed the rules to the Tim Verpachtung at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden stakes in three plots of land controlled by the state. </seg>
<seg id="578"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday has extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid has influenced a number of government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a cafe, without prolonging tender after their expiration in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="579"> It is now investigating the allegation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land, after former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole Tripodis testified on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="580"> In years of talks, which began in 2005, had urged the government to public tenders for the leases. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Tenants were opposed, and also wanted a longer maturities. </seg>
<seg id="582"> In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="584"> But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid and Tripodi, who confirmed that the government had been pressing for a review of the lease arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="585"> One of the ICAC&apos;s telephone conversations from August and September 2007 showed the characters between Obeid and Tripodi, Steve Dunn, a senior official who was changed into the Ministry of Port, after he had worked in the fishing authority under Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="586"> &quot;Was the issue discussed in these phone calls the development of commercial Verpachtung rules?&quot; Asked the deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="587"> &quot;No,&quot; Tripodi said. </seg>
<seg id="588"> I do not remember what was discussed, but it was not. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="590"> NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance </seg>
<seg id="591"> On a balmy day at the end of August, a German police helicopters flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="592"> On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="593"> According to German media wanted the BAT Antennen prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="594"> James Clap Per, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the U.S. no possibilities of foreign espionage, &quot;in order to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could strengthen their international competitiveness or their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower&apos;s former employees, began with the publication of its topics U.S. surveillance Geheimnissen, European governments and corporate executives are more sure if they can take the director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud provider, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company&apos;s paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The last straw was the revelation that was verwanzt Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone, possibly for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="598"> If you can get the most powerful person in Europe, then certainly management potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies to be transparent. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, the president of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German companies believe that the U.S. was almost as big a risk as China when it was about industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence that the United States have passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU specific IT and Internet options, and they should reduce their dependence on the US. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The companies are sceptical. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The Bundestag has been proposed, we should build a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I can close my eyes and open them again... </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;It does not work like that,&quot; said Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP. </seg>
<seg id="609"> If you had a strong European IT industry, then they should not let die 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to automobiles to agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Everything, except for the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Nevertheless, the scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked firms that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The cloud computing is a big change, because European business leaders are aware that the data stored in the U.S. case law, and are therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="614"> According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body that did not according to the disclosures about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the US-based members plans to use an American supplier. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago, it is this: Where are saved my data and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="616"> Many German executives believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew: That powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Economic espionage is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="618"> This has always been the case. </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do that, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The management does not usually have the countermeasures taken by the attackers, which affords benefits. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In large companies, employees have long taught that the entrainment of a free USB sticks at a trade fair or unguarded behind a laptop in a hotel room, to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Ulrich hoes Berk, a board member at automaker Audi, says that it was standard practice for years to collect before a board meeting, the cell phones so that they can not be used as eavesdropping devices. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on foreign trips, because smartphones may be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Prepaid cell phones are thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="626"> There is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and supervision. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> &quot;Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the personnel and financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access,&quot; warns the BAT in a report. </seg>
<seg id="629"> The U.S. warn companies of their own economic espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="630"> According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, in second place behind China, Russia and Israel, two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data from the Hackings. </seg>
<seg id="631"> A member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it was about economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: &quot;The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> As the horses - experts met in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they knew that we were facing a tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland. </seg>
<seg id="635"> The kid, not even in kindergarten, and has made his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee came loose from the three rounds and won the first prize - the 30 adult opponents. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual contest, which is organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="637"> During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had donned his plate Muetze in a cheeky angle and led the two year old toffee through the ring. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which are far beyond his age. </seg>
<seg id="639"> And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Fenton had toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then has practiced every day with the Shetland pony. </seg>
<seg id="641"> His mother, Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and toffee are a great team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="642"> They were matched against the entire field of participants and went with Gold Cup and rosette. </seg>
<seg id="643"> It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that it wanted to be photographed with him. </seg>
<seg id="645"> The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who performed for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Howells said: &quot;The whole audience was $and all who cheered and applauded him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> He went on to sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares. </seg>
<seg id="649"> As it is launched, it will not be long until he is on the &quot;horse of the year&quot; - actor - and I am sure that he will do well. </seg>
<seg id="650"> A spokesman for the annual horse said: &quot;Fenton is only three, but he knows how to manage his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="651"> Together, they are a great team. </seg>
<seg id="652"> The jury considered Fenton and toffee according to how well they are beaten and had presented in the Vorfuehr ring. </seg>
<seg id="653"> They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders - and Fenton and toffee, the best in the ring. </seg>
<seg id="654"> I am sure that has contributed its part Fent&apos;s sweet clothes that really fit perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Day care in the small English cottage </seg>
<seg id="656"> Now for the fifth day of care in the upper succession of the Natura 2000 project Hotzenwald met a group of participants in the small English cottage in Ibach. </seg>

<seg id="885"> &quot;Even though there are fewer delivery figures for aircraft detection, but clearly we are disappointed by the margins of development in the transport sector,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note. </seg>
<seg id="886"> We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the contract, if the test program is progressing for the plane. </seg>
<seg id="887"> But if there are no new orders in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Bombardier hopes that the aircraft of the contract can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="889"> The first test aircraft was presented in March after months of delays and flew to the public for the first time in September. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But so far are binding orders for the contract with 177 moderate, because potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new Duesen transport aircraft. </seg>

<seg id="897"> This is happening throughout the flight program. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it said on the part of companies. </seg>

<seg id="900"> Bombardier said that it checked the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update this in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="901"> &quot;The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="902"> In the third quarter with the end of September 30 Bombardiers net profit to $147 million, or 8 cents per share fell by $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier. </seg>

<seg id="909"> &quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and market relations as a whole were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has risen by nearly eleven percent to $2.1 billion. </seg>

<seg id="975"> The so-called German exhibition with the original title &quot;sacred chants to commemorate the sacrifice of the Mass,&quot; d 872, is a spiritual music by the composer Franz Schubert in 1826 and was at the time of the creation almost revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="976"> The show is performed as part of the services, such as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Under the direction of the choir Hermann Schneider is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein gladness Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Scientists have been able to throw more light on what the relationship is with the capable of creatively organizing his mood. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched out to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was in nervous dogs the left side. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But now scientists say that other dogs these subtle differences can perceive and respond to it. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Giorgio Vall Orti Gara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans, is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here we have tried to look at this in other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He also pointed out that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their tail, the researchers monitored the animals, while others saw these movies. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Soon we are likely to understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vall Orti said: &quot;We have shown the Gara dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> If the animals saw how an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they are able to relax completely. </seg>
<seg id="989"> But it was left to the tail of the dog that wags perspective (again), increased their heart rate and they saw restless. </seg>
<seg id="990"> According to Professor Vall Orti Gara deliberately the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Instead, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should not be worried, and when. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: &quot;When it comes to encounters with other dogs and is the perfect place with the tail in a direction more with friendly behavior and produces the right-hand page is a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was as follows: &quot;Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog that wags his tail&quot; of left and right, rather than in the Italian study to be restless - precisely the other way around. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his testimony could stir the differences so that interpretations of the dogs in the various studies of animals in films or the robot dogs and dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still must be determined and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Because of their behavior, but simply record will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one direction, sometimes the other. </seg>

<seg id="1084"> &quot;A gross error,&quot; said Rangnick, the referee Harkam as &quot;inadequate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Harkam would also have &quot;its share&quot; contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Groedig - coach Adi Huetter after the game. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> He determinedly defended his German compatriot: &quot;I would behave in each situation the same way as Roger Schmidt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleagues after the skirmishes with Huetter. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> I do not know why. </seg>

<seg id="1093"> Above all, the way the team plays, is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> This is gone. </seg>

<seg id="1098"> A study by the British government has announced to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Transport Minister Baroness Kramer, said the project &quot;will bring Britain closer together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> After the completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail line between London and northern England by £32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS2 Ltd, asked for more routes and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> These include the possibility of an eventual travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, which brings together Britain and its cities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1108"> We are moving ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Without it, we are facing a Kapazitaets crisis in our network. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The Scottish Secretary Alistair campaign commented: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1112"> On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown campaign to make &quot;absolutely clear&quot; for the Scottish involvement into the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland at the same time provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Great Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1114"> We are therefore pleased to work as partners with the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, the benefits for all and completes the connection Glasgow - Edinburgh, the Scottish Government&apos;s plans. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> I look forward to examining the report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopt the next steps. </seg>

<seg id="1117"> In fact, Waltraud Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, an old trees, friendly neighbors and not too much traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> &quot;They have hopefully not afraid of spiders?&quot; Asks Waltraud, and shows a big spider on door frames. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> I am looking for some time now, a new apartment for my husband and me. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many stairs to the house and not being able to accomplish in the apartment, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Moreover, since a meniscus operation has experienced the Mittfuenfzigerin first-hand what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Recently, she published a book on the subject of happiness in the age - What residential form is the best for me? .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1126"> &quot;Our apartment is the best example of what is not aged at all,&quot; she starts to tell. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> More than 20 years ago, when she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Today, with Waltraud Ries in mid-fifty, thinks differently. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> They also know that it is one of the few people who, with the theme &quot;living in old age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Most of it, as long as it is. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Old buildings are always only the other, &quot;she says humorous. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Only when the suffering, do you really think. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;Then it can be a bit too late,&quot; said Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined lifestyle in old age. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> &quot;What a living form, however, is always an individual choice,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> D i e solution is not for old age. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Even those who could afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could be ill. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> And: &quot;Without good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita,&quot; warns the book Autorin Aussiedlung Willi gene. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Among their models are classic forms of childcare models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> At the age of each of his ticks and quirks </seg>
<seg id="1141"> &quot;For me it would be nothing but a residential community,&quot; she says with a wink. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> &quot;In the age simply takes its retreat,&quot; said Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> A senior residential community that can work, however, do not want to exclude the book author. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> But then it must be different from the classic students - WG. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And sometimes you just want only his rest, &quot;she believed. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> She is hardly alone, at least in the state capital. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> &quot;The majority of old people in Stuttgart will remain as long as it is in their own apartment,&quot; is also the experience of Theresa Ruetten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The department advises people about &quot;age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1150"> So often, elderly people would just take inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment buildings. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Ries recommends that all those who deal with this conversion of their house or an apartment to find out not only to hire the best craftsmen. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Today, there are specialists for this transformation. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Even in the rental apartment will be realized one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But not always, reconstruct the existing flat age and thus accessible, even if it is still as beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Waltraud Ries had to make this experience. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> While you could install a stair lift, which is also in the apartment with a cobblestone path to the door, but the far greater obstacle. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It will proceed until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Before the parade will hate it more than before the spider on their front door. </seg>

<seg id="1249"> Deutsche Bahn wants to improve next year, has brought forward the rail route. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> In particular, to increase the safety of railroad crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The rebuilding of the communities, they must participate with one third of the cost, the rest share and covenant. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schilt Achs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council on the specifics of the Bahuebergangs &quot;deer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There, the city plans to build the tunnel in Mundes west of the railway tracks a bulge. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There may be bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, are at oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the street from time to time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This was discussed in the municipal council is controversial because some councillors questioning the need for road expansion: Thomas Kipp, the mood of the critics, saying: &quot;We have to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing &quot;deer&quot; will be used regularly for long wooden Transporte. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood from the area, in part, &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will be transported via this route because they could not use the vehicles up to 20 metres the track at the Haeberle bridge, because they could not turn to the main street. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> Moreover, the line serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> It is clear that Kirch would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case, the Wolf River &quot;on&quot; deer &quot;also have an important traffic for a longer period. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The council agreed to investigate what&apos;s intended enlargement costs would cause the street. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway was agreed by a majority of transition with the proviso that the retaining wall is being built so that the city&apos;s subsequent road towards &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; for meeting traffic could eventually expand to around 5.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The renovation of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein may have a different problem, the access to the steeply rising &quot;Geroltzhaeuser path&quot; concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned end of the Geroltzhaeuser way then possible. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation concluded that it is not excluded that the tilt of the street could lead to &quot;prolonged vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for this, in turn, enter the city as a Straßenbaulasttraegerin. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The disputes could drag the liability. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Because both worked wood collection and turning in the current state of development, should they not agree to the reconstruction of the rail crossing, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> At this point is also the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle in the transition to much lower than in the other crossings, because is the next stop in the middle, which is a good view. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even the streets, even at this point would have to be slowed down as far as that of a collision. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The reconstruction of this train, because the city&apos;s consent has been denied by the majority of the problem with aufsitzenden Schiltach vehicles &quot;would have to pay,&quot; said the councils, which could withdraw the train after the construction of the responsibility. </seg>

<seg id="1294"> Over the years, innovation has been very pretty, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Founded and headed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carol Ines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and theaters. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;Most of these began with Carol&apos;s headliner, and were always successful, until it became too well known to act in a club,&quot; said Hirsch. </seg>

<seg id="1308"> &quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry&apos;s entire work,&quot; Steinberg said. </seg>

<seg id="1427"> Coulson, phone hacking tips for checking of a </seg>
<seg id="1428"> The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, supposedly &quot;phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005, heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot;special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails, and they followed, but Coulson also called and left messages, such as the court was told. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> &quot;According to the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, no one is above the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that faced with a history of people like to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> He said NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The publisher is personally involved in the third method. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously he knows from the second, the surveillance, it cannot be changed. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He knows about the phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> He continues to deny this, but we say: &quot;And if he knew about it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Clarke&apos;s rumours of an affair were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: &quot;Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A band with voice mail from their phone has been secured by at least three occasions in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, Pawlby and her sister as &quot;projects&quot; were saved. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> When the research, the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voice mail with the following content: &quot;I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, I would like to speak with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Edis said, followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett Coulsons activities in this story. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with an affair with a married woman, when he was stable even with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: Up Fast </seg>
<seg id="1449"> African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white age mates whom studies show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes do not mean immediately puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger for early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Medical Association children this week in Orlando, Florida, declared the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes among American girls are relatively normal and a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally there is no indication that now the puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achsel hair and body odor, among girls. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of first menstruation) in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to menarche,&quot; Kaplowitz said, also author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this problem often encountered.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most accurate test of how the pace of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is a controversial issue, which is indeed the beginning of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious,&quot; if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, slowing down the process or - something that can monitor a pediatrician. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For faster progress could be shown by an Endikronologen tests in order to prevent serious problems like tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bone that can ultimately lead to growth and thus Hemmung small body size in adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: &quot;The suppression of puberty can lessen behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to see her very young daughters of the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;They are worried about the Schwangerschafts risk or how they handle hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter was with her in ten days. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> She was scared and excited by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Young girls are similar to those used in puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> He supported a study of the 2001 girls aged six to nine, which establishes a connection between body fat and the transition to adolescence. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white peers. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are different explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Global seems influenced by all sorts of things to be an early adolescence, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Another conundrum: Although a growing boy&apos;s face and pubic hairs earlier, the trend is not so strong as to a full earlier puberty in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors on the Piezon ® - Conference stressed the complexity of the issue. </seg>

<seg id="1526"> It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German champions Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> The guests were predominantly to hear fans with their chants. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> By contrast, the southern gallery, where the most loyal of loyal - and loudest - BVB fans, was very quiet: No chants, no battle cries. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> The podium of the Capo, which coordinates the common spirit, remained unfilled. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> And quite lonely on the front of the grandstand blew a large flag with the inscription &quot;stadium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Only entered as a goalkeeper, as always, Feller became the first player - the court, brandete short-run jubilation. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> When his team mates, there was vociferous singing and a few hours, long scarves - but not everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South, there was nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Even the positive experiences of the last few days, that stadium spokesman Norbert II - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, extend the contract of coach Juergen Klopp - recited, not for celebration. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Only five minutes before the whistle, climbed the podium - and until then, with hands tangible tension erupted into a loud cry, a restaurant had II, as usual, the mood on the terraces at the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Finally, as always, the gallery&apos;s turn again as usual - and finally was the loudest place in the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> And when the whistle blows from the south gallery the full-throated call &quot;Derby winner is on&quot; everything came back, as always. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The silence before was probably a response to the events of recent days. </seg>

<seg id="1545"> The zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics, we can not give up. </seg>

<seg id="1547"> Otherwise, Watzke, will define the BVB a sanction by the end of next week. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> &quot;This is serious,&quot; said Watzke. </seg>

<seg id="1550"> What happens on the road with my email? </seg>
<seg id="1551"> E-mail is actually an electronic letter. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> The draft was implemented Internet e-mail service similar to conventional mail, the letter secret? </seg>
<seg id="1553"> In the design of the early Internet services, the priority has been to make communication possible. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Therefore, it has not respected the basic technical protocols to create a stable foundation for an anhoersicheren correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> It is a traditional e-mail more like an open postcard than a sealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> If user &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Benn&quot; to send a message to the computers of the two directly? </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The e-mail program or browser of Anna&apos;s first sends an e-mail to the mail server of your service provider. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> If it has, for example, a GMail account, it would be Google. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> This mail server sends the content to the Provider, uses the Benn. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> On the track, running the mail server on the Internet via a number of others. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Bennie can call the content of its providers. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> To read traditional emails on their way through the net? </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Most emails are read several times on the way of software robots. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> The provider of the sender will be reviewed as a rule, whether the e-mail is a malicious program attached. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> The receiver systems will also make a virus check. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Also check the provider, whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail, which will wegsortiert deleted immediately or at least in a spam folder. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The robots have yet another task? </seg>
<seg id="1568"> When the robot systems such as GMail determined the information needs the Google for placing context - advertising. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> When Anna and Benn communicate via GMail about their next holiday trip, Google can display links to holiday purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Also unknown people read the emails? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The likelihood of unauthorized persons a mail is extremely low. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Theoretically this is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Companies often have administrators the option of delightfully electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services have legal possibilities to intercept emails or to take note. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Then there are the illegal Ausspaeh actions. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Is it possible to protect emails against reading? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> With an encryption to the OpenPGP standard e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> With high technical complexity, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that once could not be determined immediately, who is talking to whom. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Private mailboxes are used mainly in the Yahoo and Google, according to a study by Conv Ios Consulting from August 2013, only a minor role. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> While the shares had fallen by Yahoo, most recently, &quot;GMail from Google. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Germany&apos;s biggest state church has Offensivegestartet, to promote the work of the pastor. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Background is a shortage of priests, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover, expects that it will halve the number of their roughly 1,800 Pasto and pastors to present situation until 2030. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It is attractive to be able to determine the safety and life itself. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> With Burfien instructed the State Church for the first time, a pastor at a full place to inspire young people to the program. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: &quot;God&apos;s voice is quiet, the world is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1589"> It is the work of great freedom and diversity. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> I can inform Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Although pastors may be as close to the people. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> They earned as much as teachers and could live well. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Certainly in the free economy will pay more, but it would have a secure employer theologians. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> The young people of today, not only about career, but a meaningful work. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> According to the State Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently receives annually about 60 pastors to retire. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At the same time, starting about 40 graduates of the Augustinian theology studies. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland could be struggling to fill posts in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Burfien wants, among other things, training sessions for young people and invite the celebrities who have studied theology. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> The program offers a broad education. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> You can even become Federal President. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Hearing before the Royal Commission, charged with two YMCA staff members before allegations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA staff members from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 charges have been levelled against the children, Jonathan Lord, Caring Bah, told the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> But at the opening statement before the Commission of the YMCA, said it was &quot;never in the organization had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Managing director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employees had been accused of any wrongdoing with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caring Bah Hall 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him had been condemned. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he knew from the first case, but did not know the second. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA of the Commission was also inaccurate in saying, &quot;there was external inspections of the YMCA, which was recognised by the YMCA as a frontline in the children&apos;s safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second lowest score of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) has received in August of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management of the &quot;failed&quot; by me in the recruitment of Lord and do not ensure that employees are aware of their obligations to report violations of the rules on child safety. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses involving twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was sentenced to at least six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had held a cultural problem and the employees to report violations of the Lords regarding the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that was Lord alone with children, they privately as a babysitter, she was sitting on his lap, said that he was a loving, and children playing with his cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was worried for his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was in the YMCA Caring Bah, the Lords, &quot;was very daunting and very remote to most of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The Managing Director has stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to report to their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead, he said, it has affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they have not reported. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organization from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident,&quot; said, &quot;this&quot; was not by employees, and the board voted to approve him. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the accusations, the managing director of the YMCA&apos;s children&apos;s services, Liam Whitley, had been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said that this should be avoided contamination of evidence, which has been implemented but &quot;overzealous&quot; and bad. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW is in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, there have been no safe organization for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse, the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> He explained that &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The hearing was postponed until 20 December. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Tourism: Descent to the Romans </seg>
<seg id="1623"> At around 120 metres in length is kept below a sewage channel from Cologne from the Roman era. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Visiting the cathedral of Cologne, is not over. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> About 157 meters of the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> But few visitors who visit the two slender spires, guessed that locals are under the cathedral, a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is an expert on the underworld. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Meeting place for its leaders, the service center of Cologne - tourism directly on the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour has very unspectacular beginnings: &quot;We are in the garage,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an autogerechte city, and therefore stopped by the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too big. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the Park House today therefore come to the Roman ruins and put their car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking deck, separated by metal Gitter Staebe archaeological site. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> About five meters high are unfortunately ruins of stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are remains of the Roman town wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before going back to the surface, Schulze participants on the upper level is a glimpse into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is perceived. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participant back down into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We are seeing here once the office of the most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> What does CCAA, wants to know a visitor. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;The acronym stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, &quot;which in English means&quot; city of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult &quot;means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And the Pretorian is the former governor&apos;s palace, the power center of the Roman empire at the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer channel, which is here given to around 120 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> &quot;You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like,&quot; encouraging Schulze guests. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Schulze has a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> After he took office the key, he leads the group with a 16 meters deep, walk-in shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in a mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community built its dip deep into the ground to get water, which was the reason for the ritual washing. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on Town Hall Square, for which construction is to begin shortly. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> But it will take some years to complete. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Land Rover announced Rally Series </seg>
<seg id="1652"> In the interior are racing seats and six -point belts and a hands-free. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care by Bowler Works - mechanics and logistical support to vehicle Einlagerung between events. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The Rally - customers who come to Bowler, have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1655"> They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as a possible way to world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are happy to believe this path in partnership with Land Rovers and opening of the MSA and the format that opens up new opportunities, the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, and newcomers to the hardships and the reality of Rally Raid. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> We had really fun to develop the Defender Challenge - car - which is an entertaining championship. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Moreover, there is the Defender Challenge, training and test day in February, as well as the option of desert race in North Africa and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> George Kere Van: European unbundling gives the Scots the election </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new Schreckens history of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This is the key word for stories of passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrian&apos;s Walls. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Indeed, it was pointed out in the template forming on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> No one even mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is more advantageous to them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> That is not really a story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one that has occurred in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The first time I used the &quot;independence means passport controls at least 40 years ago,&quot; duck heard. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> This is an interesting point in the continuous replay of this ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should you expect from an independent Scotland that it is at the European pipe? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why the London exchange against the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> These are the real European news: The large, adopted after the war plan for the unification of Europe is stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis the European project is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU, are hostile to the EU - or want to have the euro as their common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - until this year - almost five million votes in the federal election in September, and thus effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current economic crisis, as a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which is forced the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments will cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters and the German politicians would want to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only way is to cut public spending and wages - spurred by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget and monetary problems, a deeper European productivity problem. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and gas fourfold. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All the world does not reward hard Schreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war, the EU saw France&apos;s political elite as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and could keep Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But Paris and Berlin does not need more than gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has put its own economic policy, which the struggling French economy. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing National Front, hostile to the EU has just won a crucial by-election and the ruling Socialists in three. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can expect a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> They want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti- common currency bloc in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point I want to: In the not-so-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency, to the abolition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but it is more like the &quot;Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle preferred. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope of cosying up to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Nevertheless, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where does Scotland in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can determine a region by (ultimately) to be small - England. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Brussels, Berlin and say what they want to hinstecken. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I suspect that Scotland could run a looser European union quite well, as long as we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise, we should consider that Norway do well and maintain our economic independence. </seg>

<seg id="1707"> FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no cell phone conversations) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Passengers can now from departure to landing their electronic devices to read, listen to music, games, activities and use the prestige of films, but not with your mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published in the US. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> But passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How fast they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, Michael Huerta, FAA employees at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The FAA, the airlines must demonstrate that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices under the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA said that she had already received plans by some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the plane doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> You can start only once the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the go-ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> At the entrance to the runway, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again until the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Under the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference, the devices also allow its passengers to start, landing and use on the tarmac, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most new airliners and other planes that were adapted for the use of Wi-Fi in larger amounts, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline about this together - will benefit both sides,&quot; commented Glading. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Frankly, we are sorry to have to feel on this subject as watchdogs. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers will be asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> &quot;Words With Friends,&quot; is still not online, the Scrabble game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he is an American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to switch the device, while the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> And heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> In-flight cell phone conversations are also banned. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulatory authority for phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA lifts ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month, said Mark Rosen of the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national transportation issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered as a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer stations,&quot; said Rosen, also from the air. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, suggested last month that the government will permit a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, as critics represented the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are more difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies say that up to a third of the passengers are missing or ignored the closure of the unit. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers had become, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment brought in by passengers VHF radios that were then the latest technology trend. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that comprise them electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the flight is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The Wi-Fi systems, pilots are also less susceptible to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Today&apos;s electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if umblaettert. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> But when it comes to downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices used by passengers is Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> 2011 firm employees invited an airliner full of Kindle e-book reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could find none. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd said the passenger association, National Association of Airline Passengers that he believes that the distraction of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who did speak for a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to land in poor visibility conditions instruments in the closure of the devices by the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a proper adjustment for travelers who extensively today would be equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that there is not a pleasant experience at odds with the safety of passengers,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to involve the people early on in the planning,&quot; Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the Hochwasser protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Around 80 participants had arrived in the town hall in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions, raise concerns and ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Häußler made it clear: &quot;The ultimate decisions make the members of the parish council.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The flooding, which Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was unprepared, was a crucial event, which raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river area investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the Hochwasser protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection of cultivated land is the goal,&quot; says Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> It is actually planning the protection of a statistically every 100 years, according to the German weather service expected floods. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Climate change is driven by a 15% surcharge. </seg>

<seg id="1807"> In order to achieve the protection HQ 100 aKlima, must be invested in Gechingen around EUR four million, and the community can expect with country subsidies amounting to around 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> But Häußler pointed out that there is promoting only if an overall concept will be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> In the best case, could be started in 2016 with the implementation. </seg>

<seg id="1814"> Among other things, questioned why are no longer planned dams and reservoirs to protect the village. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms and Corbe from Huegels home, who presented the concept, stressed that the interplay of all these measures needed to achieve the desired goal. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large orders on seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading aircraft manufacturers has given rise to an argument about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to make airlines, but most of these designated areas is the key to efficiency claims with the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus this week called for an industry standard that a seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, says the American rivalry between Boeing, the airlines should decide. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17th to 21th November expect record orders. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> What is the structure of the rear of the aircraft - especially if there are nine or ten rows of seats - is crucial to the economic results that the new &quot;mini Jumbo&quot; is supposed to provide. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing claims its new &quot;777 X&quot; will be 406 people in seats in economy class, about 17 inches wide, and ten per series. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 astutely 350 persons in 18 -inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per series. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertising in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, which will make the 777 X with more than 100 orders for the race, directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The company recently unveiled an ad that the beginning of a new ad war, donors could and showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;Would you accept that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo props,&quot; says Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> People with different dietary habits are thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, and the end of the century defined the modern long-haul travel has increased the weight of the average American males between 40 and 49 years by ten percent, according to the data of the U.S. health ministry. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21th century, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept in the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized &quot;jet set&quot; was narrow. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> We have, Airbus, investigations that documented that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat will sleep quality by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing disputed Airbus says the numbers on the seat Maßen and that it is not up to the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The company also stated that the experience in the aircraft, according to research by more than the seat width. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It is really intended to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful,&quot; says the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> They do not want to dictate to them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> You know your business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the Sitzlayout the driving force behind the battle for new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing are 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 -seater Boeing 77 - 300 ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Boeing&apos;s statements on the results depend in part on the 777 X is compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently with ten seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in the 777s indicated that many passengers have opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airline fares. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which to select the airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The world-travelling jet salesman with a tape measure even contribute to the establishment of the competition and gherkins. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but sold by his own account, not yet. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for greater adaptability of the cabin and offered some jets wide seats on the corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets that experts say will evaporate the call for a new industry standard, but probably could distract from the wave of 777 X - sales. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> According to the lexicons of veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, but this is different in a significant way. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> While vegetarians, eating ice cream cake, or a powerful Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Vega&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the waiver of meat and fish, the vegans from all consumption of animal products - including honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> What, one might wonder, but a closer look at the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable resourcefulness. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Sandwich spreads are very popular,&quot; says Ute Henkel, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> He eventually won a vegan for 13 years, he finds M100 (almost) everything that he needs to live. &quot;1997 I asked my diet, and was a vegetarian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Around the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers leather and artificial leather. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He recognized that it is also in other everyday matters without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> It is primarily a vegan ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I do not want that animals have to die for me,&quot; says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm went up. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It is a double bonus today,&quot; says Proctor, &quot;indeed, his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the one with the diet, the selection of dining options, Proctor more on the power of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> These conditions would also fail, and some even well-intentioned attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction is a crucial factor that many can be quickly abandoned, like smoking,&quot; Proctor, a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> A: &quot;Certain tastes and are not in the animal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;You can also produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; explains the vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Proctor brings to a barbecue, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan Wuerste. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> It is a balanced, varied diet, it should also taste to eat again. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course, if you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It is supposed to taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Health to eating disorders, a more widespread adoption, he does not have suffered. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> The change was a positive aspect for me. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I take no foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I am checking myself, my blood values are often,&quot; Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus, critics warn. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;When animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat that you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 - share high,&quot; Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12 - values are in order,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Proctor must not go long distances for food procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and now every supermarket has soy milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Everything I need, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only once in a while I buy something special. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlooked that only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known as&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1933"> It is much cheaper and less time-consuming to prepare vegan meals than is commonly believed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;There is a lot to explore in the home kitchen, with a few little tips can be good, if not achieve better results,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor was able to bring his in-laws. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Family celebrations gives the vegans a new seasoning. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is dynamic, if combined, has a new role. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations that can arise in the process are as different as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> But, of course, he was shown skepticism. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> You do not taste my food? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;I feel bad because I drank milk?&quot; - On such issues as vegans must act with sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would live no Enklaven existence. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And, more specifically, the everyday world seems so veganfremd as limited and not sufficient vigour of vegans are all in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> The fast food is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Chips are everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Döner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or simply ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants are so slow. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;When I started 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult for me to eat vegan,&quot; the New Zealanders, a development that: &quot;You must talk to the people who make it to their attention.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;If enough demand, they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu,&quot; he hopes. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Proctor is the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Essentially, vegan dishes for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat them, they are exactly the opposite of that. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> &quot;Meat dishes are exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they preclude others from,&quot; Proctor said. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> &quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safer way to make it impossible for the most part in the first place,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Purchasing our products can be a little difficult but at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Especially when one learns to understand that in peanuts may contain a donor animal additives as a color, it seems to comply with the ethics of so many hurdles and traps to leave quickly for courage. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen not only wrote a book, &quot;Vegan Issimo - animal substances and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many ingredients, but the food and detergents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> &quot;We know a scanner gradually developed views and the signs and logos,&quot; it is sometimes better to do than to stay small steps or to stumble, &quot;Proctor knows. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Of veganism, he is an important moral signal, which is proposing to raise awareness. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Perhaps he can&apos;t quite call it his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question its habits. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Bavaria Basketballer despite optimistic first defeat </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Even the first defeat in the Euro League could not diminish the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich, the huge optimism. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> &quot;No one can forbid us to believe to win against the best team in Europe over the past two years,&quot; said Bayern coach Sveti Lav Pesic of the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the Olympic title in Piraeus. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> We have sent the message: Even in Munich is basketball. </seg>

<seg id="1972"> New nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which can take some years, said Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the first results are good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful that we can help this kind of vaccination strategy once millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all methods available on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus, the liver cells that produce a constant stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibodies in the blood Molekuele hunt the nicotine and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine, their normal level of activity. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without vaccination would have a &quot;time out&quot; on the other hand, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Former tobacco Impfstoffe failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The vaccinations had to be ordered to maintain the antibodies Pegels so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> As Professor Crystal, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> But it is more likely that smokers would use to stop him. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;You know: If they are beginning to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no longer enough, and that helps them to overcome the habit,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> British scientists said, the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is necessary. </seg>

<seg id="1992"> When she refuses, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic Superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> The film never glides into sensationalism or prurience - and that is his problem. </seg>

<seg id="1995"> Egypt&apos;s first freely elected president sworn in </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Mohamed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph may not be the end of the political disputes in Egypt. </seg>

<seg id="1998"> With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt&apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago. </seg>

<seg id="2000"> &quot;We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> &quot;Today the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Morsi, an U.S. educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been taken since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization targeted by the respective government. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven pm local time in a small car Konvoi. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court, shouting for joy about the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was halted only temporarily, so that the Konvoi could cross the busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> The Brotherhood has derided as an uncharismatisches &quot;spare tire&quot; increased his personal prestige in his victory speech and a free day, not only for himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the autocratic Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> &quot;Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; declared in a blue suit with red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he gave the oath of office. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech. </seg>

<seg id="2010"> Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo in the 1970s has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> On Friday, Morsi presented a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that had been accepted by the Military Council hunted out of office by the head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> But with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament he prevents the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Morsi&apos;s speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures. </seg>

<seg id="2037"> Passengers who tried to get around this, therefore, as much as possible in your hand luggage, with the result that the baggage compartments above the seats are crowded. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O &quot;Malley said, the new fee is not really a question of earning money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> It was the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box on the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> This means that a passenger must check in at the gate of Frontier, a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O &quot;Malley said, the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The Frontier&apos;s new carry-on fee will only come into force in the summer, there is not yet a specific date. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers often grumbled about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines are happy to back. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the transport of luggage cost money, and passengers should pay for this service if they wished. </seg>

<seg id="2126"> John Kerry, with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the U.S. in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that espionage is inappropriate in certain cases, &quot;gone too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2127"> The foreign minister also announced that he would bear the responsibility together with Barack Obama that on &quot;autopilot&quot; have switched, when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA&apos;s spying activities. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The leaked information is the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In a speech transmitted via video link on the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in the government of some things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to the 11th of September.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Then, he became the first senior member of the U.S. government that have exceeded the U.S. spying a border, but stressed that no rights had been abused. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> He said: &quot;In some cases, the proportion has gone too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The president is determined to create clarity, and that is why a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that there is abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> I can assure you that will not affect the rights of innocent people in this process. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Kerry, however, that the NSA was a force for good, and many lives have been saved by its monitoring operations. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> He added: &quot;We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2136"> There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attack governments. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> What would happen if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens? </seg>
<seg id="2138"> We have indeed, plane crashes, prevent attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe to allay the concerns about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the anti-terror efforts with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency more anti-terror organizations. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism on board,&quot; said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs and Foreign Relations, in an interview in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in combating terror, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service declared this week that the reports are unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and have been replaced with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Other disclosures cited documents passed from Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> The director of national intelligence, James Clap, who defended the spying on allies is necessary and that this is common on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> In all the uproar, Murphy said his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, which is to take place this year, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> The names of the other MPs to be published in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip is to improve the relations, he said that it would give some &quot;serious&quot; words. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> He said that European governments would have to be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs, which they had devoted themselves for years. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> &quot;Although we can change our surveillance programs and protect the rights of Europeans, but they must come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,&quot; said Murphy. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billions </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, black holes, gravitational waves or experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were available, five are still in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> If there is at least some of them, no one knows. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or discover earth-like planets and to search for alien life, perhaps? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions confront the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For their program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such missions, &quot;l&quot; is about one billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The elite met in Paris in early September, the European space research to discuss proposals for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were discussed, five of them are now in the final round. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Many bodies on the proposals, tick with the researchers. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> A final decision is expected to fall in the next few days by the scientific program committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> A total of four big questions that Esa has selected the missions of the 2007 &quot;program&quot; cosmic vision &quot;to find answers. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes for the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets that orbit these stars still lie in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in space could pierce the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise there? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> To investigate this matter, &quot;dynasty,&quot; launching the space telescope in 2017, will be investigated with the 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But the possibilities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments, the astronomers and even the composition of their atmospheres analysed organic-rich fine fraction of planets and to search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: Gases, which are seen as sign of biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Ultimately, this question is to give information about the conditions for the emergence of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The magnetic activity plays an important role of a star and the interaction of their magnetic Felds, as well as its continued particle radiation with the planetary system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system to study these processes. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the series (the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and its moons. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> You want to find out what role played in the development of the giant planet of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> This is the kind of the first of the three L - the &quot;cosmic vision&quot; missions - programme. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey in 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> ACHT years later they reached Jupiter and the planet&apos;s atmosphere and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, Kalli Sto. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the basic physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus whether the known laws of nature are still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Maybe there are also variations that could point the way to a new theory, the physicists can come together under the umbrella of all known laws of nature. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> As the universe was born, and what is it? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> The Big Bang created our universe 13.7 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Besides the material from which stars, planets and creatures bombarded as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, accelerated by the actions of the Universe. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The researchers do not yet know what physical laws were in the first seconds of the CMB, which are still dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> With &quot;Euclid&quot; already approved by the Esa here a M- 2020 mission, scheduled to be launched. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection procedure will remain only two. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts, &quot;Lisa,&quot; a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> They have been proven to date. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could succeed, the scientists behind the project hope. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector that will be deployed in space. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> He could prove that unlike plants on Earth and gravitational waves that have emerged during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> FOUR more proposals to compete for the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena,&quot; is to explore the black holes, among other things, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder,&quot; is to identify and investigate the organic-rich planets. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Among other proposals are already resigned to the samples - returning from Mars, Venus and the exploration of the moon, asteroids and solar physics. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> CDC publicize allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="2243"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a series of guidelines for the treatment of children with food allergies in schools. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, because the number of school-age children with food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The prevalence of food allergies among children, according to the CDC between 1997 and 2007 has increased by 18 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The guidelines include information for faculty and staff at the schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools Epinephrin stock - the injection of the EpiPen brand is used most often - in order to face a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The report also contains a list of typical symptoms, which are called by children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Children may say: &quot;It feels as if something is on my tongue,&quot; &quot;my mouth feels as if there is a hair,&quot; or &quot;tickles my tongue.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2256"> Firefighters managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stranded on a 15 metre high ledge in a rock wall. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The nine-month old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was runaway after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone, before it was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, including the dog, came to the quarry Flap Pit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby to welcome and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> They had been searching desperately for their missing dog and published calls in social networks when it was bolted to the traffic accident in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> At approximately 14:15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a walkers who executed his dog, Ruby&apos;s stranded on a 15 -metre-high (in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The technical rescue team rushed to the site of the Cleckheaton Fire Station and seilte themselves to save Ruby&apos;s, which was then transported in a dog crate. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: &quot;She was in a dangerous situation. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> It was in the middle of the cliff - only 15 meters from the top and the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> They did not muscle during their rescue - she was steifgefroren. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> But now it is a good thing. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Then she has eaten a few dogs. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> That was a pretty unusual. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The fact that the dog was found, is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: &quot;Ruby had a giant luck.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Ruby was taken to the vet to investigate, but said nothing except fatigue and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;Watching the rescue was scary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2273"> I could not believe that it was really up there. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The veterinarian if they become too large and the exhaustion would have collapsed, they probably would have sunk. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The firemen have done a splendid job. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It was really brave what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> We are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Scott Alderson added: &quot;Most Influential People, we were afraid that she would fall, but they remained at the top.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2280"> The firemen were great. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> I can hardly believe, where she was. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> U.S. border: &quot;Discovered&quot; super tunnel for drug smuggling </seg>
<seg id="2283"> On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered a &quot;super tunnel&quot; and shut down illicit drug smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As reported by U.S. customs authorities, was more than 500 meters long tunnel between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> THREE suspects were arrested, eight tons of confiscated marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel was not yet in use, according to the data. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they can appears under the radar,&quot; said the general prosecutor of the U.S. Southern California district, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered that one end of the tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy: &quot;If you continue such a tunnel and tried to use them, we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> More than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006 have been associated with drug crime. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> From the experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Because of the elaborate tunnel, the investigators assumed that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that construction took about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Construction was so that could be used electrically powered cars. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> On the Mexican side, the access in a building that is 80 meters away from the border. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities, a head 20 metres in depth to the tunnel entrance. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> He also would have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the US. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> All of them, as a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it said at the press conference in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> But it is the first time that has been found in such a tunnel construction cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Cocaine is typically smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This showed the &quot;desperation&quot; of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off, said Bill Sherman of drug searches DEA in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> They would do everything to get into the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> No details were given to the detainees, at least one is Mexicans, it said. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> To add to prison terms of up to ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Obama&apos;s climb-down in health policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his often repeated, clear promise: &quot;If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After receiving hundreds of thousands of their insurers a letter of resignation, the president threw the Republicans in recent days that he had deceived the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> &quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who receive such communications, to look for a new insurance on the open market. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens might be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;You get a better offer,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed their own insurance, would have to look around for another collective contract, because it does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I want to tell the Americans very directly: They deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform since October &quot;abysmal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2319"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am determined to regain your confidence. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This is a disgruntled Sebelius to sit behind her advisers during yesterday&apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long from Missouri. The concern was whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> After more than three hours of hearing, Sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act have not renounced voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance to complete itself a tariff to HealthCare.gov, she now wants to sell millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Parents can choose from intersexuellen children &quot;indeterminate gender.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation where a third sex is recognised for children who were not born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> No longer will newborns be rigidly male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Under the new law, parents have to explain a sex can be more for these children, but &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on the birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a sex allocation for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexuellen people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> A year later, according to the BBC, said: &quot;I am neither man nor woman intersexuelle person.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I maintain the patchwork, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> An estimated one in 2,000 children every year, either as a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They are among the Inter Sexu Ellen, a group that, among the diagnosis &quot;sexual Differenzierungs disorder&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was probably intersexuell. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts recommend in the US, we should use the best available information on sex, if a provision is not possible to wait and not on the psychological and physical development of the child, before we go - if any - for an operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;blade for a good cause.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Intersexuelle children pose an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical procedure, but for most children are not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait, like developing the identity. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity, are not at all. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It is like the mystery of why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states intersexuelle people were indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not geschlechtsbezogen, but by their biological condition, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically not both at the same time, or when one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These properties were in second-tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in Chromosom structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and Vorurteils crime. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> No boys have been consistent with the picture of a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> Meanwhile, it is in Australia and Nepal for adults, male, female, or &quot;third sex&quot; on official documents. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June, Australians (52) and Norrie May Welby - the world&apos;s first &quot;recognized&quot; largely unknown person after a court had granted lifelong retention of a &quot;unspecified&quot; sexual status. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> Besides the German cards have in the future, and a third, to intersexuell, the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news story on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In 2011, dozens of French parliamentarians have signed a petition to the strict Catholic country that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The U.S.-based site Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, saying: &quot;If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn baby, they told of Maryland would be better if babies will be assigned a sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The parents&quot; existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don&apos;t know the sex of your child, &quot;she said of the parents. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, were seen as Hermaphroditen, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Ten years ago, the medicine the sex as something that you could build and destroy. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> But meanwhile, questioned the ethical bases of operation, as is now known, the complexity of gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child&apos;s upbringing with the sex assigned to them. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> &quot;In the mid-20th century called it&quot; a psychiatric emergency, &quot;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals, Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives - educate the parents as a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and consider whether such a person as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But in one under the title &quot;John / Joan&quot; case in 1966, his controversial theories. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to neuter the child to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;This case is presented as a successful example of a conversion, but not what it was,&quot; says Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38 but he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher, there are still physicians who would have encouraged this approach. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public, &quot;not happy with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Such as Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> So his external body and the testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> At the age of 12 he was awarded female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he demanded his medical files. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD that his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After he learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and remove his breasts. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> The operation is becoming barren. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersexuelle people are perceived as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> But Anne Tamar - Mattis, managing director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;could&quot; encourage places like Catalonia and stamped. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not&quot; assign, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear that favours interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> But we do not know yet how it will impact the law, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar, Mattis said that her organization would support the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adult recognition as a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> The German law relates to the allocation at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> This is not a fight to the little children should be forced to produce at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual Differenzierungs disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;and&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Baratz&apos;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Andro resistance gene. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the Rezeptor Defektes of target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> In 29 and today is married Katie; she works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> While it is barren, but hopes that adoption or a surrogate mother to get a child. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents, and they must not make hasty decisions,&quot; Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> They will be given the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they are &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; letter. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way, everything is fine - it attracts the child size and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> It was a wonderful baby and the parents. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And we must not rush to make an operation, which is not irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;This includes the children in the decision and the fear is that parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> The child ultimately decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and that is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> This will allow children to make the decision themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent mastered the fight </seg>

<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The consumption of ice cream responds with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and the lights. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Chris explained that ice lights respond to the heat in the mouth and so the more you lick, the brighter it is. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Charlie, founder of Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious ice cream company, &quot;says:&quot; The product is incredible, but still at a very early phase of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> In the ice cream protein reacted with the tongue with a neutral pH value. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> If the mouth warmed up the protein, the pH and the ice. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful luminous. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made, because of the jellyfish light fabric is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Each bullet costs about 140 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> But it tastes delicious. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> But his latest creation is to be more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> He says: &quot;I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> This is not, in itself, impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are made by Chinese scientists. </seg>

<seg id="2519"> It is not only that the paper Zeugs disfigured the landscape. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Bags also have been triggered by accidents and traffic facilities, including barriers hidden. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> So what does the &quot;throwaway society&quot; but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If you are travelling more often at night, particularly with several people in the car, you know, a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are piling up. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> That would represent a few bags but also nothing more or less - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to rumtrampeln on swill. </seg>

<seg id="2532"> -SPECIAL plants replace conventional whipped cream. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also, there are herbal alternatives to eggs. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a pie. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> 50 ounces applesauce or one tablespoon ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> It will, for example, instead of egg with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of vegetable starch and three Essloeffeln mineral water. </seg>

<seg id="2539"> A black box in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box, which will take place in the dashboard of each car. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices, which record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are central to a controversial trial of Washington and the state was planning to revise the outdated system of financing American roads. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The normally rather dull road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and called for the government of the small boxes to record mileage charges - and possibly, where they were taken and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax, oaths. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But while no agreement can be reached on a course of action in Congress, several states do not wait any longer. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> They are looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile travelled. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of motorists have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance, already tested. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> This really is a must for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;It is not something that we will only use may be,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, director of the Southern California Assn. Of Governmental Movements, which has a record of a milestone for all California motorists in the state since 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The way we pay these taxes, will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, Americans pay at the pump is broke. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> But in America is no longer as much petrol as before. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars use less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians do not dare to high gasoline prices, raise the tax by a penny. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on commercial law at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> The federal government has recently provided 500 cars with black boxes, which are designed to test a meilenbasiertes payment system. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;This is the best option in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats call it meilenbasierte user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Not surprisingly, the idea of urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence the behaviour to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> California&apos;s planners are counting on the system in the elaboration of strategies that are to be achieved, ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal government on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> The free marketers are taken with the idea of the Reason Foundation, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> People pay directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers, who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move toward meilenbasierter reckoning. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> But the majority in the House of Representatives, the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on the way to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> However, several states and cities move on their own in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> The most active is Oregon, which enlists 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City also is considering. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois is testing it in a limited way with lorries. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how to introduce the change. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The concept is not an universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where 50 volunteers have been recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> When the test started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown surveillance devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for more affordable technology that can capture the state mileage, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Thus, Khan, the public would be unlawful. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of motorists. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather, it was their goal to be in an emerging market for car insurance, which involves paying drivers based on miles driven. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> But the devices tested on the road planners are also interesting, because they do not use GPS and provide only limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;The people are more willing to participate, if not record their speed and locations,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these public pilot programs were made big mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There is much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with it to give drivers a number of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You can opt for a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or they do not choose equipment and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a skeptical public by providing the devices with more functions than smaller. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York City transit officials want to develop a device on taxation, will also pay the parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> &quot;Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate,&quot; it said in a planning document. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> But some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund through tax on fuel. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, are imposed, so that they pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> &quot;There is no reason for an operation if there is an aspirin,&quot; said Randy aero-engine, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things. </seg>

<seg id="2617"> Both were rejected. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Six years ago, thoughts about the creation of an artificial turf sports pitch on what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution. </seg>

<seg id="2637"> The German deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday they were unlucky with the media in Berlin, writes this: &quot;Even if it was the result of my efforts, my government is trying to be positive, treated dissent as loyalty and to criminalize political speech with criminal threat, which is not a defense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Telling the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Snowden writes in the letter that he was convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> The U.S. Department of Justice&apos;s indictment includes espionage and theft of state property. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is willing to talk with German representatives, then we will find ways to make it.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2644"> Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if it were possible, &quot;without endangering him and ruining relations with the United States.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2653"> Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential personalities </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Thousands of people gathered in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president, Samora Machel of Mozambique to sing in a rare public demonstration calls for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the words &quot;we demand security&quot; traded in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> RENAMO was formerly a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later of the Apartheit government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could invest in the next few years to more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> RENAMO claimed that the government was provoked by the recent clashes on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Rena Mos, would have attacked. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The escalated attacks on the former rebels, as government troops tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo - bases attacked, leader of the group, said Rena, spokesman for the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The government has accused Renamo of blame for the clashes and the organization that attacked soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as &quot;losers&quot; who &quot;wants to use all of its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2668"> FRELIMO and Renamo both stress that they want to avoid a war. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> But the concerns have increased since Maza Nga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> To the FT he declared that he meant that FRELIMO does not respect the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> &quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Maza Nga. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial concessions from the government. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Rena&apos;s electoral success since 1992, while a newer party shrink from a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Maza Nga said that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; said Maza Nga. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It is unclear what Renamo capacities, but she has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South ties. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but finds itself in the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> In June, a month after the use of the railway after Renamo announced an attack on the track. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Maza Nga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> RENAMO wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique,&quot; said Maza Nga. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> The instability has increased frustration with the government, said Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent Entfuehrungs wave. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Omar sultans, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> FRELIMO and Renamo &quot;no interest, they simply want to regain peace and usable roads,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2873"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest advisers have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The revelation is the number to check out surprise of the long-awaited book by Mark Stan and John competition beyond the campaign double Down: Game Change 2012, &quot;2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president&apos;s top aide, &quot;major groups&quot; meetings and surveys have been carried out at the end of 2011 to find out whether the appearance of Obama&apos;s dwindling hope of re-election, if he shall fall Biden. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> According to Jonathan Martin, nationalpolitischer correspondent for the Times, the book of the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, notably by former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice-president. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential exchange was a closely guarded secret within the Kampagneninfrastruktur in Chicago and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only half a dozen of the president&apos;s closest advisers, including Daley, Obama&apos;s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned changes. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> In &quot;double Down&quot; is that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; before eventually decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton&apos;s candidacy would &quot;significantly&quot; improve Obama&apos;s chances. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> In an interview with Martin Daley, confirmed that the government was considering to replace Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I made a number of things that can be purchased, and that was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> One must remember that the President then had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: &quot;For God&apos;s sake, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley the investigations as &quot;due diligence,&quot; said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been used during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move auszahle, on the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> &quot;In campaigns is not spent so much money on polling and focus groups, if you are not thinking seriously about something,&quot; Martin said on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley, whether his former boss had known about the potential change. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley has said he does not believe that the President was aware of the possible change ,&quot;&quot; the former chief of staff, it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added that &quot;double Down&quot; deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether we will have achieved the political soundings Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>

<seg id="2893"> The Gemeindesaeckl in Wangen - Schoenberg&apos;s stove is well stocked and debt does not know the administration since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> For the financial year 2012 can be made in this sense as an unqualified success. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This was at the launch of the annual accounts for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> As Andrea Roth, the administrative budget is planned with about 7.6 million more than a million higher than that. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The Ueberschuss of the administrative budget of around EUR 1.8 million is about one million euros over the approach. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> It was the Ueberschuss especially higher business tax revenues and the county&apos;s share of the income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The capital budget was again well above the planned values. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the EUR 1.5 million last year, it was EUR 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This is essentially due to the increase in supply from the administrative budget,&quot; says Roth. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> As planned, made in 2012, has been less investment than the backward areas and higher. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> Overall, the general reserve fund could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked the mouth and her team for their good work. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> &quot;This work cannot simply shaking out of the sleeve,&quot; Gerster praised overlooking the annual financial statements. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> He and the local councils were visibly over the good figures. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could come at the public soon. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Through the good financial situation could forgo the community in the past to high rates. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> But this, in turn, have been reduced several times, according to Gerster, grants from the country. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> For these grants from various compensatory sticks, there are conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Among other things, the cities and communities who apply for grants, with some rates. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> &quot;We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investment in the coming years, for which we would like to support,&quot; announced Gerster, in this context. </seg>

<seg id="2923"> Obama&apos;s memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Nathaniel P. Morris is the second year student at the Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> I read a terribly sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year of medical studies to liven up and give me hope. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> It is called &quot;the Audacity to Win&quot; (gaining courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama to the presidential election in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> When I&apos;m finished with my patients, &quot;and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics could rob millions and inspired speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> The election was a landslide victory and kept the news to guide the historic importance of this hour. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> My classmates and my parents wept with joy, all the newspapers that they could find. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> As Obama moved to office back in 2008, he had approval rates of 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if taken from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But there is simply nothing that I could imagine. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for medical insurance until military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> But after countless times I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, brings me to my point to the end. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I have reached a point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The Republican blockade policy does not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It does not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers will be punished, the government misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why it bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House&apos;s efforts to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And, most recently, it could not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act a simple website. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know if this is what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> If I should have understood in 18 that could contradict the government&apos;s work to their previous political campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Obviously, the parliamentarians, not a predictable rate, because of an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre public discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> But when I look at the above examples, then they seem to be largely elected by the government itself. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And that bothers me most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I have 2012 elected Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to be able to determine its direction and positions. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book all the harder. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania. </seg>
