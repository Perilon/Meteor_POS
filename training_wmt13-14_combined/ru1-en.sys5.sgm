<seg id="166"> Manufacturers jets feuding over the width of the seat at stake in big orders </seg>
<seg id="167"> Between the leading aircraft manufacturers bitter dispute broke out over the width of the tourist class seats on long haul flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute revolves around the width of the seat provided on long-haul economy class passengers, whose interests are not always in the spotlight of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in establishing the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, the proposed Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economy class, but its main U.S. rival Boeing says it should solve the airline. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The debate is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of larger and larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and on November 17-21 event expected to potentially record orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The layout of the rear of the plane - especially the sitting down 9 or 10 people in a row - is central to the statements about the cost-effectiveness of new projects &quot;mini-jumbo jet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing says its new 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed at 10 in a row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says that competing version of its A350 will carry in economy class seats on the 350 width of 18 inches, located at 9 in a row. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Giants aircraft often trade blows on technical issues through advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Now Airbus is drawn directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide showing three people in the restaurant, pressed against each other, titled &quot;Would you agree to that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> «Boeing offers long-haul flights on the seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; - said the head of John Leahy, Airbus sales. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With the change of diet people gain weight, but the airplane seat is not fundamentally changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the beginning of 1970, when the widebody Boeing 747 sets the standard for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Waistline of the average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics the U.S. Health Service. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept seats 1950s, when the average waistline of those who recently called &quot;reactive public&quot; was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus says it has ordered a study showing that the extra inch in width seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputes the figures Airbus size seat and says that producers should not interfere in the decisions about how to find a balance between the airlines fares and amenities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> According to her, studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;All it really boils down to giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed,&quot; - said the expert Boeing&apos;s Kent Craver salons. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They do not want us to decide for them that will bring them profits. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For passengers question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits. </seg>
<seg id="189"> During the dispute is worth the race for orders for the aircraft, valued at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the U.S. and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As first reported in July, Reuters, seating arrangement - this is what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets. </seg>
<seg id="191"> As Airbus, Boeing and claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engined models in comparison with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Boeing claimed characteristics are based in part on a comparison of 10-777X series include the original 9-seater layout series of constructive solutions 777. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Profit in the unit cost decreases as compared to 10-seater layout, currently in use. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason that Boeing does this is to cram more seats and make your aircraft more competitive with our development,&quot; - said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say lounges with full 10-seater series for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangement, which can go hand in hand with lower rates. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for commuters, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the proposal Airbus due to the threat from the 777-th model,&quot; - said the salon stylist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not supply the chair, but offer supplier directory from which airlines can select. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Traveling the world sellers jets even carry with them a tape measure to check the competing plan. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very compact layout salon for low cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus A350 offers a 10-seat rows, but says she still has not sold it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons offering wider of the aisle on some of its aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to &quot;take off&quot;, but may divert attention from the wave of selling model 777X. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Oleinik third of rural settlements near Moscow fully subsidized </seg>

<seg id="211"> Expenditure on the local administrative unit in 88 settlements near Moscow is over 70%, &quot;while there is a decrease of quality of services,&quot; said Olejnikov. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Previously, he instructed the heads of municipalities near Moscow before the end of November to consider which settlements require consolidation, merger in urban districts or changing the system of administration. </seg>
<seg id="213"> These proposals will be worked out by the end of January. </seg>

<seg id="223"> Within two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo - it&apos;s one of the most violent clashes since the truce for more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was supported by the white government of Rhodesia first, and then the South African government of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country. </seg>
<seg id="225"> After the Armistice in 1992 it became the opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again slide into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made the crowd of foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of vast offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could bring more than $ 50 billion in investment over the next few years by companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the U.S. . </seg>
<seg id="228"> The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force in 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other creates tension. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Renamo party argues that the government has become the instigator of recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Attacks on former rebels then exacerbated when government troops attacked the base and tried to kill Renamo Afonso Dhlakamu - leader of the group, told the Financial Times Fernando Mazang representative Renamo. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing the party in the attack on the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="232"> President Armando Guebuza tried to allay fears of instability. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Guebuza said the AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt a &quot;loser&quot;, who wanted to use &quot;all that was left of his forces to try to prove that it can impose its own solutions to the Government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="234"> How Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="235"> However, concerns rose after reports that Mazang said the refusal of Renamo peace agreement in 1992. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He told Financial Times, that meant non-compliance with the agreement Frelimo party. </seg>
<seg id="237"> &quot;Our goal - to return to negotiations, but in all seriousness,&quot; - said Mazang. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions that intensified clashes series this year. </seg>
<seg id="239"> &quot;These are two powerful men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), faced foreheads&quot; - said Joseph Hanlon, Open University lecturer and expert on Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="240"> None of them is not a good negotiator, and none of them are not ready to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Renamo party that tries to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure weakened the movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government. </seg>
<seg id="244"> The proportion of votes for Renamo reduced since 1992, while the new party - the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve their performance in these elections. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Mr. Mazang said that Mr. Guebuza, who must resign next year, when his second term, wants to destroy the country&apos;s democracy. </seg>
<seg id="246"> &quot;He does not want to multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he did not want to leave the presidency,&quot; - said Mazang. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It is unclear to the possibilities that Renamo, but she has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and vehicles to the key motorway leading from north to south. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira but includes - port to mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal. </seg>
<seg id="249"> In June, Rio has suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after the Renamo threatened attack on the railway. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Mazang was evasive when asked about that, repeat the Renamo this threat. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Renamo party wanted to &quot;warn the international community that the case in Mozambique are not going well,&quot; - said Mazang. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Instability has increased dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption and the slow pace of development and recently frequent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company Mediacoop. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;People think that the responsibility for the country&apos;s future lies with the Government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,&quot; - he says. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Omar Sultuan, demonstrator, said that people just want stability. </seg>
<seg id="255"> &quot;Nobody cares nor Renamo or Frelimo, they just want the resumption of peace, they want free access to roads,&quot; - he said. </seg>

<seg id="257"> Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the measures taken in the United States to mitigate the rules relating to these devices. </seg>
<seg id="258"> U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided that they remain in &quot;flight mode&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers can already do it during the main part of the flight, but many annoying that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Australian carriers consider this decision by requesting from the U.S. airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to in the near future to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="261"> The Office of Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that the restrictions on use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight is still operating in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="262"> &quot;Managing the safety of civil aviation currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes,&quot; - said it. </seg>
<seg id="263"> This issue is governed by rules that require carriers to enforce security at any time, and from the passengers - to follow safety rules, which they are told crew members. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Company Virgin, which had already discussed with the Office of Civil Aviation Safety increased use of on-board entertainment system with its Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it will follow the instructions of the controller. </seg>

<seg id="268"> Resolution of the FAA applies to U.S. airlines. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly scrutinize FAA decision and the reasons behind it. </seg>
<seg id="270"> U.S. carriers to influence decisions will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, and revise manuals, training materials, the rules on hand baggage and instructions for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="272"> &quot;After the airline check and confirm immunity of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any height,&quot; - said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="273"> In rare cases of poor visibility crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Furthermore, according to the group&apos;s recommendations, heavier devices must be located under the seats or in the overhead storage compartments during takeoff and landing. </seg>

<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog associated with her ​​mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tails to the right (from the perspective of a dog), while anxious dogs wagging their tails predominantly in the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that the other members of the canine may notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain in different ways involved in the formation of motivators that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we tried to look at this and other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that, just as in humans, dogs right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how dogs respond to versatile povilivaniya tails of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals, when they watched movies about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Probably, soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes sent in one direction, and sometimes - in other </seg>
<seg id="367"> Vallortigara professor said: &quot;We showed a video with dogs dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and the tail to send more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="368"> When the animals saw that otherwise nothing expresses the dog moves the tail to the right (from the perspective of the tail wagging the dog), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noticed that the tail tended predominantly left (again in terms of the tail wagging the dog), their heartbeat quickening and they looked alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Vallortigara professor said he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these motions. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what kind of movements they should worry about and what - no. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He says: &quot;If there is a number of meetings with other dogs and often wagging their tail to one side due to the more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts to this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians, trainers and a deeper understanding of their animal emotions. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that it was not the first study to check whether the value for dogs left and right sides. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if looking at an aggressive dog, and right when looking at a pretty dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in other scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he wrote: &quot;Dogs often approached the dog-robot, wagging her tail when directed to the left rather than the right, instead of getting uptight - the opposite behavior with respect to the Italian investigation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not fully perceived the animals in the movies or robotic dogs as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Might be useful study of how dogs respond to these dogs, he said. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;While the various mammals there is ample evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to clarify, and dogs are no exception,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which may be registered in their behavior, probably, soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes sent in one direction, and sometimes - in another. </seg>

<seg id="390"> Last and most tellingly - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants Britain pursued a policy of treaty change and relations with the EU based on trade and not on politics. </seg>
<seg id="391"> This result, which was observed among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insist on a &quot;significant change&quot;, which returns the powers back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The stakes are high - reaching changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the UK provide 16 percent shift in voting for it to stay in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="393"> At the Prime Minister should be no doubt: this poll shows that British business support his plan renegotiation UK membership in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It also shows that a business expects revision lead to a significant shift in this balance of forces back towards the UK. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Best conditions for British business possible and are becoming increasingly necessary to the extent that the eurozone as embarking on the path of closer economic and financial union. </seg>

<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve the traffic problems of large cities were observed in most cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule, it was either on their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about trying to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of vehicles and the time of their use. </seg>

<seg id="488"> Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> In this West African country doctors not so much - just one 5000 people </seg>

<seg id="496"> Dzhamef Bvelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaounde, capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="497"> At first he was just a broken arm, but emerged infection had spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded him of himself until his death. </seg>
<seg id="498"> &quot;In Cameroon, there was no neurosurgeons, - said George Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had money, we would have brought it out of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead Bvelle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment they can get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy - Bvelle said. </seg>
<seg id="502"> - You can leave the house at 5 am, come running to the hospital to be first, but you&apos;re not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Patients very much. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some may die because they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation has not changed much since then, as the father Bvelle died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the World Health Organization in Cameroon is only one doctor per 5,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> For comparison, the ratio in the United States - one doctor per 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them it would not be affordable. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two out of five people in this country live in poverty, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in it are private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;Their only problem is poverty - said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="511"> - And because of poverty, they can not enjoy your life. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen, Bvelle was determined to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="513"> In the past, Dr. Georges Bvelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free transactions. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He became a doctor and running a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="515"> He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people crowd into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit the village in need of assistance. </seg>
<seg id="518"> They are not always lucky. </seg>
<seg id="519"> More than once they had to push the car through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they arrive, they are met, as these heroes: the celebration with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Free medical care in these villages is indeed cause for celebration, and Bvelle his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join in the fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning the team begins to take hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We take 500 people on each trip,&quot; - said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come from all around within 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others may get crutches donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents required for schools that many poor families simply can not afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evening, the brigade conducts a simple operation under local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Transactions are usually held in the school building, municipality, or in the house, after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitizing equipment Bvelle and its volunteers work to early Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This backbreaking pace, but teams usually purposefulness help maintain rural musicians. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They all night beating the drums, so we were up and continued to work&quot;, - said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday, members of the team are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, 700 free transactions conducted over the past year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference for those they help. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One man explained that he received free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;This will change the future for me and my family,&quot; - said the man. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Bvelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="538"> It is this second job, he said, provides 60% of the funding for its non-profit organization, the remaining funds shall be covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I do not even know when he sleeps,&quot; - said Katie O&apos;Malley, a medical student second year Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer group Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="540"> He was always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization to be able to continue these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For future doctors and nurses, such as O&apos;Malley coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bvelle in carrying out its tasks, it is an opportunity to practice, they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We were able to assist in operations, where we helped to remove blood stains or tools to keep the doctor Bvelle&quot; - said O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="543"> As a sophomore, you&apos;d never get such an opportunity in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Student volunteers themselves usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transportation and training will cover Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;He is a hero, no doubt,&quot; - said O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="547"> He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Bvelle almost constant workload is not an ordeal. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Helping others live a happy life, to fulfill this promise to his father - that&apos;s what brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy when I do this work - said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="551"> - And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I do this to people laughing to reduce their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Go to the site ASCOVIME and see how you can help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> For the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States finally stuck a new name - &quot;Fraternal circle&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> This week&apos;s black list &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America is filled with new names and four companies. </seg>
<seg id="557"> The U.S. Treasury introduced a &quot;Fraternal circle&quot; three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and Israelis. </seg>
<seg id="558"> One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, which the U.S. suspected of carrying money to members of the group. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Overall, the U.S. blacklisted 22 people involved in the &quot;brotherly circle&quot;, and six affiliated organizations. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization actually exists. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;Statement of &apos;Bratsk circle&apos; is more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal groups,&quot; - said earlier expert on organized crime and professor at New York University Mark Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="562"> According to him, &quot;Fraternal Circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot;Russian mafia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I never met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or elsewhere who would confirm the existence of a criminal organization&quot; - quoted Mr. Galeotti American Research Center corruption and organized crime. </seg>

<seg id="568"> Thus, the activity of Lasha Shushanashvili Kalashova and Zechariah, added to the list in 2012, was closely associated with Santa Hassan and another participant list Temuri Mirzoyev accounted Santa Hassan nephew. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personality and have no relation to Usoyan. </seg>
<seg id="570"> According to him, all of them combined more general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding inclusion in &quot;Fraternal circle&quot; Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Naturally, we hope to receive from our American colleagues partners more detailed information, in connection with which the decision was made, why it is made ​​in such lists, - said the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the head of state. </seg>
<seg id="573"> In any case he (Leps) is a Russian citizen. </seg>

<seg id="611"> Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden, likely will not travel outside of Russia to testify in cases of tapping of telephone conversations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="612"> According to &quot;Interfax&quot; on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, American can answer the questions of the Attorney General of Germany in writing or in person in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Check out Edward Snowden beyond Russia is practically excluded. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;In this case, he will lose refugee status may be granted to Washington countries - U.S. allies&quot; - a spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="615"> &quot;However, in principle, the Attorney General&apos;s office of Germany could send their representatives to the Russian Federation or to submit written questions Snowden,&quot; - said the source, adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Earlier, the German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebel said that Edward Snowden ready to testify in the case of wiretapping U.S. intelligence talks German Chancellor. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Snowden ready to testify German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Ex-CIA officer hinted that he knows a lot. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="620"> However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival, &quot;- said Strebel channel Euronews. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Snowden&apos;s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the source of &quot;Interfax&quot;, said his client may cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will solve itself. </seg>
<seg id="622"> U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.S. CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, then released information about secret operations of U.S. intelligence by spying on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport revoked, U.S. authorities charged him in absentia serious charges, and the beginning of August remained in the transit area of ​​the airport &quot;Sheremetyevo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="624"> On August Snowden received a document to grant him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day, left the &quot;Sheremetyevo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Yesterday an American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client got a job in &quot;a major Russian company.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="626"> About NSA spying for Angela Merkel last week told German media. </seg>
<seg id="627"> According to journalists, telephone calls Chancellor Americans began to listen to in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Tracking station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="629"> German authorities after the publication of these data indicated that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany. </seg>

<seg id="632"> Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services providing access to the mechanics Bowler Works, logistical support and keeping a car between events. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Drew Bauler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The rally participants traded in Bowler, changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> Some of them are not experienced riders, and people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="635"> We are pleased to offer this way, in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines rally in the UK and abroad, as well as prepare the participants for the rigors and realities of the rally-raid. </seg>
<seg id="636"> We are glad to develop a car Defender Challenge - it will be really exciting championship. </seg>
<seg id="637"> In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Children need to learn the myths and legends as &quot;lifestyle model,&quot; says the author. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Tales of the Torah could show that &quot;brute force can not defeat a sophisticated ruse&quot;, and Arthurian legends show how important it is to have a dream. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Saying that many of the myths will be &quot;too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools,&quot; Crossley-Holland stands for &quot;careful selection&quot; of suitable age texts. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I think it&apos;s wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I advocated the introduction of a training program for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He added that &quot;excessive moralizing&quot; the authors and teachers&apos; discourages interest &quot;in children, and the basic idea of&quot; sublimated &quot;in fascinating history. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Crossley-Holland, who translated the &quot;Beowulf&quot; with the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote &quot;Collection of Norwegian myths&quot; for the Penguin and &quot;British folk tales,&quot; said: &quot;You, of course, may be the intention, but you&apos;d better keep them to yourself. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> Perhaps the biggest difference between adult author writing for adults, and adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil. </seg>
<seg id="647"> And it should be sublimated; disclosed through history, and not clearly articulated. </seg>
<seg id="648"> The old principle: show, not tell. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned of the risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of economic growth in the fragile Russian - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now - not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Recently, it is due entirely to consumption, which is almost never lowers the speed, &quot;- said the chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens Grafe, representing the investment bank last quarterly report on the Russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now the nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With inflation of 6%, it will provide future consumer demand around the current level, expect to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But Russian companies profitability falls, therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimizing staff costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising by 10%, the GDP - only 2% - said Mr. Box. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Company experienced a decline in profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Not to raise salaries Russian business can not commented Barclays Capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment vblizi Historical minimumov, competition rabotnikov vыsokaya. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To entice employees by or keep current, employers have to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia and supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. Earl, because of the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country, this type of lending has not. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;Uses for the growth of consumer credit economy, we have not seen any money do not disagree on the economy, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot;, - said the economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem lies elsewhere - in the Goldman Sachs expect growth delay on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> They take mostly poor people who have nothing to offer as collateral. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Interest on such loans are high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they often do not return, &quot;- said Mr. Box. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of payments on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> HSE Director of the Banking Institute Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of impending banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit institutions without access to cheap resources, which have state-owned banks were forced to raise funds from the public at high interest rates. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, state-owned banks on the warpath, and began to cut lending rates - continues economist. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit institutions may not grant loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If state-owned banks will not abandon dumping Russia threatens full banking crisis, says Vasily Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Deprivation of licenses of some banks in recent weeks economist believes a harbinger of mass collapse. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;Sami state banks with such a situation is not right: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis&quot; - warns the head of the institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But consumption growth will slow and without payments crisis, it is believed in the investment bank - due to the failure of the indexation of salaries of civil servants and military embedded within the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partially shot consumption is mitigated by freezing tariffs of natural monopolies (and, consequently, lower inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partially: if the investment will not grow (and prerequisites for this yet - see reference), consumption growth is still slow, sure Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital sees no prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk - it&apos;s still a drop in oil prices,&quot; - he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> According to him, Russia&apos;s economy will start to decline in oil prices below $ 90. / Bbl. </seg>
<seg id="684"> At Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> There is a paradox: inflation fell, and banks have to raise rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank announced the transition to inflation targeting &quot;- said Clemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The interest rate policy of the Central Bank at market rates does not affect only affects the interbank lending rates. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;For the CB is the collapse of all hope&quot; - praised Clemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Money received in auctions CB banks use for not lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> Once reduced rate, immediately changing exchange rate, which means that means trying to get away in speculation against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work&quot;, - said Mr. Earl and recalled that keep the ruble &quot;free floating&quot; state plans by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But will either have to do it sooner or raise the key rate securities (5.5%), he said. </seg>
<seg id="693"> According to his estimates, the ruble is now artificially inflated by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Ruble is only one way - to weaken, - the expert concludes. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the Central Bank be sown in financiers any doubt that the elimination of the exchange rate band - it&apos;s not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down much stronger ruble. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden agreed to testify about tapping Merkel </seg>
<seg id="697"> Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebel Moscow met with Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="698"> During the meeting discussed whether Snowden to be questioned as a witness in the case of Attorney General of Germany about possible phone tapping German Chancellor spetssltsuzhbami USA. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snowden expressed readiness to provide the necessary evidence. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He made ​​it clear - said Hans-Christian Strebel, - he knows a lot. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander has blocked all his movements, Snowden ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> But first, we need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. . </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding spyware USA. </seg>

<seg id="706"> FAA: &quot;Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but do not call from a mobile phone)&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Airline passengers to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but do not talk on cell phones - according to a long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers should not expect that changes will occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines will have to show the FAA as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for flight crew members and rules laying devices to comply with the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> FAA stated that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;Depending on the plan we could endorse the increased use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; - said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Currently, passengers are required to turn their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door closes. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They do not have to restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give &quot;good&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers are required to turn off their device again when the plane is reduced to landing, and not include them until the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Gleyding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed these changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;After the new policy will be implemented successfully (and we&apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win,&quot; - said Gleyding. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We frankly feel tired &quot;duty to school&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But the connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be smoking at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="724"> So, still no &quot;Words with Friends&quot; - an intelligent online games, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on her smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from an American Airlines airplane for refusing to turn off the device at the time when the plane was at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> A heavier devices such as laptops, still need to be laid in the luggage compartment, as they may injure someone if they fly around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also still banned. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulatory authority for phone calls belong Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="728"> FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national expert on transportation safety CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;Cell phones - it really is a problem, not only because they can potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers, when the plane is in the air&quot; - said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Industry Advisory Committee created the FAA to study the issue, recommended last month that the government has allowed wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> In recent years, increasing pressure on the FAA to weaken the restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Reviews Taki how Senator Democrat enabled shtata Missuri Klэr Makkaskil, utverzhdaюt, chto äë threatened Net veskih reasons svяzannыh bezopasnostью village. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming more difficult to achieve, since the use of devices become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> FAA beginning to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM-radio - high-tech gadgets that time. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they also developed and approved by the FAA, as resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruising altitude for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi-systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices emit radio signals usually much lower power than previous generation devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when flipping pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But the signals become more powerful when the device is charged or send data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those who sought to mitigate the restrictions on use of electronic devices by passengers, was the company Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011, representatives of a loaded airliner their devices for reading electronic books Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but have not found them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Members of the advisory committee, the FAA expressed mixed feelings about that, is there any risk of the use of the devices. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd of the National Association of passengers stated that he considers interference from real devices, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Other members of the committee said that there are only isolated reports of pilots, confirming that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these posts are very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that the FAA allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off the device during instrument landings in low visibility conditions. </seg>
<seg id="750"> A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not inconsistent with the safety and security&quot; - said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Vilnius Moscow suspects in an attempt to defame the Lithuanian president </seg>
<seg id="753"> Russia intends to implement information provocations against senior officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such statement agency BNS made ​​in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB). </seg>
<seg id="754"> Information published on this portal DELFI. </seg>
<seg id="755"> According to the announcement, Moscow intends to &quot;specify&quot; Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archive, which relate to the facts of the biography of the Lithuanian leader. </seg>
<seg id="756"> According to intelligence agencies, preparation of information attack leads Department analysis of public management processes of Russian Presidential Administration for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Structure headed by Eugene Umerenkov, not once visited Lithuania and took part in the Congress of People&apos;s Party of Lithuania. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Also a party to the alleged transaction is an employee of the Department of Smirnov. </seg>
<seg id="759"> According to the secret service, Smirnov undercover scientific work until the end of 2012 came regularly in Lithuania and in contact with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Smirnov now banned from entering the country. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Lithuanian President Grybauskaite eve stated that he knows about her upcoming informatake. </seg>
<seg id="762"> In her opinion, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of the Council of Lithuania in the European Union and &quot;the pursuit of the country toward energy independence&quot; </seg>
<seg id="763"> Lithuanian leader previously has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities. </seg>
<seg id="764"> So she claimed that the Kremlin to Lithuania are &quot;insufficiently respectful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="765"> Furthermore, Grybauskaite accused the Russian leader Vladimir Putin nomination to Lithuania &quot;alone requirements.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="769"> New anti-smoking vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed anti-nicotine vaccine, which could deprive the process of cigarette smoking pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests prior to testing in humans, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We hope that this strategy is the use of the vaccine may finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, having tried all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern&quot; - said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the production of anti-smoking antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain while preventing nicotine smoker strike. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In tests, the vaccinated mice, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="778"> And mice that were not given the vaccine, &quot;relaxed&quot;, and it is an indication that nicotine reached their brains - say researchers. </seg>
<seg id="779"> Эти эксперименты описаны в журнале Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections should have been done so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But more likely it will be used by smokers to quit smoking. </seg>
<seg id="785"> &quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they do not get pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="786"> British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed. </seg>

<seg id="790"> Frontier Airlines will charge you for ručnuû I bet </seg>
<seg id="791"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they are carrying hand luggage on board their flight. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 per cabin and $ 2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday was that passengers can keep the whole jar. </seg>
<seg id="793"> The new fee applies to carry-on bags in the overhead storage compartments so small bags placed under the seat, will remain free. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 if traveling will pay only once at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;Malley said that the fee of $ 100 to take care of passengers should make payment in advance. </seg>
<seg id="796"> &quot;We do not want to charge for it,&quot; - she said. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Airlines started charging for the first and second bag, rent luggage in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Passengers trying to avoid these fees, stuffed as much as they can, in hand luggage placed in overhead storage compartments, which is why in these compartments is often not enough space. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Charges - one of the ways to get passengers to carry less on board. </seg>
<seg id="800"> O&apos;Malley said that this new collection is not really for the sake of earning money. </seg>
<seg id="801"> The fact that the most loyal customers of Frontier declare that find a place in the overhead storage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Passengers who buy tickets on the airline will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="803"> This means that one of the passengers in the queue at the exit for the flight Frontier may be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> O&apos;Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and check-in counters Frontier is intended to ensure that passengers are aware of the collection before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="805"> New Frontier collection for hand luggage will not start until the summer charged, although no date has been set. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on Wall Street believe adding baggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the costs of the flights after several years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> But most of them do not touch fees for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced first collection for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees. </seg>
<seg id="812"> According to his assessment in a report dated December 2011, the fee for carry-on luggage brings Spirit $ 50 million per year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew flight Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection of Spirit in your hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;The process was the smoothest landing of those that I have seen in my career in the airlines,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing was fast.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier also follows the Spirit against fee of $ 2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice can keep the whole jar and topping up the coffee will be provided free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It will continue to distribute free water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but withdrew from the seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Frontier initiative on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airlines - it is a last resort to attract customers to your website. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay online ticket sellers such as Orbitz, from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This gave impetus to all airlines encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them and not to go to the online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> However, Frontier has gone farthest in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September, she started to give half the bonus frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday it had cut the number of miles a premium of up to 25 percent of the miles traveled. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, a trip of 1,000 miles with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would yield 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, passengers can choose their place in advance only if they buy tickets directly from Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> At Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is reduced and becomes unprofitable. </seg>

<seg id="845"> As we understand it, is about a thousand tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Previously, Washington said Assad days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I believe Assad must go. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The question is not whether it will happen, and when it happens. </seg>
<seg id="849"> He is no longer legitimate and must leave. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> And feels more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> His troops are still using artillery, rockets and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> His opponents were scattered and poorly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> His people were forced to leave their homes, many are starving. </seg>

<seg id="865"> Against him was prosecuted under the Criminal Code &quot;Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as the humiliation of human dignity committed in public.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="868"> Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate sex&quot; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with external genitalia intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="870"> Newborns will no longer necessarily ascribe a male or female. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require parents to call a half of these children, allowing parents to specify sex as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; in their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Purpose of the law was to take pressure off parents who can take hasty decisions on the operation of assigning gender to infants and to fight against discrimination of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One intersexual people, according to BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and not a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> I will remain established doctors quilt with bruises and scars. </seg>

<seg id="877"> Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identity is still poorly understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that if sex can not be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of children before surgery, if it happens at all . </seg>
<seg id="879"> New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> Intersex children create an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;Some people have a life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children do not have them,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how personality develops. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science of how a child develops any gender identity, not too accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nobody can answer questions about why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It&apos;s like a mystery as to why people are homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as distinguished from transsexual or transgender because their condition does not refer to gender, but to their biological structure that does not correspond exclusively male or female, as is typical for both simultaneously or not typical for any </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics may occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, breast and body; primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes motivated by prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal have allowed adults to put male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; in its official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, 52-year-old Australian resident Norrie May-Welby was the first person in the world, recognized as &quot;asexual&quot;, defended in court the right to maintain an &quot;indeterminate&quot; sex status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports to be used in the designation of the third addition to the M and F - X, that is intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighboring France gender issues still cause controversy, according to the news release on the channel France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, pronounced this Catholic country, signed a petition for exemption &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we turn two pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also reported the website Baby Zone, that she would prefer to set the floor for children at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; - she said the website for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - on behalf of the beautiful Greek god who possessed the characteristics of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And just ten years ago the medical community sees gender as a sheet, which can all be erased, and then again to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many disputed ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to the perceived gender when he grows up. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;In the middle of the XX century it was called&quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot;,&quot; - said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When these children were born, you do not call a psychiatrist - you call the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory of how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender can be easily altered. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that environmental cues, including social - how parents raise their child - interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person will consider yourself a man or woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case in 1966, known as &quot;John / Joan&quot;, his theories have come under question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised the boy&apos;s parents, whose penis was damaged during circumcision negligent, completely neutered child, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> &quot;Mani presented a case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not so&quot; - said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When he was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and a married woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But at age 38, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survive these sex-change operations, declared themselves &quot;dissatisfied with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> Such was the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but the genitals of an intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The doctors could not determine exactly whether he has had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live &quot;normal life&quot; men. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed Bruce, and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He was given female hormones at age 12. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew I was not a girl,&quot; - he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> At age 18, he was granted a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical records. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he learned was terrible. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born with impaired sexual development which did not give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="924"> After learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Operation made ​​him sterile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Anne Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Bar Association Advocates for Informed Choice, concerned that German law &quot;to encourage labeling and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child&quot; unspecified sex &quot;,&quot; - she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid that it will facilitate the intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to assign a male or a female, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we have not seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do - is to speculate. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Temar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Grown men should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex&quot;, - she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> German law assumes its assignment at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This battle, in which young children should not enter at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about your own body. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, mammolog radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;support&quot; of both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Baratz daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she is a violation of sexual development called &quot;syndrome complete androgen insensitivity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="939"> Since its androgen receptors are not working properly, Kathy developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, at 29 years old, married to Cathy and extends residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy. </seg>
<seg id="943"> &quot;The law gives parents time to not make hasty decisions themselves,&quot; - said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the time interval before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In this case, you are right - to raise a child, like a child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We need not hurry to do surgery, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel like doing the right thing,&quot; - she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Eventually the child decide what floor with him or her more comfortable - and it&apos;s wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> It gives children the opportunity to decide on their own. </seg>
<seg id="951"> U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; in data collection </seg>
<seg id="952"> U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that data collection and wiretapping American intelligence agencies sometimes &quot;went too far&quot;, nevertheless politician noted that appeared in the media about tapping 70 million people is not true. </seg>
<seg id="953"> I assure you that innocent people in the process, not injured, but was an attempt to gather information. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Yes, in some cases, it goes too far, and in a wrongful character. </seg>

<seg id="986"> On Thursday, the Court of Appeal suspended the federal district court order requiring changes in the &quot;stop-and-search&quot; New York Police Department, and the judge dismissed the case. </seg>
<seg id="987"> Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit United States stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal lodged by the city. </seg>

<seg id="990"> On Thursday, the Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on a motion to suspend the case. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The Court of Appeal stated the need for disqualification of a judge because it violated the Code of Conduct for United States Judges and has not considered the need to avoid bias demonstrations, partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court. </seg>

<seg id="996"> The tactic of &quot;stop and search&quot; criticized a variety of civil rights lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="997"> &quot;Stop-search&quot; has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops sharply increased during the administration of an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 the absolute record of 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Hispanics. </seg>

<seg id="1004"> He said this during a dialogue with readers of your page on &quot;Facebook.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors, among which are, inter alia, and customs duties. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> And it will mean that prices should decrease. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;So much for the goods that come from the EU,&quot; - wrote Azarov. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> As for other products, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it is indirect. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> But, nevertheless, there is also not to be price increases. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Therefore, messages on billboards, which recently appeared in a lot of our country, that the association with the EU - is the rise in prices, it is not so, or to be more precise to say - not so &quot;- summed Azarov. </seg>

<seg id="1013"> The federal government insists that the rescue package of $ 325 million for the weakened health system will be complemented by Tasmania stringent conditions which guarantee that the state government will not spend money for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth takes &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and the limitations of the system. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Decision on funding for four years was made after consultation with the Government of independent MP Andrew Wilkie Tasmania. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> &quot;The government has offered a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,&quot; - said today Ms Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Package of $ 325 million includes $ 31 million blitz campaign to elective surgery. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help bridge the gap. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> There is also money for clinics that accept patients without appointment in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after a hospital, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &quot;These investments will be made ​​by the best doctors realization of ideas about how best to help the health care system of Tasmania,&quot; - said Ms Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government will operate in strict accountability and responsibility. </seg>

<seg id="1023"> Will set up a commission of three members, to ensure that staff can provide services as efficiently and effectively. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr Wilkie said today that $ 325 million will not solve anything, &quot;unless they are followed by genuine reform, which will put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to the request for emergency assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I hope that the package of federal aid will contribute significantly to the conclusion of the health system in this state of the critical state,&quot; - said Mr. Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent reductions. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But the federal opposition representative for Health Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;solution similar bandaids.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the state Labor government threw $ 430 million from the health care system,&quot; - he said broadcaster ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, we can not pretend that this is good news. </seg>

<seg id="1038"> I read the book terribly sad these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me in times of discouragement in the second year of medical school and revive in me a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to win&quot; and that a memoir of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Evening when I finish writing reports on my patients and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and performances could be dazzled. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The electoral victory was impressive, and the leading news programs did pause to reflect on this historic moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates wept for joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers that they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> In the White House had to come a young team of strategists, and people were ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> During Obama took office in 2008, his support level was 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Back in the present, is a rude awakening, as pulling out of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> In the years since, as I lowered my first ballot, the changes actually occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It was then that I even could not imagine. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I give Obama credit for his large and varied achievements, from the enactment of affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, canceling rules of &quot;Do not Ask, Do not Tell&quot;, the assassination of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I believe that the party&apos;s obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move our country forward immigration reform, a choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo Bay, among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after countless times when I found myself on the side of the Obama administration, protecting her in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I reached the point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Republican obstructionism can not explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone attacks on innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> He can not explain the data collection on the privacy of Americans National Security Agency or harassment of whistleblowers disclosing government misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> He can not explain the killing of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without a trial or failure limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> He can not justify the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House exerted efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the days of the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And lately he can not justify what you can not develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on access to care. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I do not know that I have to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership can contradict political campaigns that precede it? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Clearly, the work of elective office is not predictable action program, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and random events such as the massacre in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Nevertheless, all these examples I have outlined above it is clear that they were largely the administration&apos;s own choice. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And this is what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Again, I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney was an obscure and rough alternative, it seemed that he was not able to decide on their own policies or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I figured that in his second term Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections meet the expectations that we have heard for such a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, when this week Obama&apos;s rating has fallen below 45%, back in 2008 through this book has become much harder. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It makes me yearn for the many promises that have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton dealt a resounding defeat Obama in the primary election in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At a meeting on the review of the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and to remain faithful to its purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I want us to return our attractiveness, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> - We must remember who we are. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I quite agree with you. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Expressed in this commentary are solely opinions Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> In Egypt, takes the oath first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohammed Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Islamists Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when brought oath, becoming the first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected president of the Islamic Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took the oath before the 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the banks of the Nile, which was built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; - said Mursi during the ceremony shown live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; - said Mursi, 60-year-old engineer with the American form of the &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization , which served as a target for tough action successive </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 am local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time to let his motorcade on normally busy road connecting the city center with its southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although derided as Mursi neharizmatichnoe &quot;spare tire&quot;, &quot;Brothers&quot;, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and Friday performances, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to complete the work uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state&quot;, - said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, the judges in the wood-paneled room, where he took the oath. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> He was given an official reception with military orchestra played the national anthem, during which he stood at &quot;attention.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Attended military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;The army and the people - one hand&quot;, which chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the powers of the president, which was deprived of his post of the military council, who took the case from the deposed leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, and not in front of Parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> It Morsi in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> School of English Literature courses will require that students have studied at least one Shakespeare play, a novel XIX century romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> At the exam will also feature &quot;extracurricular texts&quot; to encourage more extensive reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> Joint course of English literature and language will be canceled. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015, students will be required to take the final exam in a separate language, with strong recommendations selection of English literature as a separate exam. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Department of Education should release tomorrow a new curriculum for English and mathematics - the first subjects subjected to a radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> He will make changes in other essential supplies next year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Separate regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL present a revised structure of final exams of high school, with a new system of values ​​and a smaller volume of coursework. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Speaking summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said he was &quot;a broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that the school final examinations will be &quot;more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week during the quarter) than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For comparison - Australian schools give on average 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore engaged in about 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Although the formal requirement to spend more time in the schedule is not mathematics, coalition sources said that large-scale school final exams in mathematics combined with improved efficiency ratings in the table are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> The curriculum will focus more on &quot;real-life problems&quot;, including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football - reason for discord? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma in the &quot;open platform&quot; policy experts talked about how to maintain national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals was made and such: ban football in the North Caucasus because of this game - some scandals and discord. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded of the recent events in Biryulyovo and said to reduce &quot;the degree of tension in society&quot; politicians and the media must be correct in his statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Perhaps he had in mind the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is one of the television threatened to encircle the Caucasus barbed wire, if there do not want to limit births ... </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All the speakers talked about the measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the nations of Russia, which gave discussions confusion. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulyovo - &quot;conflict model that could predict,&quot; but &quot;for these issues we meet too many people and authorities&quot;, as too many cooks spoil the broth. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which has long practiced in Europe against migrants, according to volunteers, failed, and should look his way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Historian Yury Petrov laid great hopes on the new unified history textbook. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;Still it is necessary to create a manual on the cultural history of the peoples of the country to students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov proposed to criminalize &quot;appeals to the dismemberment of Russia&quot;: &quot;If the U.S. said on the radio that we must pay Russia to Alaska, then you will be arrested and will be given 20 years in prison!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard &quot;not to inflame.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, in all he accused journalists who make patients and acute national problems on the public debate: &quot;In the heat of debate, you never know what can we say!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of the faction &quot;United Russia&quot; Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude &quot;charter&quot; and agree to conduct discussions on this subject carefully, and then the same obligations can take over and policy. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We made ​​about 30 laws that regulate migration, and order in the whole set, said Mr. Vasilyev. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example, he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Lyudmila Andrichenko enthusiasm over this law has not divided: there is no &quot;clear idea of ​​what the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Hence, the subjects will be treated differently scope of these powers. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> In addition, municipalities have no training needed to address these complex issues, no money, and guidelines, which they could use, the center does not give them ... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Gadzhimet Safaraliev proposed to establish a special agency with a formidable name of &quot;Homeland Security&quot;, which would deal with issues of national policy. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s led a similar agency abolished later opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Enough to have a federal special person, &quot;minister without portfolio&quot;, which could be had, if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We go over the edge, torn shells nearby, very important people of different ethnicities and religions stand together against provocations, and this work should get decent information support&quot;, - said the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church Relations Society Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> No neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious, to be, in his opinion, it should not. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Here Oleg Nilov led discussion in unexpected direction: &quot;More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to look for, but they are pushing the wrong way, the wrong way,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;Not that way&quot; - the development of football: &quot;What football player beat the whole crowd, the flags of the harness, the comrades stones throw of each other ... </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe we do not need a football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another kind of sport - rugby is called ... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;Equal they will not be in the world in this sport!&quot; - Spoke warmly spravoross. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Rugby in the Caucasus will not play anybody! - Immediately intervened Mr Zhirinovsky. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You still curling offer them! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Need to know the national peculiarities, it&apos;s like a Georgian &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; offer &quot;... </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl, wild behavior in the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during a game with the local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football will prohibit nationwide ... </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Recognition of the National Security Agency reinforce paranoia corporations regarding public surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> A warm afternoon in late August, the German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> According to the instructions of the Federal Service Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building representation from the U.S., which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media say BfV hoped to detect antenna listening devices, and these actions have resulted in negotiations between the U.S. and the German Foreign Office in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, in September again assured that the United States does not use the foreign intelligence &quot;for theft of trade secrets by foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness and increase their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But since Edward Snowden - a contract employee, became whistleblower - began to publish his treasury U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to trust the director&apos;s word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in cloud services providers in United States, including Google and Yahoo, corporations raised paranoia caused by shadowing the state to new heights. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone was tapped, perhaps about ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, of course, are potential targets, and business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden made ​​evident by intensive cooperation between intelligence agencies and U.S. companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think it is likely that these data are used to mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; - says Oliver Gruen, president of association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT-companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies are convinced that the United States now represent nearly the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency EY. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> All documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, still there was no evidence that the United States passed trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and suggested that he should try to reduce their dependence on the U.S.. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Businessmen are skeptical about this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the German Parliament says that we need to create a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again ... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;This is not an option,&quot; - says Plattner Gass, president of the German supplier of business software SAP. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a need for a strong European IT-industry, should not have let her die more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> All subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> All except IT-industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Nevertheless, coverage and technical development agencies espionage U.S. revelations made ​​famous by Snowden, came as a shock to some of the companies that had previously thought that the greatest risk of surveillance is China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Major shift occurs in cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies better realize that the data stored in the U.S. are in the same jurisdiction, and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to a study conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-US participants abandoned plans to use the services of the US-based provider of cloud after the exposure of the U.S. program for Data Mining Prism. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Sneyb Jim, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: &quot;We see that consumers ask a new question, which did not arise a year ago, namely: where is my data stored and whether you can ensure that they remain physically in this jurisdiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German leaders argue that the latest reports - it&apos;s just a confirmation of what they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, these data should be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> What happens economic espionage - is not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> He always had a place. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;It was a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,&quot; - said Kurt Bock, CEO of chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level, and we also spy on them, because it is in our national interest - to protect our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about those responses that they have taken, as it may provide an advantage to the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Large companies have long been assimilated the idea that stick to take a free exhibition or leave the laptop unattended in a hotel room - it is at least imprudent. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors carmaker Audi, said that for many years it is standard practice - to collect mobile phones before the meetings of the Board, that they can not be used as listening devices. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Federal Protection Service of the German Constitution recommends that CEOs consider using simple prepaid cell phones during a trip abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Prepaid cell phones are thrown out later. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Nevertheless, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in the world market in its particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access&quot; - warns in a report BfV. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> U.S. warns their own company on economic espionage from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> Updated U.S. National Intelligence in February put France with Russia and Israel in the second series of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the worst of all the French.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Skarsini Bernard, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;Services are well aware that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1185"> International Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated because of the fire in one of the terminals. </seg>

<seg id="1197"> Within a few years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease put up for public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Tenants were against it, and wanted a longer lease terms. </seg>

<seg id="1642"> The research is published in Science, online magazine you can read the summary. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to the speech. </seg>

<seg id="1645"> Scientists have found that family members were disrupted gene Foxp2, but how it performs its function remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The new biological study showed that at least part of its functions as a stimulator Foxp2 performs formation of new synapses in brain regions associated with the production of speech. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> He accomplishes this through another gene, SRPX2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The latter was observed as a result of search factors which stimulate synapse formation. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, with only its activity viyaet Foxp2. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> What really affects SRPX2 vocalizations, scientists confirmed in experiments on mice. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> When animal gene activity was artificially reduced, they are less screaming in the separation from the mother. </seg>

<seg id="1672"> Chris said that, as the ice cream begins to glow when reacting to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Charlie, founder of ice cream &quot;Lick me, I&apos;m delicious,&quot; says: &quot;It&apos;s an incredible thing, but still at a very early stage, when it comes to production, so for £ 200 you get about 2 g of the substance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Protein, which we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> Therefore, when your mouth is warm white, it will raise the pH level and ice cream will begin to glow. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed that would be perfect to submit it to Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This is probably the most expensive ice cream from those that I did, because jellyfish luminescence four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> So that each ball cost me about £ 140. </seg>

<seg id="1680"> Experimental Charlie Company, located in Bristol, famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But his next creation should be more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> He said: &quot;I really want to develop the invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1683"> It is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we&apos;ll find a way to do it. </seg>

<seg id="1892"> Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Syria had destroyed all the declared capacity for the production of chemical weapons, recognized Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This first stage of disarmament Damascus completed the day before the deadline. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Before November 1, Syria had destroyed industrial and other ancillary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use, reports BBC BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Destruction of stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components to be completed by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to the OPCW, currently toxic chemicals are in sealed vaults. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> International inspectors went to Syria after the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 during a chemical attack were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The main task of the inspectors was no time to lose - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and weaponization. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> These production facilities will now be closely watched to prevent their repair. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The next milestone - mid-November, by this time the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> There are many questions. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where will they be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide for this equipment? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All applications will be carefully Syrian checked by Western intelligence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They readily advise inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The United States believes that the shooting was carried out by regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist that it is the handiwork of the Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia, - destroy or rendered unusable all the capacity to produce shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for filling shells these substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now, when this stage is complete, the next step should be the elimination of an existing chemical weapons in the Syrian army. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is assumed that in this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, blister agents mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> To destroy it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agreed on a timetable for the start of action - it is given two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Head of Field Operations OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;Now they have no possibility to further production or mixing of chemical weapons&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In a statement, the OPCW said that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the factories producing shells and toxic substances either destroyed or made ​​unusable. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out inspection there, says the document, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by experts of the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was &quot;particularly uneasy&quot; because work had in the context of the ongoing conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> In early October, the OPCW has received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it is time to celebrate the inspectors had not yet found - they were too busy working. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> George Kerewan: the gap with Europe gives Scots choice </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another horror story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> At this time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Comes the turn of stories about the passport control at Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> However, Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of freer movement to the rest of Europe, though - predictably - it does not appear in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> And no one has pointed out that the EU Member States spend a lot of time trying to turn their formal rules as it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Because Scotland is now not part of the Schengen zone, continued non-compliance will be cheap concession to Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So it&apos;s not a worthwhile story. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And so old that it has become a fossil: the first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Yet there is an interesting point, lost in the retelling of old tales. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why does an independent Scotland should execute orders in Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke yoke London Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> That&apos;s true European news: the great postwar plan to unify Europe finally stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With the euro crisis project &quot;Europe&quot; is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Throughout the European Union parties opposed to the abolition of the EU or the euro as the single currency gaining strength. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany eurosceptic party &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; - founded only this year - came out of nowhere and got almost five million votes in September&apos;s federal elections, thus essentially displacing &quot;Free Democrats&quot; (the analogue of our &apos;liberal democracy&apos;) of the Bundestag . </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There has always been internal opposition plan creating a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> However, the current economic crisis was a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters - that German politicians and want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation is in Southern Europe in advance disadvantage manufacturing capabilities in comparison with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only recourse - to cut down salaries and public spending that is actively supported by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> For current budget problems and currency worth a deeper problem of productive capacities in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result, a set of measures to &quot;green&quot; energy embedded Brussels - code meaning subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the U.S.. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> This paralyzing adverse price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing wages in the world will not stop a landslide of cheap shale gas on the U.S. European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result of brewing rebellion, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war, the French political elite views the EU as a way to control Germany and Paris put on a par with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means to gain political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy to Europe, leaving a devastated economy of France in distress. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> Result - generally against the EU party Marine Le Pen &quot;National Front&quot; has just won the crucial by-election, the ruling party of socialists dropping to third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;Front&quot; is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning by the British Labour Party that can not proceed on the assumption that the split among the right automatically affect in favor of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If - and it is very likely - the party opposed to the EU will be supported in this election, the first time such a unit can occupy a dominant position in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my take: soon growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> EU will not disappear, but it will again be a bit vague &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; that appealed to General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and several dependents economies may save the euro, but France and southern Europe to restore their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I guess Britain is distancing itself from the project, hoping to get closer to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that the UK will remain unattended in the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In what position does that leave Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become the region (in fact) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed as part of a free European agreement provided that we keep its currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repetition of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement in Europe directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Scotland would be absurd now to vote for independence only to accept austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2044"> African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that puberty close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence that the blame hormones or other chemicals </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge - journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Should the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of breast and pubic hair to grow at 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Fla., children&apos;s endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American women and are the new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - usually it does not mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,&quot; - said Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;Once the breasts begin to develop, passes through at least two or three years before menarche,&quot; - said Kaplovitts, who is also author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time - the most accurate test of how puberty will progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> There is debate about what is the actual onset of puberty, but it is &quot;premature&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will stop or slow down - this is what the pediatrician may monitor carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> More rapid progression can serve as a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which ultimately can lead to stunted growth and low growth into adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy based on the child&apos;s age, level of development, growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplovitts careful with medications, but acknowledges that &quot;the suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of the girls that they are different from peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Another big problem is clear: parents just do not want to have their very young daughters were menstruating. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with health issues,&quot; - said Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; - says one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> She came home from school frightened and upset by the fact that she was the first among his friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are many theories about the causes publicized early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that the blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual promises in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> The boys - like girls - puberty occurs earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplovitts argues that the premise, which is the most significant - is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which relates the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Worldwide, precocious puberty, appear to affect all from the economic climate conditions and to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another mystery: although boys facial hair and pubic hair appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other physicians participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Acne and pubic hair found even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty,&quot; - said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children&apos;s endocrinologist at Children&apos;s Hospital in Gorieb Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk to your child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;This could mean an earlier than expected, the conversation&quot; - explained Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you keep quiet, your child will usually respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls who blossom early, you need to confirm that even when it comes ahead of this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2515"> Black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> While American designers roads trying to find money to repair crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box, the additionally neatly on the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices that keep track of every mile passing motorists and transmit this information to officials at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing of motorways America undertaken by planners and Washington State. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government to provide the right to use small boxes to keep track of the amount of miles we pass you, and maybe even where you drive through them - and then use this information in the preparation of tax bills. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Tea party movement in shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And although Congress still can not agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They ponder how in the next decade can go to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road, which they pass. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists have already taken to test these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Is it really necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;This is not an issue on which we may be the right choice,&quot; - said Ihrata Hassan, executive director of the Government of Southern California, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, passing each motorist California, in 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Technology for this already. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The necessity of this is compounded by a lack of funds from government funds highway construction, financed by taxes that Americans pay at the gas station. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans do not buy as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars drive more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Sam federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, have not been raised for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians do not want to raise taxes even one cent at high gasoline prices. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;The gas tax is simply impossible to save,&quot; - said Mannich Lee, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In his state was recently installed on 500 vehicles tracking devices for system testing pomilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;This is the best alternative in the long term&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Nerds call it pomilnoy user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Not surprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals, since that tax can change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Planning agencies in California are looking at this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, Rep. Bill Shuster (R., Pa.), chairman of the House transportation committee, said he, too, considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Proponents of the free market in the fund «Reason» also delighted by the fact that force drivers to pay for every mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,&quot; - said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People just pay for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the U.S., which in 2011 called on Congress to move towards pomilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The U.S. Senate approved last year pilot project worth $ 90 million, which would be attended by about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life often have to pass a lot of miles to get to work or to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several states and cities, however, go along this path alone. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The greatest enthusiasm manifested in Oregon, where to participate in the largest experiment in the country involved 5000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon pay staff for a mile run instead of the gasoline tax. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada, a pilot project has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York, it is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> A coalition of I-95, which includes transportation departments in 17 States east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept has not received universal acceptance. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers have recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were worried that the government can track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;Concerns about the&quot; big brother &quot;and things like that is a big problem,&quot; - said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Performance Management in the Department of Transportation Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> It was not what people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When tests were in full swing, branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It&apos;s not hard to turn these devices in full tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2559"> No need to create a huge, unwieldy technology infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep track of the daily movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada - one of the few states where the elusive search conducted low-cost technology that would allow the state government to keep records of passing vehicles miles, but no information about the time and place. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you can do it, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Search of this technology has led some state agencies to small young company in California called True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Originally, the company was not involved in the promotion of tax collection staff. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She tried to enter the growing market of the form of auto insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the device, which it tests, attract designers roads because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with a modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do this if you do not track their speed and do not track their location,&quot; - said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There were several large errors in some of these pilot programs of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers different options. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They may choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they may completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that pass all state residents. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places, hoping to sell the idea wary public, forcing the device to do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop taxable device that will also accept payment for parking meters, provides &quot;pay as ride&quot; insurance pool and collect speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid stoppers. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;Motorists will be to involve benefits that they offer,&quot; - the document says urban design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers transport systems, however, think about the fact, are not all talk about just paying pomilnoy huge distraction. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In urban transport committee in the Bay Area of San Francisco officials say that Congress could easily overcome bankruptcy trust fund highway construction, raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> Additional one-time or annual tax might be charged with the drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, that they pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;No need for radical surgery, when all you need to do - is to take aspirin,&quot; - said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Relations. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Pope Francis call first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Pope Francis in San erect new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first term of his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> The Cardinals are the senior clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they elect popes, so that Francis will appoint its first group of people who will ultimately be involved in the selection of his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Currently there are 201 cardinal. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> However, after reaching the Cardinal the age of 80 he can no longer participate in the election of Pope - is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2586"> &quot;Dad, Francis decided to inform its decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate planning meetings with other cardinals from around the world,&quot; - said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero organization &quot;Catholic vote,&quot; said that by February the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said that Dad usually calls Cardinals as long as necessary to bring the number of new cardinal electors to 120, as well as the Cardinals over the age of 80 years as he wants. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Consistory next year will be very important, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment, there is a kind bias in favor of Europe, and especially in favor of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> In South America, home to forty percent of Catholics, but they represented an insignificant number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> It also will be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking for ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> In the past, the pope decided all by yourself. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;Now Francis chose eight cardinals that they helped him,&quot; - said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> He said that &quot;it is possible&quot; that Francis will appeal to the Cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we have not been in this situation before - all this for us for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valero said that the Pope usually erected office of Cardinal Bishops of large parishes, but Francis&apos; full of surprises - so we do not know who he would call. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="2610"> Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble bursts </seg>
<seg id="2611"> Treasury performed a preliminary assessment of measures to tax on capital gains, but awaits a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a state duty rate of 7% for homes costing more than £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in partnership, rather than as individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Currently stamp duty on residential property in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in 2012/13 fiscal year already exceeds the total of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber together taken. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Mr Cook said: &quot;After the increase the state tax on expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued, regardless of the impact of outdated municipal tax system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2614"> &quot;But this move could lead to the fact that some foreign investors are reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners do not want to sell it,&quot; - he added. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> The cost of prime real estate - the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price - in the affluent southwest London zone that extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, soared by a record 11.8% in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> According to research company Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but they eclipsed actively developing &quot;domestic market&quot; with a spike in the south-west, the north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The next meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers Tyumen Region held on the basis of Yalutorovsk Automobile Plant. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> The event was a presentation of a new line for the production of electric steel pipes. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> As the Commercial Director Denis Gribanov in 2011 with the advent of the new owner of marketing research to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tonnes of electric tubes per month. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Then it was decided to change the profile of the plant and the installation of its equipment to produce them. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Already this year shipped more than 7,000 tons of output. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Investment in plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles - said Denis Gribanov. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> In October launched a new standard that allows you to increase the range. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The plant produces as a small profile of the pipe, which is used to heat individual economy, small forms of construction and furniture industries, and large - for the construction industry. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> Plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons per year, which represents about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not declined - now it is 157 people, with plans to purchase new equipment - Increase staff more than 50 workers. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The enterprise is personnel training and the necessary experts chosen from the existing ones. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> In the future, it is planned to introduce a new slitting steel up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another camp at a speed pipe production to 47 meters per minute. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> By the end of 2014 the company going to master production of pipes, which are used in housing and communal services. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The company&apos;s management sets the task to close to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this production. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Deputy Director of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, referring to the production manager, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of engineering enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> This is the aim and forms of government support of industry, which include the compensation of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> In the current year for this purpose is provided to allocate 150 million rubles, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Last Commission, which will consider contracts subsidy accepts documents from business until November 15. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> In addition, the budget shall be reimbursed the cost of the participation of local producers in international fairs. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> Next year budget provided funds amounting to 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for the lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> 5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - on energy efficiency programs. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Reduced to 72 million rubles funds for compensation ordered and paid for the equipment produced in the south of the Tyumen region for oil and gas industry. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> According to Leonid Ostroumova in perspective, this form of support will cease, since its introduction was motivated compensation tax on mining that oil companies paid to the regional budget. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> At the moment they do not become direct subsidies and expenditure commitments in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> With this in mind, the regional government gives priority to direct support to industry, rather than funding them through the oil industry. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Assistance budget will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Many business leaders have expressed concern about the prevailing situation in the relations with the oil. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Subsidy for the equipment they purchased is a competitive advantage of industry south of the Tyumen region, and its abolition would be difficult to compete with the costs of central Russia, where cheaper labor. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> In addition, uncertainty regarding the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company &quot;Rosneft&quot;, which does not yet place their orders for the Tyumen enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Agreement on the implementation of the Uvat expires in 2013, and the application for its renewal is not received. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Currently, the area south of the enterprise that specialize in equipment for oil and gas sector can not develop a portfolio of orders for the next year. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> It remains an open question whether taxes will go from the extracted oil in Uvat region&apos;s budget or they will be paid to the registered owner of the new fields. </seg>

<seg id="2735"> What will TPU construction in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Every year the city authorities promise to build more transport hubs (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> 2020 is planned to put into operation 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> What actually turns into a project understood our correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago in the metro &quot;Smolensk&quot; Arbat-Pokrovskaya line originated construction fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The inscription reads that goes arrangement transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> It was all very strange, because next to the &quot;Smolensk&quot; no ground transportation stops and therefore can not transfer to him. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, one must overcome the order of 130 meters, including land crossing Karmanitskiy alley. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost all finished. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Faded flower stall dismantled stand for newspapers and asphalt paving stones in front replaced. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> That&apos;s the whole crossing. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport interchange nodes are planar and capital, - explained in the press service of the Moscow department of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> TPU capital unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> A planar involve the construction of parking lots, shopping facilities conclusion that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Actually, plane TPU not even engaged transporters and professional blagoustroiteli overhaul of the Department of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Transport hub - it is not necessarily a complex structure - explains the director of the Institute of Economics and transport policy Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes it is a roof over your head and placards announcing the arrival time of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> For example, at the station &quot;Jasenevo&quot; recently opened completely full plane interchange node. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Let no shelters, but with Bike parking placard and pointing when the bus will come. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of a record number of officials in the TPU everything popadja. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Back in 2011 the mayor&apos;s office had planned to build at all about all the node 151, 59 of them with capital projects. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now plans to appear in 2020 already 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> Hundred and fifty of them promise to pass more this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, not designated any qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the &quot;City and transport.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplants in each of them often worsens. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Criteria, according to experts, should be two: First - time reduction transplant, and secondly - convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport, without going under the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow, the regeneration TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> A striking example of the metro &quot;ENEA&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Earlier shuttle buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now they stop moved to the opposite side of the street Yaroslavl Cosmonauts. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Farther from the subway, much farther from the monorail, but closer to homes. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Services that residents did not want the bus station and complained about the windows in all possible instances. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital TPU in Moscow at once is not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them began to build five years ago at the station &quot;Glider&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project was intended to be a model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And really get a sample of how interchange node, farmed out to investors, turns into a banal shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, there is a bus platforms, canopy, not to go on the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> However, Khimki trolleybuses number 202 and number 203 in Moscow TPU place not given principle. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Others pushed them as far away from the metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But more space under the trade remains. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Only one clothing store 32, and in general have almost everything - from pet to dealership. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well, in fact, if someone from the bus passengers need to buy a new car in the driveway? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> We when building major TPU somehow always turns mall. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the car park have decided to give a market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Glider&quot; marked on the floor of parking spaces is a brisk trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, speech and non-Russian guards, glancing angrily at our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Interchange node finally turned into a bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The fact that earlier in the metro &quot;Glider&quot; was a market, but it was demolished. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> And in the prefecture and regretted traders allowed to intercept parking transportation hub. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Anyway because of the high prices there is always empty. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place a new plane ... TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Such is the reshuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At Metro &quot;Kaluga&quot; approach distance from the lobby to the metro bus is 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU distance increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> To get on the bus, you must go through the entire mall. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 22 hours, when it is closed, we have to get it in the open. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> However, construction on the &quot;planar&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; soon seem flowers. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> In mid-September of urban planning and land commission approved the mayor&apos;s office and planning solutions for the first eight capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25-storey, except for two or three storeys underground. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> The main monster grow at the station &quot;Tushino&quot;, it will be 418.7 thousand square meters. square meters. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Representatives of the directorate of railway stations Railways responsible for the construction of TPU in the metro, has told reporters in future high-rise buildings will house shops, hotels and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> With officials claim that stacked parking will take a third to half of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Take for example the &quot;folk&quot; garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Say, a garage for 258 parking spaces, which recently built at the International Street, has an area of ​​8015 square meters. meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So, parking space for 2,6 thousand cars in &quot;Petrovsky-Razumovsky&quot; will need about 80 000 &quot;squares&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Less than a third of that colossus that there are going to build. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Let one or two floors will be used for all sorts of platforms for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Remains of at least 150,000 square meters. feet of commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> And this, for a moment, almost two GUM. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> If capital TPU at stations and railway station building, the rest of the site will develop metropolitenovtsy. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> They also promised that there will be many &quot;objects functional purpose&quot;, including hotels, offices and even gyms. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> By the way, in the Department of property of Moscow recently told reporters that drafting a resolution under which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Without tenders. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city - a priority. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> Perfect TPU - this, for example, the station &quot;Harvard&quot; in Boston or &quot;Spadayna&quot; in Toronto, - said Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> There trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and approach distance from subway car to the tram is just 50 meters without going outside. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Around any extra trade. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> But Moscow officials rush to extremes. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Either nothing will build or too otgrohat 25 floors with offices and apartments. </seg>
