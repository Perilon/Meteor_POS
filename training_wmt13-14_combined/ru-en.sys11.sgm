<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified its policy to fight the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But in the centre Brennan the final myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more than the cases of death from stroke of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By the same lawyers for the Republicans were only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: this new trend will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American States was responsible for organizing the elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most of the governments of the States with 2009 pass laws, complicating the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon new scope after the elections in November of 2010, which brought Republicans the 675 new seats in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The result for 2011 alone was passed 180 bills restricting the right to vote in the 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of us citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws reduce the period of early voting, eliminated right registration of voters in the day and will take away the right to vote with the citizens, have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 2006 elections no us state is not obliged voters to present photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana the first state, which has adopted such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The us Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican power to extend this to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years, they have laws requiring voters to present photo identification, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec American citizens do not have universal proof of identity, such as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American people, that is, 21 million persons who are necessary for the voting age, does not have the identity card with a photograph of the government of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, 5 million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required proof of identity are often more than $ one hundred. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income communities. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 did not have the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters, which is believed to vote for Democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph of their educational institutions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But the same States allows members fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mostly Republicans, to be used for voting of the certificate issued by the clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no state did not require proof of us citizenship for voting. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The first time such a requirement was imposed in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are us citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This, obviously, is designed to limit the vote of the people from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, eliminating the registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction did not pass without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make lists about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early, were African American, although the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike White, who, forming, 76% of voters among those who voted early at only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, legislators - Democrats and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several pieces of legislation was governors Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Action the most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the President of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has enabled in part to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules, which came into effect, of course, would hamper the implementation of the vote in the 2012 elections. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Of criticism from Democrats condemn the bias of the law, which was adopted, seeing in them a clear direction, trying to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Report of the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that states, these laws, who represents 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with confidence that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: the new provisions would have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: to be tested or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test for dog gives sometimes erroneous results, negative, and sometimes positive, which leads to wasteful medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctant to pass health exams, and there is good reason to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To be tested or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We ask two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> a study in the United States, has seen numerous cases of infection among groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to establish any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also found, after a 12-year-old observation that the odds of metastasis 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to be tested since 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men of African-American descent are at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decisions, as cancer found. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive, and semi-dormant. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to explain the risks of his cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men, who identified cancer, will not get treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will be offering active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still to be tested. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created, to assess the pros and cons have a test on him. </seg>

<seg id="73"> To prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe, to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite progress of scientific research, and of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if everyone had had enough and was moving, about 30% Del raco have been averted. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, the figure rose to at least 50%,&quot; said Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, the estimated 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remains utterly inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains the priority, despite a decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking related to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is a colossal damage the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today in Quebec has 1500 thousand smokers,&quot; says spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting at risk from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The car, overweight and obesity also contributed to the rise of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> It increases the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime, and protects against Colon cancer,&quot; says the Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> Association also consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large amounts it increases the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Avoid also increased. </seg>
<seg id="94"> In the meat by smoking, drying or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; says the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists are engaged in the research of the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies mixed. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Scc according to the study of the vitamin E gives conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of the vitamin D is also a lack of clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their fears and family history is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Testing does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer to suggest that scientists may have been able to find the Higgs boson, caused this boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that the bosons explains the bulk of the particles in the universe, nothing so much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Moreover, this is the last part, the existence of which predicted by the standard model is our best, or, in any case, &quot;The least imperfect&quot; description of nature and behavior of matter, but that is something we have not been able to find an experienced by. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But are not yet sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with really new particles and that she strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is clear that, although to be sure, some data is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Will provide all the same, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to make a mistake seems minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world one law is inevitable, saying that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule, there is no way they are not trying too hard, otherwise it will hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But while particle physics is a strange world, it turns out, that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of excluding Realencyclopädie, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;Quantum state&quot; is &quot;Condition&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The particle physics divided into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we are good citizens, called, which was obey the principle Realencyclopädie. </seg>
<seg id="117"> On the other hand, tend to like the infamous mob of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they may instead be water and the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The site (by the way, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, like this, in turn, is divided into two groups: mesons, who we will not speak, and &quot;Particles of force,&quot; which extends the main force of nature and to which in some ways include Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The very least, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creature, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read the story, it is for one incredibly banal Beauzon: the photon, or &quot;Particles of light,&quot; which is &quot;Courier of&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when one is known, with electrical charge, is accelerating or changing direction, it is &quot;Violating&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, the way a stone thrown down in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> The &quot;Violation&quot; is born electromagnetic wave of (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this surge is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the headline of &quot;Carriers of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that, if those Beauzon appeared, should be &quot;Broken&quot; another floor, Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field far, far more stable electromagnetic fields; to take, to achieve very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond surface, which could only be shaken by a very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need huge of particle accelerator, like those that have been operating at Cern - large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such an enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and Mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, and there is no piece of paper, for example, never itself will not be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs, he will interact, wealth, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;Can do&quot; all these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used to test whether the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists to find the gap between the observations and predictions see. </seg>
<seg id="133"> In fact, some of them passionately wants such discrepancies are discovered, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for &quot;New physics&quot; and to plug some holes of a model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The last, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh - oh!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But the Cern of such conflict is not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories would not assume that the revolution would cause their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their application in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960, was invented the laser, and who developed the first continuous laser (previous was a pulse) in 1962, said the originally laser was seen as a &quot;Laboratory gadget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Uilliard Boyle at the time of its optical research in 1969 developed a sensor light. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The sensor, though it was not its original intent, now serves as &quot;Eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;Debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate is soon to be back in the meantime, a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless in this critical area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; tried to look out for. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Has lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, destroyed his inside, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I gave five years, I have had seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care viktar - Gadbua in Beloeil, where profits before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its work: the incredible weakness, which do not let yourself go to the bathroom and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting on the table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to feed. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He is facing us, even manage to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, made him the drugs, lead him in a bathtub. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage to death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest wish to have recovered from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Few hours after staff found a cure for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of life teaches us that a man must urinate standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter of Victor - Gadbua. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress to the condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It all depends on the person&apos;s ability&quot; to come to terms with the decline, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> As, according to many people in palliative care, an important event happens in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients palliative, which goes to the orphanage viktar - Gadbua, all had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Projections giving them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more assistance, called &quot;Therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. A., 89 years old, are most afraid to die &quot;In awareness from suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me start. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I do not want to live,&quot; she said, before being allowed to put her mask to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It is still waiting for the final days of the recent visit of his son, who came from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the orphanage viktar - Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which is when that nothing can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants have a place in the field of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Then life goes on in the best conditions, which is possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors of the shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether comfortg physical, emotional or mental. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we would agree to provide oral rinse of Brandy or Pepsi, watching that he will ask. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetikov we do not make sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, we served beer, Mr. H., who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son, swilled down a beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We are close, as well as patients,&quot; says Natalie Savart, director of patient care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the orphanage viktar - Gadbua no day is like the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Near the 93-year-old man, who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the yard, Party on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and try everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In recent months from three to five beds, is busy cancer patients under 45 years of age&quot; - looking says Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients, taken to a shelter viktar - Gadbua, come from homes, and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, or care, which is given to reduce the suffering, who entered the final stage of life, for example, at home, in the hospital or shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some others, such as shelter viktar - Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home to a large Montreal are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this a large gap in the health care system of Quebec has led many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of the law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October is a manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr Balfurom Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant and indicating their disagreement with such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> In the words of Dr. Christian Martel, the health care system of Quebec doing enough to secure the right to palliative care of high quality, before the transition will be allowed to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the intensive care unit, in terrible pain, and no one had taken the necessary measures to ease. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients want to die, only because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists until the last day are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hope of survival Ellen Richard has already been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist, I stop treatment, she said, sorry that I am giving up the struggle, she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> All-powerful care not. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, the way they did not fulfill their request, after the team in palliative care for their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Fujio she Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at the home of a Montreal, patients are not susceptible to disease prevention in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> In the end the lives of physicians often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the time of his death, or from time to time, or time. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Can no longer pretend that we do not know about the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, there is always the same: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I thought I had an euthanasia,&quot; which means &quot;I want I became easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible by the journalistic Grant from the Institute for the Study of the health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real-estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, of the political parties and the Italian Mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous &quot;System,&quot; entangling the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry,&quot; which is proved costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how soon this system, after in the case all means, joked Jacques Dyusheno, deputy and former chief of police of Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011 as scandal is a by-product of the investigation of official misconduct related to road construction contracts in Quebec, Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Report Dyusheno&quot; established direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only to the Department of Transportation would retain the $ billion in contracts,&quot; had kept their instincts to take part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;Has already shifted two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that it can &quot;To uncover the scheme, behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The case became, in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit, which includes extensive state of government auditors, criminal investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, employees of a special unit &quot;Hammer&quot; after 2009, made &quot;Sewage cartel of&quot; Montreal, to stop inflating the value of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks have been produced a series of searches, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard muster with - mayor of a small town, were indicted on fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> On the list - Gilles Vaillancourt, recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest cities of the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> His suspected of taking bribes of more government orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, the indictment charged with several engineers of Service of transport of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last detonated the bomb, after an investigation of &quot;System of&quot; receiving government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Zambito for several years to 3% of the value of the contracts, signed in Montreal, a mediator, associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, sent money to the mayor, Gérald Tremblay &quot;United Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000s Zambito money and he spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) in various parts of the province, mostly liberals, then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Moreover, he admitted that he was illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party natali Normando. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts, in which the inflated price. </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, &quot;System of&quot; corruption has worked incredibly well. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Syurprenany, a former civil engineer for construction, has described her before the Commission over the ten years he has received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to travel, play golf, in restaurants, on matches on ice hockey and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 for sewer contracts, money which he over-valued. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that he took on his paw, account for 30-40% with the help of false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> One organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of the parallel budget, the party&apos;s office of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After the revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal, who in alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the District of Rivière - des - Preri in the east of the island, it faces from the 2010 sale of municipal area, bought for $ 5 million and sold for... 1600 thousand developers in the midst of a construction boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She said that the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it &quot;Will pull the plug, to further understand the functioning of the system, the swarming ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process she described as &quot;Painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will be necessary to have their own investigative team and Observer, in order to avoid questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we go back home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacque Dyusheno notice for its part, that &quot;Officials stole hundreds of $ million,&quot; but it is concerned about the role of the &quot;Elected officials who knew about the scheme,&quot; but not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec is 70%, he joked: &quot;I was told that it was merely a reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec has to limit to $ 100 of the donations, but, he said, it would not change the situation: &quot;So far we are not going to limit election spending, in politics, will be dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of the award of public contracts and financing of parties: &quot;We can not go below; you should do, we will be able to build a home on a firmer footing, with the best control and rule of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history and casts doubt on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyusheno call on those laughs, to look to their own yard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;- not Paris St Germain FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you are in Paris St Germain has made extraordinary scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and a new dimension Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profits great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Beside them I am growing every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also much added. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors makes me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything was happening very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I did not have nothing. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the start in the centre of preparation in nif is acting as in Klerfonten&apos; and before my arrival in Saint - Etienne I have always walked forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Increase this summer is not a surprise to play matches a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> As a result, the player, as I want to be at the level and be made available to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti support in my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He helps the deputies, as claude Makélélé, who played in the position where I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti - control of the market? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the first League there is no equal and it is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was encouraging conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I was recovering from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Trust, which it turns out, also explains my achievement. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="279"> The first League Lyon took from us the leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is of Champions League: we effectively constitutes a 8th final. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to be as widely as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> All can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to have its say face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in a 8th final. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether Paris St Germain to become a top European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has already there are budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make this project a real. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the first League, as in the past season, will be a failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we actually earnestly hope to win the world title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were to this close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In may, was disappointed, because we had all, to reach the finish line first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points suggest the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But elsewhere, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think, are going to be all right. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title came as such a strong team, Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the power to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much as we do and what players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit sad. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what in the first place are waiting for people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend to 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We do not F. C. Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We proved in the League of Champions, that can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons can not seem to get to the last 8th final, although they have spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead in the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would disregard for our opponents and to the French. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who was not at the height of last season, was &quot;Awakened&quot; this new Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows how exciting first League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Paris St Germain, it seems, from the exploits zlatan ibragimovich. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And that if they say that there is a &quot;Zlatanozavisimost&apos;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this and he proves that he is a huge star League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star of a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The group we respected as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respect the people that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did, it is really only. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others to improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have experienced Euro -2012 with France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I very much wanted to participate in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw there are many things, and I came back stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play good qualifying matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped for with the moment of my baptism in Blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned some lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we now have to behave in an exemplary manner. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama led Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position to qualify for the group to the Championship. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He strict coach, he is close to the players and inspire victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not like to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has achieved its goal, he qualified us in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> a deserved draw out (1-1), October 16 in Spain are fundamental game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> That gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> The shock in Spain, in my career there was no such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> To pay and sell without the aid of banks - with all </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the Monetary Exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties C fees for processing. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, all, invented. Satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros...) and secure exchange like Bittorrent, which allows for the sharing of files between participants a level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15,000 computers in networks. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take a venue for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Course, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June of 2011, five months later, fell to $ 2, before today to return about $ ten (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> It was nothing compared with the global exchange real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes whaling as &quot;The most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;Competing with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;Like a common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as &quot;Credit&quot; used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes to trade). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the operation of the exchanges are always in control and handle any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In Bitkoyny all parts of the network is simultaneously holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers of currency, buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> As running the network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only payment for each user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> a set of information relating to the deal, sign up for e-mail, using the system of encryption with dual-key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can also check the authenticity of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that a venue in the deal, really exists in the public accounts book, was sent across the Web. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Key stage is the registration of new transactions in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through mathematical task, which was distributed to computers, determined which, like a temporary central bank, will receive the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about phase of hash of the file, that is the transformation of a large file in digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;Take&quot; new transaction and add to her room, before &quot;To be hashed using&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find, which offers a unique digital signature (many zeroes in the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as it is found, among other sites easily verify that it correctly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction thus are inextricable linked with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user to lie very quickly (less than ten minutes) would be willing to pay twice one and the theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Computer, ready to challenge for 50. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the rewards are divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Number in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but it is one-millionth, leaving a pool... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the task also increases with the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites, providing the services of all, was attacked, and a stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The defect is not for the Protocol&quot; - said Pierre NUAZ, which recently launched Paymium - company engaged in payments real money with the use of a network you. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through these anonymous Service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But money also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuses to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as Wordpress blogging platform, their permitted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from weitzmann in Israel, analyzed by the book and found that almost 80% does not exist in turnover. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Huge sell-off&quot; was announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;30 thousand dollars was traded,&quot; rejoice jonah holmquist, working in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre NUAZ, the other author of books on the currency, firmly believe in the potential of this technology as the operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (and money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but she uses need to review the transaction, which thus are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The better control their personal data and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not have to set a new device or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough to tell the address, which you can &quot;To photograph and recognize&quot; the phone, says Pierre NUAZ not to worry, because he already has thousand users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of a more conservative. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before you is established, it will take some time, but 2013 will be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in his report suggests, by the way, to reconsider a variety of risks, which is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What is next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa province and Surob&apos;). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan Army it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We suffered in a major Afghan peasants, which we considered as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> We, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and disabled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it did with the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their tradition, old and archaic, even if they are joined by, jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Their suffering, they sometimes helps local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will adopt a delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nidzhrab, which I watched from the hills with almond trees by the French loans, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles to escort helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since the days of their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking them under the control of the country then be seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the bigotry of the peasants, in which they were full of al - qaeda, but their condition has improved and these days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They had turned into traders, exciting state land to sell them under construction, with its return from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American contract manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited; most of them, by the way, even have not. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in rural areas, like the government, consisting not of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who have managed the American generosity: the outflow of capital are significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world in a time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are 5 million residents, one 5th of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in towns filled, both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs for the young people who do not want to go back or to bigotry of the old parties, nor for the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represents the modern world, and is looking everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment the army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Power, which will be her to command, would that be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Old commanders, conducting anti-Soviet struggle, had already taken measures to restore the provincial militia, which would not be reported to the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, mountainous country with a strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, in the manner of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, by Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country, since the 50s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industry had not been on their feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> All imported; nothing is done, except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> It was rumoured that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It is only strengthened the impression that Western countries were there, only to their own. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, without the means of transport, in order to export them through the mountains, there is a production. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese lindsayalmost left field of Aynak copper months, leaving international archaeologists (world Bank-funded) to dig into a huge Buddhist complex and to be the largest employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> , too, needs to be in one day equal attention from Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat units on November 20. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, the faculty at the University of the French language, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009 in an effort &quot;To win the hearts and minds&quot; to do the impossible task of reconciling with offensive operations, Service &quot;Civil - military activities&quot; under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), closed in 2012, along with a small French public organizations, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of Agriculture in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, with intense involvement of local labor force, could help stem the rising: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, the protection of soil and increase the amount of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> We will leave it to the memory of their own, spending 2 billion euros on military spending? </seg>

<seg id="451"> Heavy delivery of the Constitution of Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily give him emergency powers, he decided to play vabank. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text of the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal controversy. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> In the opinion of his opponents, President, persisted in his &quot;Autocratic Brédou,&quot; while continuing to violate &quot;The word&quot; and &quot;To flout the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> In the camp of his followers believe it is the way out of the institutional and political crisis, hastening the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> The referendum should be held within fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> a very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon its intention to explain the Egyptians text, article-by-article. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For president is also to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent raging across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The call to vote like an ultimatum of the Egyptian people, &quot;Or you vote for my text, or I keep emergency powers,&quot; which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> In this strange atmosphere of the 85 Assembly members, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals have not responded to the challenge. </seg>

<seg id="724"> In recent days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the Corporation&apos;s Walmart stores and restaurants of popular networks of fast food, such as &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell,&quot; &quot;Uendis&quot; and &quot;Kentucky fried chicken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> No one is ready to predict, will become if this wave in 9th shaft or it is destined to become obsolete in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares support unions and a number of left-wing social organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In improving the modest salaries, which are ordinary workers Walmart and a system of fast food, the aim of the protests is the creation of them trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> As this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America was hit by an orgy of-sales, coupled with millions of people and sometimes with hardcover editions. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which around the world try 2.2 people, have left their jobs and had picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists of the company, whose products are for people with modest and middle-income countries. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many low-wage workers Walmart come only on the job. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Availability and goods made a Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> , critics say, Walmart can afford to sell goods off in part because little pay their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about the harsh working conditions, for example, the shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the shares in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; was to increase salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by, jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> a typical worker Walmart, receiving $ 9.5 a hour, the expense can not afford, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase the minimum wage to $ 12 a hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart will pass wage growth at the expense of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> a year they will have to spend some $ 12.39 more than... </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters Walmart, a noted that the protest occurred only in nine states and corporations did not cause any damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday, to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In its cash registers in &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 of the transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the Corporation Deng Fogelman claimed in an interview left the site the Huffington Post that jobs left a total of &quot;Less than five&quot; Walmart employees, and that the protest was just &quot;Another public relations stunt&quot; for her Union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests have continued this week in New York, where the object was no department stores Walmart (their progressive in this town do not complain about, and it is not), and &quot;&apos; ses&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Mcdonald&apos;s says that he sold billions of meals, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> In the current minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants eventually increasing it, but not much, and their average ordinary workers are in New York on $ 8.90 a hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less them in this expensive town do not earn no one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As you can exist in New York for the money, to me, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through &quot;&apos; ses&quot; there is been almost a quarter of American teenagers, which job for their shelves after school, living with her parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few saw this as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I am constantly thwarted by interviews with employees of &quot;Makdonaldsov,&quot; which complain that they have to live on the salaries and sometimes even to feed on her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, the Forum of a Wall Street Journal commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know what you will be their stomachs. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Of the protesters, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday the &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; on 40 Street and Madison Avenue, insisted that the cashiers and chefs of the system of fast food began to pay at least $ 15 a hour, more than doubled their current minimum wages. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the area of fast food was created by Labor Organization. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits it to prevent and punish union leaders harassed and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration is rarely easy life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to cover Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - extraordinary turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The dissenting </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in the day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the shares in the mid-afternoon rally in &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; near Times Square, where several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said: &quot;Mcdonald&apos;s&quot; says that he sold billions of meals, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrantov supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio, which said that &quot;We must all join in support of the workers of fast food, so that they have achieved fairly and economic well-being, which deserves every new.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the events of the New York Times, it was the largest this kind in the history of American sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it had only a few hundreds of people, and not all of them were quick to the public, in which workers in New York employs thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is unclear whether this would create a spark of the movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as there are brain receives medium&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately taken to treat mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then, in November, it became known that the application for the patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> But from a conversation with the head of the group interactive 3 D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi is that scientists piercy points - time passed. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Their lures the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell, please, in general terms, what do your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are human interaction with machines, but has been trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> As long as mankind in the group stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking a finger in them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years and to predict radical changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, Xbox and sensors kinect is a step forward, and almost every Xbox today without kinect is not for sale, for all the interesting sign management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - That is the way forward? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite the fact that kinect juliana cooperation on a physical level, much still have a flat screen, sometimes in 3 D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of the data has improved (system get more data), and the conclusion is. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change, is working on a-D systems display on the basis of various technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more visible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in far more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost to hell with the stupid helmet of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> Popular thing, but do not overestimate whether or not it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It certainly can not be called a panacea - question of Privacy, because they do not always want to be around them about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over, and over such a short, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures he did not have a camera, a device and wrist bracelet that monitors the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> He is great, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But the future for a type of mixed management, for example, a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Is how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, as you ask me to convey to you the banks of a soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the same time will tell. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just said. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, it will be very difficult to discern. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not for the moment, the car? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - It is not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think, in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will be used to shape the reaction of the people. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they provide a good resolution depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we are talking about your work with sensors Xbox kinect, what you claim to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do not have permission, depth or something? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle the current generation is the thing, which can make a start in our work over-recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not megapixels, and as the Matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work, the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Had to remember not only about resolution x and y axes, but Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Is also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movement of persons a dynamic, and the 30 K / with a clearly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes from our Redmondskiy laboratory made the touch with adjustable delay in processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) share. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Do not all understand how this affects the interactions between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, but does not require its that frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And the number of cameras to increase not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - Kinect now there are three &quot;Camera,&quot; one of whom - infrared emitter, and the second receiver of reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is, in fact, see the normal range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially large number of cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate her, increasing extent required calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be possible to create a flexible analog kinect, to play with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help in identifying the top of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented the public for their points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Not you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the time to walk around with a smartphone in his hands, not very comfortable, but that is what I think: the most drastic option would be &quot;Rolling&quot; augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could switch with glasses on the Web, head-up display and a lot of other locations. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points is a very personal device, in which the forces of the (private things only see you), and, at the same time, weak - augmented reality on the basis of points will allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let us imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air from the Tony stark of &quot;Iron man,&quot; but mere mortals. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often critics of such ideas: no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing to the challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is the 7th breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think, 8th may well be adaptablements of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> It is an interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a background in image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is registered doubleckick! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is technology, which is aimed at giving these &quot;Pictures in the air of&quot; tactile feedback - interference for example, several targeted ultrasound beams at a certain point where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak - as if you blew over the ball. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Made him think that he feels the fact that they would feel at the moment when he see? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is another task, which is to beat long - how to make people, are physically present in very limited space, to believe that he is open, almost endless - working on the idea of running tracks (not like the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While not fool the brain is obtained medium, the work is still very much for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That do work on the virtual reality such attractive to researchers - many things in absolutely its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Were instead of culture - rosbalt. Ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continue the project &quot;Peterburgsky avangarde,&quot; dedicated to the citizens, which is ahead, at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The top list got bright people&apos;s art scene. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the town, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing Russia acknowledged. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; - controversial artist kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town know kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed all in pink, which meet the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and Vernissage. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Picture of kirill Miller always a crowd of spectators, wherever they may be exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of a St. Petersburg social, philosophical fortune, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Moreover, he is a man of the City, his appearance on the streets of smile among the citizens, raising the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took the hands of the pirate radio and became St. Petersburg at, as ripe for this complex role all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill, and why are you still go to town is Red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red as a fashion designer, in form and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world Red is a compromise between the artist, fashion designer and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> The society all, not a bit of gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocation aimed at giving began the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when you realized that there should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition at the Theater nevsky, where it was displayed my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I felt it my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then wave old free unofficial artists and new, free type I had vague. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with artists of new wave, with, which led to &quot;Pushkinskiy -10,&quot; and more wave was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I get into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, in words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it is all up in your art - clinic... - I was important to go to the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where you will have to collect all the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin -10, and there was no repairs, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg s. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were born: prefectures, tequila - Jazz, remember, like cord led the &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang with plywood of songs, they were in a tight tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band played live, she became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was leading many programs to Khali - Galichskoye Times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and upbringing he we have received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;137,&quot; the club of &quot; Griboedov are echoes of art - clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> To our employees and manner of tortured left. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I hero of the century, when the culture is to mean anything. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the 2000 survey was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the &quot;Artist of the year&quot; was named I ended my peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In New Times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity is divided, it is possible to be popular, but the not - so-cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work in time-honored fashion. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my picture - it hits, a strong and relevant. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be software exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used social were now to be this is hurt and scared. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns all brains splattered, the tragedy are off. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, save the world by totalitarian ones, by order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now on clothes found that focuses on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, maybe he can not throw away and Roger spit it. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed with the help of dressing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - And we recently saw you in the role of urban -. - cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> It is not for me, they have to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Commercial art should be accurate, nice, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people crowded flocks, La bohème one loved, the simplest of them other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all crashed on complicity, it is hard to enjoy all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I do not each piece of paper everyone to like. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now need to think, would be like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now every cult hero to 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to Stas mikhailova come for several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> Has come soon, there is sex - social work. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 will not come, and ultimately less management, money, all languish. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing they do not be fooled, do not want to spoil the family. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in my youth such picture, saying that one collector they are on the wall next to Falk and larionov hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, which usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confusing. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Said: spiritual culture, a culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, it is from other opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture of yesterday, up examples of artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, uses the money for drawing of the paintings. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Kirill, what is missing. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a notion: official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can be done by culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the Kings all is not as it was, the Kings, maybe not quite sure in culture, but they felt the need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We in St. Petersburg people eat, which could be experts, but they are pushed, as more high experts that will evaluate these experts, and give them the road. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thriving. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but their different than what they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists, which must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What-you - petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petersburg - this is not a cultural capital of culture, in Moscow, much more, where the soil is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones art to grow difficult. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural soil, and we writers now more than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe so many people curious. Who attend exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> But this layer thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Implemented at the expense of Grant St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Was born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Land in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid - killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of the space with the Russians on board sets off to find spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a key question, as to continue its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact this planet only two, which can be used at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is Venus and Mars,,&quot; said senior researcher at the National Institute of astronomical P. K. Sternberg (under) Vladimir Surdiny. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if Mars conditions more livable, then on the surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can live only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... In space. </seg>

<seg id="943"> a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> four generation raised on the orbit of Peas were no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - launch of the insects, tiny fruit flies - fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Into space in 1979 sent a couple of quails, to see how to develop an embryo in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get out is absolutely normal chicken. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem with the chicken should find a support, he should get back on their feet and start moving,&quot; as head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (ibmp) ran volodymyr SYCHOV. </seg>
<seg id="950"> For support, the Chicks are not around. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And 10 hours, a newborn was full of atrophy of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The Chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that the next day they were just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice we study the eggs, then refused, because you can not just there to work with them&quot; concludes, the failure of the experiment with eggs in space volodymyr SYCHOV. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals last biological &quot;Mining&quot; in an orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But on the satellite &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment on rats, which is sent into space since the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It is just been on the Biosatellite program - but again, is an one-off experiment, and such a study to be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir SYCHOV. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing from space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to approach the problem of any reproduction directly into space until it receives. </seg>
<seg id="963"> an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, usual habitat, simply can not fulfil their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But, unlike animal, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and in a position to create a proper emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But a woman in space travel for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk had tereshkovoy. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious of humanity, is a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our chaika had fled, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Can she give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Because this is a question no one answered,&quot; says veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June of 1964, just one year after the flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father Andriyan Nikolayev was also an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice attended in orbit and even himself in space, was born son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But risks remain. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very little unit has astronauts which, after the long flight all cost, and grow up healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, that is dangerous even in the orbital flights,&quot; says a cosmonaut - hero, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia&apos;s Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet, humanity needs to be looking for a new path in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Neutral buoyancy laboratory CPC - compulsory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in terms of nbl astronauts jankunas skills in space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If adult water, albeit comfortable, but still a foreign environment, the baby is his element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small if confirmed - life on land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a correlation between what he is about 9 months with his mother in amniotic fluid fluid, it is easier to get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle this makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is just something to forget,&quot; says instructor of the mine at the Marina aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Words, if a child&apos;s birth weightlessness more natural, and for women - is gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, pelvis, its ability to push the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Significant, drop and this, relying on amphetaminetype generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It is, of course, in a special camera to go to childbirth, will push it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;Then what?&quot; - not a trivial matters Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, child needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> With no sense of gravity, the body is not a skeletal and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Newborn into orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special full costume for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He will simply be deprived of what he will be essential. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to that, we will bring in the land of the disabled, fully make human rights,&quot; foresee the Committee on Bioethics IMBP apatity ihor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> But, in time, it will be a reality, when Earthlings on the ship will go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the Audit Office: Schwarz - inspection system failed at the hands of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement the Czech Republic has a good monitoring bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> The statement of myroslav Kāla, vice - president of the Supreme Audit Office, to the site Aktuálně. Cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the&quot; said the current situation of Calais. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> This conclusion for the joint inspection Czech and German authorities of control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example the wrong practice leads approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called Schwarz - system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said the group (Civic Democratic Party) will not be worried by entrepreneurs check - out is prohibited or granted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be installed in any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are required to check and to meet the commitments,&quot; - Calais. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between Czech and German sides, in which was compared the legislation on public procurement both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> On parallel investigation, which we started, perhaps, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question is whether that European legislation say, how should be public procurement, followed by national legislation and then at practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> The information collected and, even if still unfinished test found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be &quot;Accurate and clear,&quot; but in practice we have some options than those in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> From this is that it is not enough to create a more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And around this project can help you, he does it mean to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means getting such things-to-low (but not always) price, to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will reach, reducing restrictions of orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps, this system will mug up &quot;Securities&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than it would have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the internal problems of application of the legislation on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as a functioning system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there such as our petersburga (Audit Office) or this work otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As regards the institutions, something in the quality of our play bundesrechnungshof, based on our principle, there is also a board, who works a little differently, but for the most part, both institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Moreover, powers similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a unit of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Brh can manage only federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities control at the federal level of counting houses. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> For the local legislation, there is easier than us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany could be used as a model, but it is safe to say that she is better in all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> So, because they are better at dealing with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> But definitely not, I repeat, a comparison does not like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I have to say, even an exemplary country faces many challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not see any benefit from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow be felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal validity of the amendments a short, she still had not shown in our work to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we hold control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take this into account only in the process of future inspections - we have started to use our new instrument &quot;The risk of detection,&quot; through which we ran nearly 14,000 state contracts. We looked at. There are, of course, these changes will also be shown, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem, which may be, is that the rules &quot;Will tighten&quot; and can not be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> During the previous rules-controlled enterprises deep with the provider (for example, the regional operational programme with the Regional Council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of the budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is in this case to tighten the law this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> System should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal errors, leaving the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s recognize that the road will not lead. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said the group will not disturb business checks so-called Schwarz - system. What does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwarz - system&quot; is prohibited or granted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be installed in any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then Prime Minister can not resist the work, which has to check and to meet the commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> We can say: &quot;We will change the law and allow it,&quot; but you can not say that I was going to pretend that nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement rather, as well as what is formally to be held, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best proposal disqualified because of the formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The road slippery places, but mostly. </seg>

<seg id="1135"> At every concert will be several bands and performers. </seg>

<seg id="1137"> We tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For instance, in Prague will perform chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere by Bartha, the tap tap marián Wu Bangguo and jiří Suchá. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Of all of the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz. </seg>

<seg id="1141"> In may will be the first to speak at the &quot;Prague Spring&quot; and then, of course, will make an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In the next year, we would love to have held view in the Czech National home in New York, and I personally, if we are going in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About the countries you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as scary as it seems. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five participants for electric wheelchairs, their child must travel in the cargo hold, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, dealt with this without problems of Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airlines and British Airways have always been great for us, that prepared me how much of a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, all passed without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> With trips abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you have seen to date? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all works better than us, in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In comparison to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise move independently of a man in an electric wheelchair into the centre of town. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also there in the course of such basic things, how to give way to the disabled in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there is a public institution, which is trying to draw people&apos;s attention on the problem of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the level of play is far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, may go to the toilet, a museum, but anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in that we have with the tap tap a little bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect of the public or neglect is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all and will begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as this one-time - people strong-willed. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap currently very popular, but will return to two years ago that in 1998, you made her to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the Institute of Jedliczka as a teacher, I had many young people who wanted something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And because I am a musician and play including at the saxophone, then he and a colleague has organized an interesting musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, as our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a little out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity came only in recent years, and I have confused? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we have helped that we have started to join the famous singers and work actively to the propaganda of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can estimate, in fact as if they do not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> By means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Were there before you order so well to get the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is a lot of things, Express one another. </seg>

<seg id="1175"> There is very little rare of things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first man&apos;s impression that we see, of course, sorry, that is... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is over, because people with disabilities are not suffering from any and all the personalities, which we must spare. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live a normal life and to develop, of course, only to the extent that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities that it is - then it is not for them, but to all of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Have success that you are a strict head, what you would think? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to make it work properly, we should be uncompromising on a lot of things and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I believe, that is all right. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic idea and in, and when he hears that twice a week, they should go to rehearsal, to attend the preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it is so in any group that want to work and to accomplish something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> In the group-the tap tap twenty. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> As it did in the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ladya Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member Esa September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began working closely with Esa in 1994 and in the years that followed, the active participation in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the way to space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have been doing to space, but it is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Recall, for instance, to lecture a. Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, of which December 6, 1933 were in Warsaw astronomical Observatory of the idea of his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to space.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience who, after several years of Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, recalled that only Dr. Kostka Gadomski ján was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Ary Abramovich Sternfeld in France in 1934 won the award of Robert Hesnault - Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsi for &quot;Introduction to space.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Kostka Gadomski ján (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great advocate of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in the Polish magazines of hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on the scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Kostka Gadomski became well-known proponent of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925, Poland was built railway an inspection, equipped with rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It was not even clear to crack down or to brake of the truck was meant to be used missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The draisine known only from newspapers of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> With 1933 Polish artillery began to worry about the missile missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Research carried out section of weapons technology in cooperation with professors mieczysław Volfka and Gustav Mokzhitskiy. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops of the work was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in specialized printing the idea of photovoltaic gbis fighter, which offered an engineer rogozin&apos;s atlantist, and next year the work &quot;Air missiles - torpedo and air missiles and bombs&quot; author Lelivy - Kzhivoblotskiy. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects have been developed for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects for military use missile technology was doing temporary scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, performance ended due to the outbreak of war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The scientific work, devoted to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (polskie towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the company is mentioned in november number 1954 Journal of &quot;Problem,&quot; in which provides four-dimensional article on Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one professor M. Subotovich offered to organize society, which will occupy the space. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, had already gathered pace projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956, the Society of Astronautics (Poá) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and the autumn Poá become a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And the following year the first chairman Poá of Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this role, he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> With 1956 Poá made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful sounding rocket rm (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, the latter scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type rm -1 were completed in 1957, and the first round was held on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Missiles able to overcome a distance of 1800 meters, was in length of 80 inches, and her weight was 5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Was subsequently built an improved version of rm -1 a, and in the summer of 1959 Bledovskiy compound was carried out on the two-stage rocket rm -2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was in length of 1.4 meters, and her weight of about 11.5 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the rocket was able to do this research - missile rm -34 to 14.5 km, and her job was overseeing the high-altitude wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962 further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Of the first missiles rm a rocket meteor -1, between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Missiles was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 inches, and initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Was developed type three (designated as a meteor -1 a, -1 B and -1 C), which was organised the size of the camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Missiles a -1 and had space for 0.4 L, a -1 - 0.34 L, and a -1 - 0.62 L. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Maximum range of all three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between the years 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute had the development of missiles a -2, and its first flight test began in October of 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Missiles a -2 from the weight of 380 kg was able to lift cargo weight of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then built a version of the -2 and a -3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, the programme Interkosmos, Poland took part in the research of space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot mirosław Hermaszewski became the second space after Vladimir Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abolition of the law on public works - is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision provoked lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Sure, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal - oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that separate economic unit, national economic system, is in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unfettered flow of private capital along with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (pay) price tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> The thing you need to understand the situation, when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods are trying to survive in the economic competition is what &quot;Is&quot; the cost of a competitor in order to get a larger share of the market and, therefore, to increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, this means for the majority of employers or shifting production abroad, or low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearance. The result is increased unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with other, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As private capital has no social responsibility, including for producing the inevitable unemployment, rising government spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The overall situation amplified by the reluctance of the gentlemen of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the social economic and social damage in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well-known that need no specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> At his methods of private capital will at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other, to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the government gives its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in the first place in the change of the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is cost to make his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This act as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serve as an instrument of cutting workers&apos; rights in the sphere of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a higher level of poverty, but also to the difference between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years there is public distribution of food to the poor who can not feed themselves own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are close to million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the efforts to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases, when employed people receive a salary that the state must say that they received subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> This scandal, was seen by the public and in case of additional employees of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all southern EU states, no doubt, leads to the same condition, in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social status, are required to emigrate, as it was in the 19 century, or to exist on poverty-level wages on the margins of society, in the hope that some day in the country is going to come from private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But the question is, where he will take them? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, an African still works for the European share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media were nausea that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital has insisted that the state has managing action to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The question to be answered is not whether private capital, is now practically management policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Clear answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is there almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have a hopeless situation, revealed in corruption, benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserve punishment, but is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Of the situation is that the State Department because of a lack of funds to the development of bills private law firms, which are closely linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills argue the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The power comes not from the people, according to the Constitution of the Western-style, but from financial - powerful groups who own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously, the liberal - oriented democracy now quickly find themselves in such a situation, as described Appianom in the works &quot;Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompéia&quot;: &quot; The state has long been broken up, and agencies are involved in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice ...&quot; Decent people do not run for governor, and, in the end, once the state for eight months without consul...&quot; &quot;Began to talk seriously about the fact that the only salvation in a terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of finding energetic man...&quot; Appian Pompéia thought it would be, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in antiquity, in modern society dominated by its own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital has already at its core is not intended to apply to public order. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any efforts to reform a more profound. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason why a fascist and Communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19 and 20 centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected to be the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First tragic is that the current elite has ignored consequences in the thousand victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not for good. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus this trend are systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Solution is to target political and social reforms, which will strengthen the shares of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and will weaken the monopoly of private capital in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Of violence will not do, and can never get out&quot; - sting, the song &quot;Fragile,&quot; where the main verse of the refrain is a word: &quot;Do not forget what we are really fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want war, there would be no&quot; - dying goutelle Shnaper, wife meer Amshel Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused many of the responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One advocate for Israel, arguing his position, that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians in the terrorists&apos; other supports the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the state of Israel, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to think about who in this periodic waves of murder victim is the criminal, and who, in the end, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including self-governing territory, was born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to take a look at who primarily a 95-year-old tensions (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November of 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning is based on historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity - is the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era we can find the same or Alexander the Great, Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people themselves take their own steps, or for their throne was someone who sent their actions to advance its goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and their power could not take place for a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among from astronomically wealthy families are allocated one, which could be regarded as the head of octopus (do not know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many of them do not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first News agency (reuters) they bought already in the 90 years of the 19 century, to stop rumors linking their behalf with criminal action in high places, in the shadow of who they were, and which has always led to a strengthening of their power, wealth creation or both, in the way of another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large blocks of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they do not have a stake, they have been or are preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was 7, after the invasion of Iraq has 5 members, after overthrowing Qaddafi stayed only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve Central Bank for Rotshildovskiy Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to print their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (federal Reserve), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after like Sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst of world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the establishment of the plan three world wars created great a 33-level Albert solderings. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The objective of the first war was the collapse of the monarchy in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially Britain, and the third will lead to a reduction of the world&apos;s population to about 0,5-1 people of (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not use), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than a precondition for such project) and the seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method by which a working group of the richest families headed rothchilds, in the face of the crisis and the supply of (ab Chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (cf. The Fed, which was intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis, resulting in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they have been able to start the first world war, by killing of the Habsburg heir of the Austro - Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, by Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended a sudden, unfounded in military and economic relations surrender of Germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia), and, as a result, there has been carving up Central European country, Austria - Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany&apos;s huge war reparations, than the conditions to radicalization of the impoverished masses, then went on to have the Germans strong, convicting perpetrators and offering simple solution of the leader, to create a multinational czeckoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and indeed played a 5th column, with the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> In the late 19 century, the Rothschild family has provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration set the stage for a massive immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen first encounter with local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to assess, escaped whether Hitler from chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps set the stage for a recognition of the Jewish state world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was caused by war reparations for the 2 world war, the state of Israel was declared, to create a hotbed of war third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will be able to start, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front line, now with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only nationally but internationally (to take only a sharp division of people on both supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers confronts the people to vote in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Yastreb Israel&apos;s current prime minister, Netanyahu is a typical example of Nazi, loyal international bankers policy, making all, to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and given control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of all of the world&apos;s oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the world are now being words, by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;What we need is a crisis, and people will accept the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in their vision is a world of gentlemen and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, coveted comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> The world body, where every child born with the implant chip, with whom he is being under total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot; And makes all large and small, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on the right hand or forehead on a stamp, so that the man, who has not been marked with the name of the Beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> There is the wisdom: everyone with reason, can calculate the number of the Beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> For consistent with it the name of human, and the number is six hundred sixty six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot;: when worse; there is Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November of 1979, a crowd of demonstrators Islamist students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the Revolution in the United States, which was the patron saint of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US administration the situation was not expected - she could not afford to throw shakh overboard, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the Revolution have led to the theocratic regime, she was not in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was strengthened by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Prisoners diplomats was finally released 444 days later, after the talks mediated by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate was summoned home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, repressed actor Ben Affleck &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot; Describes one of the episodes of the story, which brought America&apos;s small victory. </seg>

<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Plan, which invented an expert on &quot;Evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To legend was true, in specialized magazines are writing about a film project, was a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation for a long time was kept secret, film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called &quot;Movie - movie Opus,&quot; the story of a good idea, is an example of what could be a series of films about Ocean&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The film is constantly changing mood - documented on the one hand, of scenes from Tehran (the credits shown significant historical photographs of events, and the way the situation was demonstrated in the film - a big difference in this). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood mosimage, overlapping with irony and mild exaggeration. </seg>

<seg id="1452"> Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on their side, that we are successful. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to organize direct television broadcast, in which I refer to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>

<seg id="1464"> I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I at least supported leading investigative journalist ján Lorentsov fraud, which opened with a light fuel oil. </seg>

<seg id="1467"> sixty percent of the people do not bother to vote, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are an independent in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People chose the Senate so that changes will be made to work. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about it, because I do not have the time to check the cleanliness past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> No money and on the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only 20 thousand kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You do not have the money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Youspeaking financial disclosure, and how has your own business with it? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have done in Prague cost about 25 million in 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston - Martin on 3500 thousand, and Skoda Superb on million, and several million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston - Martin, I have, because it was my first dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, were Gallant, a charmer with women, and, at the same time, fought against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You travel to Aston - Martin, owns property in 60 million and you do not have money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change their own money, but particularly in this is to invest not want. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15-million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> The campaign I have already invested 2500 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Campaign costs me essentially will cover senatorial salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But this money I would not have survived, for example, would not be able to pay the son of an English, which is 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to make money, so they would not be running. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So, as you will be doing business, in order to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Do not you said that will reduce these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised her I partially diminished. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, managing director of travel agency in spring will be my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I was his, which will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to do something for a living. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> But, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive a monthly basis? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From two centuries before the thousand that are further. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became president, then their business over. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview will find in the Saturday edition of the newspaper &quot;Right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Architects mvrdv argue that this action is not only in the imagination - for example Spijkenisse and his nylig knizhnoe mountains - 2 Photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally, we again you can see something interesting,&quot; says Lisette Verkhayg, passers-by to the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermony, an expert on it at the nearby large enterprises, consider this: &quot;No, it is really beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we are still one shop? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All Internet, the iPad and electronic book. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> It is now accepted voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, outstanding a town near Rotterdam, is a unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80.000 is the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the education and to build seven fictional bridges, as evidenced by the euro notes, as richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of these educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the town fathers understood that they remained the only way to beat the statistics: to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame Maas of Rotterdam architectural mvrdv, master of bold bar charts and witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, toward the task with his usual calm and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jurors looked puzzled look back and shoulders, audacious Maas from its original gift Pyraminx in size and completed a speech in favor of the project following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my suggestion: &quot;The Mountain&quot; in Spijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> nine years of these mountains grew at a rate of 30 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a project of revitalization, which also includes underground garage, supermarkets, and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, &quot;The Mountain&quot; was marked by the second prize in the &quot;Best libraries of the Netherlands 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project involved in the Dutch national contest of wooden buildings 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, faceless suburb, all of which could not offer anything more than postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly ratusha, white facades which brings to mind the milk, has become richer for a modern works of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But just a first in the history of this town of Spijkenisse public buildings of cultural destination. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: knizhnoe geldoradog under the cap for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Here only one elevator, held in the centre of the, for the fans and the reading would prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Glass from all sides room is light and easily foreseeable, these bricks and elegant street lamps accurately creating a sense of public urban area. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Urban environment was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Eye on the bench, search dogs and playing football for boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually the bookshelves on the facades, and in the middle is located in a large, darkened, usually a comfortless and faceless,&quot; says you should blame the Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We put a classic configuration of space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Internal space knizhnoe mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, Internet Library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Particularly pleased black bookcases, which serves as the Wall, the, the stair railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their form, texture and smell is unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even experienced architects and engineers roadway, &apos; what is the unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We tried to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager of the community Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once at one agricultural enterprises in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of Agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in greenhouses and fields lining in the Netherlands as the roots are subject to an artificial fibres of a millimeter thick. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and save time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Fine textiles an one - two seasons, then it can be thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the Library of the painting - for the first time in this volume - was in the thickness of four inch. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> From the heat and pressure so-called (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, solid material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top are 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Those who will go almost 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in literary cafes not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and Wood Ficidae in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They are concerned about the atmosphere, and particularly on the right moisture in the air on literary grief. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> New soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, was a model project in terms of the environment,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For heating and cooling is used by the warmth of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountains are under the cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> a farm of laminated timber, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and accept most of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Air quality is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of protection provides fully automatic roll curtains. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stephane of Spermony, cited above skeptic of hi-tech, has already visited New Library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verkhayg also have been here before. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as acting coach of traditional Chinese medicine cynthiya Bogarde, who called Bukenberg &quot;Soul Spijkenisse, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: a few weeks before the opening each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from its own collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This book was to take place on an empty shelves are not yet fully featured Library - at the time it was the 70.000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves full of ground up. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than half-empty library,&quot; says architect blame Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot; I think that, thanks to our invitation now each resident in some way connected with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, mvrdv managed to cope with the Royal task, which in a professional jargon is called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And they are very young and too uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for the construction of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained from the vote on recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: in the week the German first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin have abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany have to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I think that the American position, it also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained on the no-fly zones. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO held the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to have a clear position on the complex international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The matter is, it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely pass from politicians, so to speak, by the us, of the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have agreed a common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans again is between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, they are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that the only fumble, but are on the path to &quot;More normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly is &quot;Normal&quot; foreign policy with a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to play in national position, not dependent on the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The economic interests of Germany are very different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Did this economic interests in position in the Middle East conflict and to vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Harmed if Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when important decisions, such as voting on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States&apos; understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I do not think it was the same dramatic trauma, as in Libya&apos;s question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germaniyadazh will acquire thus a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that with its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, had made it clear veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Are differences of opinion between the United States and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In American domestic politics of these differences was always there. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration in the back, has a sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly to take that position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that serious differences of opinion is not as significant as it always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will see that Obama is not happy about the policy of the Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and an important partner in the EU and other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes this very difficult situation for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can not do this as part of a broader approach and is forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> They do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that, in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that for Germany, this is difficult, if only because of their links with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as a major international player - will not take if it is really the main role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or leading role remains an uphill battle Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany are not used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, is still always gives a significant role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany take on an important role is different donavan feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans are not just to deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view of Germany is in much worse shape than the us. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take account of the different neighbors and opinion, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, us influence in European politics permanently weaken, but at the moment the EU do not fill this vacuum, then remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like, unpleasant, or increasing enmity to you - that is life! </seg>

<seg id="1632"> Armani - world-famous brands, Polo Ralph Lauren - too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But that Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is officially registered in China&apos;s name, which has nothing to do with the firms, from names which it was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the names will not file suit. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then it is not clear, and whether they will defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattlokh, a lawyer for the company, Taylor Wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On the table every week appear on a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators to add a couple of letters to achieve the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci to receive Lu-instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied by a German company, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattlokh open the folder with records for the registration of trademarks in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> September 14, 2010 Chinese companies have registered trademark there zegna samsen Puma, artificial name, in which used the name fashion houses Ermenegildo zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are champions of the world and the violation of intellectual property rights, known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> There are large department stores, which sells almost exclusively a fake. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But matters Pattlokh not like... On behalf of its clients he was opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the registration of a trademark right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;Ban Pollock,&quot; Mark - passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with &quot;Ban of nowhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> Called the women, who are hunting for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize a wine </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It hurt business, must be reduced,&quot; says Pattlokh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Brands have been diluted, a unique position is image suffered tremendously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries million, especially in the case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company by market research firm clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year, the third-largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But to achieve removal of the controversial in of the trademarks is difficult, and it it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattlokh talks about cases in which the court rejected claims, because after long opposed the name was a &quot;Reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the claimant is lucky, he will have to pay a plagiarist, as damaged his trademark in China, says Pattlokh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There are also in the case of graphics. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction vehicles Sany, the company, which acquired shortly before the manufacturer of transportations by concrete pumps putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> So they still have the right to use the emblem, like a star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Bought Volvo by Geely use a Blue - and-white logo, like the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of fashion in China at the shirts from Hong Kong and Singapore, which famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010, because of staff shortages and outfitting there have been problems. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year was &quot;Returning from emergency situation in the workplace to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> , the number of cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To fight this expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year in CTMO had received more than 1400 thousand applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record, and means that China for 10th consecutive years, led the list of new registrations in the world, according to agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same is true of the total number of valid trademarks, all 5500 thousand of them. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it paid 1800 million yuan of fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> To simplify, this means that each there are on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To contest it is many times that, as a matter of fact, the German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the fight against Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal manufacture them fake auto parts were. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But copycat has cemented its right to Chinese trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own fault, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, said Hanno of Venttslery, chairman of the board Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks CTMO rejected claims of. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both the authorities Freudenberg won, but the different factions continue their struggle until now. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We need to be vigilant </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The issue is considered by the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttslery hopes to bring the case to a good outcome and praising the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;The extremely expensive and takes our time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs it is difficult to track, the archive of the firm had to see even acts one hundred years ago, to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> five years ago Freudenberg in vain suggested that the other side &quot;Big-digit amount in euro&quot; for the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This makes it clear how much that we are,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The danger of the Far East threatens to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> In the case, if at the register in the unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The long ago ceased production in these areas, but it is been able to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We need to be vigilant,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on the international situation on the protection of trademarks, most likely aliens were &quot;All that any way is to protect, to register in China,&quot; says Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it might be more costly than registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed: if Freudenberg will lose in the last act of his drama about trademark, the other side will be asked to pay licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttslery. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we would go out in controversial segment. </seg>

<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the procedure is based on &quot;The principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that means &quot;Principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and the fear that Islamists will use vague formulations arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least on this suggest a new article: in all cases where Sharia, should be used to board the University of al - Achard, the main Islamic institution of the country, with great authority across the Sunni Islam. </seg>

<seg id="1993"> And now the word of &quot;Human rights&quot; did not meet the new Constitution, sorry he is in an interview with the &quot;Welt am sonntag.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi&apos;s expanding influence on all three branches of state is just a lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures represent a clear attack on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Rather than to strengthen civil state, President de facto annulled his&quot; - sorry Syed. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Without civil society organizations democracy can not function. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind the country&apos;s residents about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexicans of American origin is torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico I walked down the corridor for arriving, approached the area of border controls, and remained in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> Few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California, and my whole life called Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is just a name, just as my friends in Boston to call himself Irish, and friends from New York see themselves as Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped on the &quot;American of Mexican origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Is here, in my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complicated structures. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answers. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of language, and I can not get rid of an American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I took his American passport and was in line for an extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when President-elect of Mexico&apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Was the issue of the day for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drug trafficking and human trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The President of Peña Nieto to speak about the rise of the Mexican economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of being moved to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Moreover, President of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were not there. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The majority of Americans have not really thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the point of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and a reminder of the events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is only any statesman to utter a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society they had heard complaints about what Americans would infringe on the sovereignty of the neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And descendants of montezuma are filled with militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex is Mexico&apos;s relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Obid want to talk about? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Them enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country the right, and those for whom such opportunities are not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - had not been able to achieve in Mexico and was forced to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> This was the Mexicans of a particular type - dark, education, poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We their descendants, and we remember this. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we are taught in high schools and a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination is confusing and it is not clear, but we know what countries consider their own. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Yet we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We meet them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens as a fake Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not speaking Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them is due to failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not be where we are right now for silk curtain, finding in the United States a pampered life, but lost a spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the United States legally as a child, and it reminds me that between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Mexican Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belong to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Tigres Del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> By the best of two worlds, you will inevitably lose their roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In the US call us Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations already are not confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and was its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would be able to tell their friends - Americans, which is a beautiful country and how well her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> There, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Will not do. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> Given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think these countries such a beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am sorry, but I can identify themselves, location. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And rightly so. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the majority of Mexicans still can not forgive the United States how they interact with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept, and the fact that some Mexican Americans still in pain for the way most recently in Mexico is that their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battle of the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundations for further peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The prospects for a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> It sounds, the disputes, senseless, about who first began; many of the buildings are in ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the Gaza Strip of the rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel&apos;s Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his old conflict in the Middle East, came change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be interpreted in many ways, events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; swing round in the storm a number of well-established reality, and the Palestinians and Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, rocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more violent than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there is reason to give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be kept, which occurred this week of clashes only strengthened the hand of law enforcement agencies on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say, that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite incurred losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed and 1.7 residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled part of our planet, they are not able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas build its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory, currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that the time work for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas is a powerful and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which once was the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, expressed support Hamas; have followed Qatar, one of the richest and developing countries of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Triumphant supporters of Hamas claims about creating around Israel of Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the North, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which Islamist insurgents are about to topple the government of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the rule of King threatens allies of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change the balance of power in the region have occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi has influence of the movement the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, does not have special attention to support Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are a lot like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic constellations Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to turn even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;Hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In the military sense, Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israeli missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; meet the costs of production and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Citizens of Israel can sleep well, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its long-standing position; many European countries also blamed the latest round of violence in the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed by missiles fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through walls, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protect Jewish settlements, which continues to grow despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the January 22 elections - teamed up with even more bellicose conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, a very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What makes sense to encourage the Palestinians and to give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If brought to their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, will not start if they can run from there rockets at Israel as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempt to head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It is possible, supporters &quot;Hard&quot; line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> With the Islamists, who comes to power in Egypt and other countries, have not the warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be domestic issues. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Defense part of the budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatism of Egypt&apos;s President Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of a change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not least, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the advent of democratic change in Arab countries, the hardships of the Palestinians&apos; right to self-determination is a time bomb that, sooner or later, will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression has already is shaking the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, but demograficheskii - growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The deadly operation, which is held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas movement, has to pay its growing influence of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need outside impuls </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It is the only solution, which tirelessly encourages sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two-state solution and the assignment of territories in exchange for Israel&apos;s security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, not too impressive in the short - term, hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence on the side of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which were long overdue decision to cut off the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar has, as ever, advantageous position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries also need to work towards reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming UN vote, which could be a recognition of the virtual state of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Its role in order to bring Israel to the negotiating table, to play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he did not own the peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to the solution of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is disastrously shortsighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia became the law to create a unified and packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warning about the dangers of smoking and disease in the affected parts of the body in contrast to be devoted to dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world to Australian law on a package of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different-the same box is glum - olive color with a picture of the affected parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been smoking of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Pomimoraznyy pictures and captions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed on with this Saturday - name brands, which published the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe in the world of conditions for packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia said that the goal is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis of such a decision were the results of research showing that people, not started to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 will never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Obviously, the very young age children make sense, which is trying to bring the tobacco company with the help of the packaging,&quot; as minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, citing research showing that, for example, the Crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes do not affect the profit transnational corporations, the impossibility of those measures are already considering and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the proportion of black market, which will be sold cheap cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences, other than those who thought the initiators&quot; - Scott MacIntyre, a spokesman for the British American tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will provide much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, by contrast, the new laws have contributed to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandré from a small family company Ḫāʾ Zico import Pty Ltd said that demand for cigarette and silicone covers, hiding unpleasant picture on the packaging, rocketed (almost from scratch) since the two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco lost a case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to protest the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra Ḫāʾ Zico, the company has already implemented some 6 thousand products enterprises of wholesale trade and expect the New Party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures are, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among this is the part of the population, which sent the measure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> In Australia after the adoption of a number of laws illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support of their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to make cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit in the foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you sell tobacco products and you have only small idea to promote their wares on the Internet will show you a very attractive,&quot; says Becki Freeman, an issue of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman increasing number of reviews of trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether this was the work of an ordinary citizen, which is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare time and energy and made a video, or behind this advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian unit of British American tobacco has said the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules, the advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the new rules: the state made no claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying the trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries&apos; trade with Australia was very limited. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to their similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada&apos;s first introduced mandatory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> In the rules adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening of laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Number of smokers in Australia has not obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The picture I did not touch them. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just do not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Merely draws a cigarette and hide it in your pocket&quot; said Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes with photographs of the cancer of the mouth of the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me to give up my baby daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James training, the manager of the store of tobacco products King of the pack in the centre of Sydney, has said the same packaging has complicated the task of the distribution of goods on shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I have the unloading of the New Party took a hour, and now four hours&quot; - he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to take and, to ban cigarettes, we would have said: what to do, well, it is over, closed shop,&quot; he says, hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our plane was found mechanical problems and his other plane, which is what we were for. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to kid. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Noon at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either book, or magazines, or iphone, nor even the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But in recent years scientists and experts in child development is in favour of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that, in certain situations, for us and for our children to get bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to be distracted by an interesting related topic, which probably contributes to creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As in the modern world we are all constantly any screen, the advantages of boredom pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to strive for boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to this point. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many others, believed that boredom - invention relatively recent times, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Not so, says Peter Twohy, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;Fascinating history of boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom has a very ancient history,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscription of boredom, dating back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> The open question is, how we perceive the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The studies on the subject, and asking the task force in 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to this definition: boredom is when people &quot;Want, but you can not do what they would meet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people do not do something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy to do anything I do not want. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The boredom in the present, he said, is &quot;a violation of the attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time, are slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> As boredom may seem very similar to the Depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we would be hard for something to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;One reason: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention,&quot; published in last month&apos;s issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, participants listening to a recording of his voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> The participants were also loud sounds not related to the case of the programs are included in the next room, others have heard the same sounds on low volume, so their, you could barely make out, and a third group only listened to the recording of his voice without any sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The participants, who heard the low level of volume, noted that they were bored, more than others found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. Fensk, an associate professor of Neurology at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something this, &quot;For example, studying in the flow of merchandise on line in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is, he says, that when people start riding on a chair to portray picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but we now know that the number of such actions only help you to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research has shown that children who are not prohibited to fidget and to turn, learn and remember more information than infants who want to sit down,&quot; said Professor Fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some points we are all bored: when the flight (as in my case), listen to a monotonous speech, watching this film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people demonstrate or less prone to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s to measure of such individual features researchers have developed a &quot;The scale of the propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> For the definition of the scales are using questions and approval, for example, &quot;Much of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved&quot; or &quot;Me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of these questionnaires the researchers found that boys skuchaem more girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But teenagers generally often bored. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, in which he was linked with the help of pager with as many as 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32% said that they get bored in school and at the time of his homework, and 23% said that they get bored out of school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents said that they get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that, &quot;The teenage peak prone to boredom,&quot; largely because children and teenagers do not allow in position to decide what they will do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my initial question: boredom useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme, studies show that it can drive people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, says professor Vodanovich, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us that we need to do something different, and this is the boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what better way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are going to be bored and you will find the energy to play the guitar or culinary experiments, you will make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you get a TV, you will be better for only some time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Therefore, if your child missing and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not be able to contend with boredom or as in other ways to manage their time and employment, says professor Fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And the skills of self-regulation is in many situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child can learn not only entitled to occupy themselves something, he is also studying the self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that boredom need some way to praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But to be a bad thing, however, is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather should learn how to feel comfortable even without the constant stream of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agree. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see that, we need more likely to experience boredom, and boredom is extremely unpleasant, an insatiable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people are trying to show off the persistent worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world, we are used to the constant over-stimulation of the sensory organs, he says, and when silence, we are lost and do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is unclear how will be subject to a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozko, a nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado charged with a criminal offence, which holds that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco had subpoenas for possession of drugs and devices for possession of drug use - a minor offence for each of which is due to a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;With us were treated as criminals,&quot; says Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But criminal is he? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of uncertainty, which has lasted several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of thousands of small lawsuit does not depend so much on the law, but from the place of consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Charged with crimes related to marijuana, has already been filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has adopted similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped condemned people age 21 and older for possession of small doses, what will happen to be lawful, as only a couple of weeks it will come into effect. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But in the more conservative counties in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the cases related to marijuana, and still held liable for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> In some cities to the suburbs of Denver to mountainous areas of the West&apos;s vote that can be avoided in their places new licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect further,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora east from Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled by scratches his head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are to be established rules for defining the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it should be done before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, for good or evil, ahead of most of the other states in the regulation of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example&quot; said Brian J. Smith, a representative of the Council on the regulation of production and marketing in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, says Mr Smith, than to put forward any proposal and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, in which we could focus,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Bill of Washington, called the I -502, will come into force on December 6 and on the whole year will put the state in a state of limbo, when the state licensing yet, and possession of marijuana has been legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But there is still a difficult technical aspects, which need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the disposal of the state of &quot;Adequate access&quot; to licensed marijuana from a ban on trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It is especially difficult it will be to place a licensed Enterprise for trade in marijuana in a line of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; as Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently released study &quot;The centre of the legalization of marijuana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21 the police chief Oates from aurors sent his subordinates by e-mail message that the prosecutor&apos;s office of the town will no longer have to involve people from age 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops are caught people in these violations &quot;From this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the operation in the town of those crops such as marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and distributors of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Prosecutor Weld County in Northern Colorado, Ken Buck, a more rigorous approach to the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill he said that his office will continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage was using it to pass a course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> The 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, though many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The responsibility of our institutions - to pursue the action, which is considered a crime at the time of their commission,&quot; said Mr. Buck in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reaction was controversial even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Junction, the largest town in the District, no longer held liable quite-year-old for possession of small amounts of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take the allegations are already open cases connected with possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as he does not change our direct responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, who took part in the vote, upheld the decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions of people in different places of state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment of state with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The district attorneys in this matter is cultural barrier&quot; said Sean MacAlister, Denver lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They are people for so long for this, that it can not really to come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington, the first us, in which a small amount of marijuana are similarly to alcohol - is destined to become a pilot flying across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Supporters of legalization and officials of the state plans to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they are apprehensive waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Supporters of legalization of marijuana is hoping that the Justice Department had come to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases to agree on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents by the anti-drug is unlikely to break into the home, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the regulated state stores of recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, said Kevin a. Sabet, a former adviser on the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some town in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the presidential elections of some local administration approved moratorium on the opening of new stores for sale of marijuana, which could not open up sooner than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in a position that we will give somebody a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our town voted against the amendments. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and the vote, by what the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There remain many unresolved issues. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella of Uayetty: I survived from Oxford for being conservative. </seg>

<seg id="2409"> My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best in the world, educational institutions, the modern equivalent of ancient symposium, are the two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> And yet, two weeks later, his studies at the Department of Worcestershire College, University of Oxford in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life. </seg>

<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran away, because I have been hounded and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my unusual name, or that I attended a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this famous cradle of the light it was this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Uayetty, was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You ask, why not to think about it now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> According to the latest data, the new generation of students, with center-right views are subjected to the same bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The institutionalized and growing hatred of students - conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that accorded to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>

<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the week, when the freshman students work with each other and with professors, the first time I felt that was waiting for me to come. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I did not know that teachers not only did the harassment of students - conservatives, but gladly participated. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues - the miners&apos; strike, privatization and disagreement of governments to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa have slipped through the plywood wooden panels walls of classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In my first seminar I had to translate the French text 18th-century English, and I was not prepared for what followed it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Uayetty, said teacher, the late Harry Pitt, &apos; please, move your first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The article gave me hard, I hemmed. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was very Tylopilus man with a face like cake. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Tetcheristy are not learning French or just did not have enough brains?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Maniacally: other students. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> On my eyes were filled with tears. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his free time, if you do not, of course, very busy, rotating in society&quot; - Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room is unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> The night in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, second-year student of the Department of English, which is presented as a member of the Association of Conservative University. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot; I know who you are friendly, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> - Unfortunately, things are as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> On everybody who is suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives, will be funny. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> I am very easy, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because it will be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the freshmen - conservatives pretend that they are Labour .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at a local pub, I timidly tried to play. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that do not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> Trick failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> First-year student of philosophy, politics and economy, which he studied at Eton, said: &quot; You are the daughter of fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contagious .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students picked up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was damaged, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot; As conservatives have sex? &apos; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> - They beat each other, right? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> , I suddenly felt like I must have felt to criminal prosecution of homosexuals in the Sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Will I ever to live normal lives in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or I will have to meet like-minded only under the cover of night? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Will I have to be a Labour and to conceal their true beliefs? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The year three was to be hell, full of persecution and loneliness. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher in my college, of his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Hated him not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser on foreign policy, Thatcher and one of her speechwriter. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In college, he has appeared. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised him for the provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist - determinist view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you will not be happy,&quot; said he. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I wanted to go to Oxford from parental home in London, seeking refuge with relatives and unbiased torrevieja friends. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father I hate Oxford and explained the reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He did not believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his school in the forties there were any political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot; But it is the best universities in the world, said he is dismal. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> - Out there on this fails, not in the town of dormant spires... </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends - communists have always behaved impeccably .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His wet eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot; Do not take any hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is just a joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You will get heart, if you throw University. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was exhausted regular trips to London and my emotional protection faded. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, the conservative, could not handle the pressure and abandoned their beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> Next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history is seriously called me &quot;Enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In my soul screamer from shame, I was brainwashed &quot;I have parents,&quot; and called them &quot;Old fools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to kill my father. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time each week he wrote two columns for newspapers, owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I am not a member, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they are gone, I packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Can call me cry-baby and rags. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation to school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen prime ministers, the Tories, but is still behind undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The most difficult profession in the world: the miners from Kawah - Idzhena </seg>
<seg id="2557"> To four Indonesian miners risking life and limb, 70 pounds of sulfur on top of the volcano the steep, rocky trails </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work - hell, and others literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them Anthot Widjaja, one of the 400 miners who make a living from the extraction of sulfur in the volcano Kawah - Idzheny, located on the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day Anthot going down to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, freezes on the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Otkolov huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo basket, will place a basket on his shoulders and carry them out on a steep, rocky road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> To the top of the volcano, at a height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted men more than 40 minutes to climb a snail&apos;s pace, with Labour holding the balance and careful road, so as not to fail and not to fall off a cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one tourist, France, which fell off a few years ago from rocks Kawah - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners from Kawah Idzhena 5 - Euro cents per kilogram of sulfur, which produces </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Being at the top, they make his way between them tourists, who photographed, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy basket, walking three kilometers to balance mining company, which was slightly higher, at a height of 1.850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about paragraph of Kandy Ngrimbi, the company, which operates with 1960, the volcano, and it is best not to say, their employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 Euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83 Euro cents) petrochemical plants, because this mineral common in everyday life and used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As the transport 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each,&quot; as we Anthot, usually three doubles. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours on each of them and, in the end feels broken, but enable him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Though it seems to be little for such superhuman efforts, it is triple what he would have earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Journeymen diecimila miners very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (167 euros) ,&quot; says truckers, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and plot was not so heavy, but Anthot Banyuvangi returned with his family in a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: &quot;I married the girl from Bali, a Hindu, and brought her to the Java, she had converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Anthot asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he eye redness began to weep because of toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> 27-year-old Anthot spent three years, risking an in Kawah - Idzhena, sulfur, which has already begun to affect it in spite of the mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he eye redness began to weep because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> That is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Will work for another two years, because they want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French&quot; promises, he is more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, but instead he carry out the work of the mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing dirty wooden huts with other porters, he gets up every day in two hours of the night, because sulfur did not stop to emerge at night, when her distinctive yellow turns into the Blue and shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging the shadows, Anthot goes down to the crater, illuminating his way with a flashlight, connected to his helmet, which he bought for their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters drag from Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, mining company not mechanized production of sulfur for cost savings and it does not provide any equipment porters, who works at his own expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they did not even receive part of 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the Zapovednik charged with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people - mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for cattle, and not for people,&quot; said Badrusin, stocky and the Porter, who spent 42 years on Kawah - Idzhena three decades, since left the College. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept work &quot;As much as we can,&quot; because he needs the money for education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulfur is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly change and catch miners in a thick plumes of smoke from the volcano, they are so Hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... More serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, e.g., pain in his knees and on the shoulders, which is most under the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing baskets on his back, Unaynik now only can lift 50 kg in 53. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which carries three in stock in a truck Tamansari, facing a distance of 18 kilometers on the narrow path in the bush. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; says Unaynik, widely opening his mouth, in which do not have a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works for the carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult of the world: is dealing with human mules from Kawah - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looking for children to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans accuses career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needed to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I husband Patriot, you were my wife, follow our civic duty and will create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> May seem incredible that this line is part of the advertising of mints then, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - it became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> This phrase is part of the rap, which uses local saying such as &quot;Let&apos;s put Bao (roll) at the stove&quot; to laugh at birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising agency, which made the video, bbh, hope that, with the help of advertisements they will be able to draw attention to the problem in entertainment form. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music, so that people had made &quot;Its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> These things exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is a major problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of humans, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government was trying to do, for example to be launched spirits with pheromones or Party of rapid dating (blitz - visits). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas, perhaps, was creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why do not we make the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely to compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who do not take it so lightly, it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $ 1.300 a year on policies for inspiring the citizens of having more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> State package for couples and parents provide up to $ 15.000 per child, prolonged pregnancy and maternity leave and provide tax relief. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But it has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is rich and high-tech state - town in South - East Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his public scrutiny. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the National Directorate of the population, are currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> It was last below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Singaporeans so why not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of the office&apos;s policy of couples and families of the National Authority for the population, says that this is &quot;an Education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed people to have a broader range of options when it comes to life&apos;s goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and the family,&quot; explains it. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms and the growth in the number of bachelor and postponing marriage and the birth of a child, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decline in the population, an outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, which is barely disguised xenophobia in many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticized for keeping salaries, and reluctance to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the last year, Singapore&apos;s ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the birth rate has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, expenses for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to not have been built so many small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development proceeded to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;Shoe box,&quot; which you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The apartment of 46 square metres very well be sold. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, believe that they can contribute to a single way of life and deprives the incentive of developers who want to build a large family home. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, director of the House-building firm the developers, said that the &quot;Shoe box&quot; is selling faster than larger copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that the apartment is sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartment of a larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flow increases. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules give a clearer guidelines for developers, which had previously been obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too overextended </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is the city - state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing national birth rate, after talking with Singaporeans, who works in the financial quarter of the centre, it seems, that they will have little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very overstretched, expensive, as well as housing and education, and because of that many people are put off,&quot; says young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it was important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons, which makes it hard for them to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as the Government has tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, as regards to childbirth, the last word to the Singaporeans. </seg>

<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Maryelos Porras, our teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that to keep the children and teenagers, need to understand that the purpose of the social networks to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she notes. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicate that was Mark Prenski, master of education at Yale University and author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented the terms for an explanation of this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives they, children and young people, who was born in an era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we still learn,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this issue is complex, &quot;Because we are asked to have a certain criteria for what can or can not be extended, to the public or to speak, at an age when it is not enough for this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also to be selective, while the more important for them to be popular, to have thousand friends, not thinking about the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and adolescents, is to ask questions, which makes them to think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them that they did not do this, it is useless&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you are not a stranger to anyway, so why do you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have been happy if published photographs you like the one that has published you about a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what other published about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign a photograph with parties, ask whether you are letting other people, to commemorate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another, everyone needs to know, what are you doing in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they have to behave online, the same way they are offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Beyond the Internet rights deal with respect, responsibility and other principles, should also be on social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>

<seg id="2746"> Those who lecture, never undertake no obligation, and we in the South Americans, by contrast, signed by all. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum in Ecuador, the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that does not regret his decision, because he betrayed its principles, and comply with its &quot;Deep values of democracy and human rights.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2754"> &quot;This affects the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange, with June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the talks in London in search of a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We are not talking about human rights, the word in this case we do not use it, but there was a constant debate. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;I think the solution is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the judiciary, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, is a series of processes in various European institutions&quot; - mentioned it. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And said that &quot;If Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will be over.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if I lose the election in February of 2013, then from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal note, I have never been interested in power, but in this unjust situations, as in Ecuador, socio - economic poverty can be remedied only on the part of political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement considered, I am guaranteed the likely victory, so we have to admit that responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If this would be my last term in office of the President, and then we move out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If you lose, the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This decision,&quot; confirmed it. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> AIDS mortality today - a late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS led to a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I like he&quot; - he recalls the difficult, despite all the time of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Determined to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to know more about it as much as possible. And his effort was - he mentioned his 43 birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio - one of the &quot;Oldest&quot; patients HIV - branch of the hospital, hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He live with the diagnosis &quot;Of the human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (HIV) is 22. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too little then there was the treatment options, too little known about the disease, too have treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> So the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;Because he had cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, at the time, to have AIDS was sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now possible to survive the syndrome and to do so, not to the detriment of quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, many people are still coming, when the virus has already damaged, &quot;Depleted&quot; their immune systems and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged, &quot;Great achievement for the moment, however, is that the survival of patients, who start treatment on time, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same,&quot; Bulgaria&apos;s head HIV - secession hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that the information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, life expectancy and quality of life depends on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available to patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and 50, when it reports on 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that those who receive a diagnosis of HIV - positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, &quot;Maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess the progress, we should remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today with an average age of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report, Unaids), it is equally true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has recorded 187 deaths to may this year; however, that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why there are still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - It seems to me that the problem was not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> The way I think, so it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years there has been no lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because of his positive status, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led a devastating this: &quot;nine out of ten patients come in when you have some opportunistic infection; what to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make assessments at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all people, which it will ask.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal has the same opinion experts and officials of the state Council on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who went to check in a private laboratory, motivated by nothing but his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of Aids and even had Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the more common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some will die, and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Time will still die, I will be nadiraeshsya three times a week,&quot; they say. - but not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I do eat, exercise, taking drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of class, I travel, an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of yourself and of another man,&quot; a - listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with milenio Jalisco, to encourage his statement those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, with fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let him test, if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible know whether they are HIV - positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other man, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Big gap between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, I think Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara that have HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Andlargest this Prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places that are devoted to the task, &quot;Actually increased distribution of condoms, before we were one or two, now gives us packages for hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why are you?&quot; it is a popular question, with and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teens, assured propagandist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Proposes to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for me and to hundreds of thousands of them were in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not promoting promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not a question of the beer and motel, said the governor Emilio González, when asked if the distribution of condoms in his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It is not sexual, it is best to make condoms available for those who already have sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Total registered 13.435 cases of HIV-AIDS, and 1.317 (12.158). </seg>

<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is wrong, making this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia items collected for his long way, evidence of that. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The emotions he kept those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid 50s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance in the single - mandate an agent or an agent of the contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot; It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight the Cowboys from 1967, as the agent - agent or manager. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> It was many years of joy, including five world Championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome&apos;s in the Internet. </seg>

<seg id="2885"> I remember that said if the debt brought the Championship Bayamona, Gauss would have helped to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Having the Cowboys with Gauss I am, but at a distance, because the 1988 were part of the head of the Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I just want to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments supposedly in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember when we won the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 world Championships, where we got the fourth place and this was going to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us to beat the final game, said Reyes. </seg>

<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as those that won the dream team in the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite were the ones that, with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to the one we won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> To the team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico of Lopez and &quot;Pikulina of&quot; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &quot;Tonito&quot; and James Carter, Brothers Leone (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quixote of&quot; Morales, who is unable to attend in 90 because of a knee injury. </seg>

<seg id="2906"> Part in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s the Internet had to 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to do, for example, the regionalisation of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that the boy Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now guys go and play too much, and it is unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course management, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I listen to music, watch music videos my era on Youtube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball. </seg>
