<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to block the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the Brennan Center this last considered a myth and said that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from a lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, Republican lawyers not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American States are responsible for the Organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in that same line a majority of American Governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that hindered the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, during the year 2011 introduced 180 bills that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the other hand, these laws reduce periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter in the day of the poll, and removed his right to vote to citizens with a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo identification document. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana State was the first to demand it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For this reason, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years the authorities have supported bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo identification document. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a document of universal identity, such as the Social Security card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people age to vote, lack any document of photo identification issued by a governmental agency of the State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack proof of identity with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, the obtaining of the required identity document costs over a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Thus, the new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In effect, 25% African-American, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo identification document. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there is still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In many States students, more voters vote for the Democratic candidates, cannot use the document of identity with photograph issued by your institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that tend to vote Republican parties to use documents issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no State requires proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first State to introduce this requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures seeking, clearly, limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It seems that two of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolishing the voter registration the day of the ballot in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of assistance to voters who would like to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009 achieved new voter registration rate to fall in 2010 compared with the year 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other States that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of the electors of the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of Hispanics it happened exactly the same. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These do not represent more than 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Course, Democrats legislators and their supporters have opposed strongly the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this regard, Democratic Governors have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The tax Ministry of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It could, in part, limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo identification document. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that adopted new rules complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that with them is intended to influence the results of 2012 in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center&apos;s 2011 shows that States which have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to achieve the Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty if these legislative amendments to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of prostate cancer: take the test or not let them? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test presents, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides to carry out unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is more than reason enough to doubt the men, already reluctant of by Yes, about whether they should be or not detection tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked for advice to two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of infection among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been made the detection and which not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, with a follow-up at age 12, also showed that there is between 30% and 40% of chance of metastasis if not done the test for the detection. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend, therefore, test beginning at age 50, or from age 40 if your father had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men have a higher risk index. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You must provide all the possible options and not necessarily treat the prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case should opt rather for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today many men who has cancer been detected are not addressed, since the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to his life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if this progresses, offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more frequently we determine precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend to test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine if you must take the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in collaboration with the international society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document can be downloaded (for now only in English, but there will be translations soon) at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits are still the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one smoking, that rate will raise, at least 50 %&quot;, underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, we evaluated that about 10% of cancers are hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others are still totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It greatly harms the health of persons. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;There is today, still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; stated the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Fatness and obesity also favour the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, of esophagus, of pancreas and cancer of uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Investigations show that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; they added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The power </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Agency also recommended limit consumption of red meats. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, they escalate the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Charcuterie products should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salted may cause the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer&quot;, we explain. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, by the time his research is inconclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Segú the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, was observed in another that was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in cancer nor has been able to be clearly. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about concerns and family history of each with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Do the detection test does not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> Announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a major upheaval last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, it&apos;s the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which still has not been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists aren&apos;t completely clear is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that is very similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, but still need more data to be completely secure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyway, we suppose that it is Higgs, since the possibilities of mistakes seem few. We will see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this big world, there is a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way of breaking this rule and not try too much, because you will end up doing damage. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although the particle physics is a very complex world, has shown that there is a law of this nature also in it: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;State&quot; comprising, roughly, of some of its features. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists fall particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And on the other they are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or however not by this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the inns, which we will not discuss here, and &quot;force&quot;, particles that propagate the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson be somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, stress here, are not the exotic critters that we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you read this Chronicle, is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or &quot;light particle&quot; that acts as a &quot;Messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes of address, &quot;you mess&quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; kinda like when we launched a stone into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;disorder&quot; was born, an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing else than a photon; in other words, one of bosons &quot;carriers of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> Same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs, which needs to be &quot;messy&quot; to bring this boson. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach energies extremely high, a little as if it were a pond ice cream in which only a coarse rock could slide across the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Why need a huge particle accelerator as the CERN (the large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do so, but others did not: a piece of paper, for example, not will remain ever by itself attached to a refrigerator door. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, do &quot;can contribute&quot; all those research?, asks the Madam Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and it allows, in addition, that the physical escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of the Ms. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, many want fervently that they are, because the smallest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that cover certain holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This must be said, has still huge gaps, as it does not propose any explanation concerning the gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up around 80% of the matter in the universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of such research on our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we mistake by saying that it will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> So: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser laboratories not suspected at all the revolution that would lead to his work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw the scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, as already the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where they invented the laser in 1960, and he drafted the first continuous laser (the first were struck) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a &quot;laboratory equipment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a sensor light in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> While it was not at all his original intention, this sensor serves now &quot;eye&quot; for all digital appliances in the world, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC would necessarily transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must resume soon as prepares a draft law. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Now, within that essential domain, there still is much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to see it up close. </seg>
<seg id="151"> It is just a few weeks, Mr. L. lived alone in their apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a reprieve of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I had given five years of life, but already have been thus seven&quot;, relates, made a pass, lying in his bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, reached the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, we couldn&apos;t be prepared for this,&quot; continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease caused havoc: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eat by itself only. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting in front of a tasty lunch, it accepts resigned to help him eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, even smiling, talking to strangers who dedicate attentions, bring him drugs and offered a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that they cure me diarrhea, is humiliating,&quot; she confesses. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found remedy to this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back to his childhood, for certain people, it is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the person&apos;s ability to accept this regression&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of the majority of people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients entering Hospice Centre Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life forecast of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In that State, the team of doctors and nurses that surround them as do not offer &quot;curative&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The greatest fear of the Mrs A., 89-year-old, is to die &quot;conscious and drowned&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made him discover his children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have some good kids,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;No remain me more desire in this life&quot;, he says, before accepting that I will place a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And hopes, in the coming days, a last visit from her son, who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to feed. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They are palliative care that are given when you can not do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help make his death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for each 11,700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little, since we know that someday everyone will end up dying. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors from the Center. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The dying person are offered rinsing of the mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the complaint. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Already not controlled diabetic sugar rate. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we serve beer to Mr. X, who died in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son ended up beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We can help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, Director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the Victor-Gadbois Center days after without ever be the same. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to a 94-year-old man who savor their last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old girl dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Six months ago, it there&apos;s always three to five beds occupied by persons under 45 years suffering from cancer&quot; is disturbed Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% Of the patients who are admitted to the Centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes home and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% Of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in hospital or a care center. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the society of palliative care at home from the Grand Montréal, specialise almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely that great relative deficiency in the Quebec health care what makes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> From the month of October, a manifesto signed by Eminences of the Hospice, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system in Québec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone entitled to quality palliative care until is accepted to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Recently&quot;, he says, &quot;I&apos;ve seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency suffering great pains without necessary to alleviate it has been made. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists insist their patients until the last day, despite the worst odds. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Helene Richard survival hopes were already low ebb when he left a grueling chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that he was very sorry that he wanted to stop fighting&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients seeking to die thank caregivers that do not have attended them in their demands once them has eased her pain with a palliative care team. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, the patients do not respond to treatments against the pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, physicians often use palliative sedation, used to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or on a permanent basis. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, not relieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not alleviated say all the same thing: &apos;I want to die&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not mean necessarily &quot;wants euthanasia&quot;, but &quot;I want I to alleviate&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The preparation of this report was made possible by a grant from Health Canada research institutes journalism. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals of large amplitude in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers for political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia have, day after day, they know a formidable &apos;system&apos;, whereby part of the industry of construction, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that came out too expensive to taxpayers Quebecers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how the system is sprayed one time have hunted big media&quot;, ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Deputy of Quebec and former Chief of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible through a research fund over embezzlement linked to contracts for roads in Quebec, to the liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not consented but in delay. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between industry, illegal party financing and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the research in 2010, only the Ministry of transport has would have saved billion dollars in contracts&quot;, containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already dropped two mayors&quot;, adds, while waiting to get to &quot;demonstrate the existing schemes behind the individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> An anti-corruption permanent unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The anti-corruption permanent unit, created in 2011, applies also with its team of Auditors, investigators and analysts from the Government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit works as well as police from &quot;Marteau square&quot;, which, since 2009, they have made &quot;poster of the sewer system&quot; of Montreal to moderate at the time of inflating contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> These past few weeks, the unit proceeded to registry series of accusations by fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a city on the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resign from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected that it has bagged repeated bribes in Exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Engineers of the road network in Montréal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito has formally accused. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused commotion to the Commission explaining the mechanics of the &apos;system&apos; of public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The same three years paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. zambito handed out money right and left during the 2000&apos;s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted having organized an illegal fundraiser for liberal ex-viceprimera Minister Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The inflation of the cost of sewer contracts </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption effectively ran. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly to the Commission: in ten years received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and payoffs from companies in the construction sector totaling 736,000 dollars, all in Exchange for contracts of sewage whose costs inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in respect of false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the Mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay have done deliberately turn a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies from Montreal who sounded the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As Mayor of the District of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the East of the island, opposed from 2010 the sale of municipal land acquired for $ 5 million and resold by 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% Of the money for campaigns was dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> Research that will finally take place, she says pulling &quot;a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, in order to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> And adds that the process is &quot;painful, but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but a clean in Montreal research unit would need and be very alert to dubious practices do not recur. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but is restless for the role of the &apos; &quot;elected politicians aware of the stratagem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec by 70%, said sarcastically: &quot;have said me that that is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec Government proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;as electoral expenses, are not strictly limit there will be dirty money in politics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Calls for a complete overhaul of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: &quot;we can avoid low; &quot;go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to reconstruct the House a more solid basis, with more controls and laws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to take a look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season he has gained a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How would you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have become. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Advance of day in day at his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also has given me much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And those elements I pushed on a daily basis to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> At a party, that&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything goes very fast in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not acaloro me. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From my early days in the center of pre-training of INF Clairefontaine until my step for Saint-Étienne, I have always advanced by leaps. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You will benefit from the competition, recruited by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruited this summer are accustomed to play very high level matches. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every workout is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That makes a player as I have desire to fight and give everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by attachments such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position I. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Is Ancelotti the man who needed equipment? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspired respect for all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no one equal in Ligue 1 and is among the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that it will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a very encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust that has me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What you think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken us the position of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the knockout style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have much to say against many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to start, finishing the first of our League against Porto to qualify for the knockout round. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> You already have the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to their means so that this project becomes a reality. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to win the Cup in Ligue 1, as last season, it would be a great failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we will invest our efforts in bringing us the title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we did not get far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May we take back a disappointment, since we had the optimum conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, the Montpellier, had a season much better. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I think it will be good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if large equipment such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to take it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that means expect more than the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal they expect much of us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We have fully accepted it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still are with things that reproach ourselves it is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We ask ourselves what more waiting people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> All the weekends can never win 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to launch a game project. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, after two seasons, he has failed to qualify for the second round, and they have also invested a lot! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums spent, I dared with 15 points for the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be to neglect our adversaries and the Championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, &quot;driven&quot; have been by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> That shows that the 1 League is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trofeo. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems completely dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Best that I say we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that it gets a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has come to show that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And it has shown in all the equipment that has passed is a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men who have to its around. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> That pushes others to increase their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows also to all progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How can you&apos;ve experienced Euro 2012 with the France team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was excited to participate in this euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to earn playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and left reinforced. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I managed to play good matches in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I expected from my baptism with the &quot;bleus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is that today we have an exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Do have the vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the &quot;bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> You are getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are well placed in the classification group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork? </seg>
<seg id="346"> That game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before that shock in Spain, had not lived a similar game in my whole career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> The contrary to current monetary exchanges, based in central banks, identified transactions and charges of processing between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for secure Exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer to peer file sharing. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been about 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And near a thousand websites accept the bitcoin as donations or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The price of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell 2 dollars five months later, before returning to haunt ten dollars today (contributions counted on the bitcoincharts.com page). </seg>
<seg id="356"> It is not anything impressive when compared with the global changes in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a published report on the virtual coins in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> In it, described the bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;racing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coin as &quot;credits&quot;, used to advance in a game and that you can earn by playing or you can buy (and even occasionally exchanged). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social networking site Facebook has also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But in all exchanges a central authority controls and treats the changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of an email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, you can also ensure that bitcoins changes contained in the public accounts book, which spreads throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write this new transaction in that book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This passed by resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on the computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this complementary line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase of chipping of file, i.e., transformation of a large file into a numerical mark short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;pick up&quot; the new transaction and add a number prior to &quot;chop&quot; the set. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that offers a particular fingerprint (more zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once that number is found, other nodes easily verified that it is good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to commit a fraud, a user would pay two times with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), the network just would accept as valid two transaction; the other would be an orphan, because they both have different footprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that meet the challenge takes 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Bitcoins in circulation number is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but are divisible to the cienmillonesimo, which leaves a wide margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase of computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;Used failure does not affect the same Protocol&quot;, said Pierre Noizat, you just launch Paymium, a company of payment in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB takes into account also the possibilities of laundering of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash has the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this type. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Giant sales&quot; were launched in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;$ 30,000 Changed&quot;, rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of an educational book on that currency, rather believes in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile contactless, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, leaving thus cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Carrier, also handles your identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to set up in the trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Simply it supply an address that a phone can &apos;photograph and recognize&quot;, points out Pierre Noizat, which guarantees that thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems for most horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Will need some time so that Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> On the other hand, in its report the ECB expected to revalue various risks, today regarded as high, where this coin to succeed. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have come out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops left its area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and that the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished to Afghan peasants, who have considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more injured and the maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign, as in the times of the Soviet army. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks are attached even if their causes. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these are not so when Westerners become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the planted hills of almond trees, thanks to French credits, was made by order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of release, return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of his peasants, overwhelmed by the Al - Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old Mujahedin, the current Government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators, using Government land for resale as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, while benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They&apos;re discredited; most of them have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, I have heard in the field, aspires to a Government which is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, and they will also go to those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and their ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> The modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan have lived and they appreciated its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With around 65% of its population under 25 years, Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, State schools are full of children both girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will have to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish booklets presenting a modern world has great fans across the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will be considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight worry already reconstituted provincial militias, which shall flee away from central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western Nations. However, the United States wanted it transform into a centralized State, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister which existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s or even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has re-established its services, not fixed any reservoir or important irrigation systems have been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported and there is nothing except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, Government control would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumor that Afghanistan had vast mining wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that did nothing more than increase the sense that Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without power to extract minerals of iron or copper of the land and means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese almost have already left the month Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by World Bank) from burrowing the immense Buddha location and remain there as the most important employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> You will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country which depend widely on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The French troops departed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls schools, schools for children, a Department of French at the University, the French Institute, the cooperation in the fields of military, legal, health and agricultural and archaeological delegation support. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, in order to try to &quot;win the hearts and spirits&quot; and perform the impossible task of making matching aid and offensive actions, service of &apos;civilian and military actions&quot;of the Ministry of defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made to bring numerous works of collective interest and actions in dozens of towns of mountain agricultural rehabilitation through a small French NGO. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Those works, sweet for local labor, have been able to help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, fruit trees, Sun protection and increased areas of cultivation. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in those valleys often located over 2,000 meters high. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy received dozens of demands written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> So they quit the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want to, would need to keep a little help civil, well controlled and which reaches them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution with forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play for everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of State had given two months more to this Assembly to finish their work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And nearly two years ago that Egypt used a provisional text, repeatedly modified, weakening the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has not done more to increase the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, President perseveres in its &quot;autocratic delirium&quot; and continues &quot;betraying his word&quot; and &quot;trampled on the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> By their supporters, makes sure that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be organized in the coming 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A period of very short time forcing the brothers to renounce his project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to retrieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in its favour, as stated in an interview with the weekly American Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Considering that this resource has voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: &quot;they vote my text or I keep the full powers&quot;, powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals not attended the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their points of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights, civil society and religious minorities did the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="469"> To achieve the required quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, substitute members, hastily. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> As expected, the rated items have been unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators makes grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so much so that several members of the Committee came to think that the clock of the constituent Assembly was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Article 2 object of attention, is finally still identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that &quot;the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that &quot;principles&quot; could be replaced by &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have allowed a more strict application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Liberals branded as hypocrisy and consider that he is not more than an advertising trick. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They relate, in particular, to article 220, which gives an advisory role, particularly for those who have confirmed their compliance with the laws of the Sharia al - Azhar University. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because &quot;call people to decide is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Here we see the premises of theocracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Fears of Liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the same University would be quite less moderate than at present. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For now, there is no specific religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, we are in the framework of the civil State. </seg>
<seg id="485"> &quot;The majority of Jurists who have been working in this text are not ulema but University students, some of them trained in the French system&quot;, explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> &quot;We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].&quot; </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to pronounce above all this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Apart from its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism relating to the extended powers conferred to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they are few compared with those who were under the previous regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but a National Defense Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The prosecution of civilians nor banned in military courts, as they asked the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> They also showed his concerns about the text, which considered liberticidal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, henceforth, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, the only thing positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word was not included in the previous Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Although Egyptian President was out yesterday evening on television, is provision demonstrations for this afternoon. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The great and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While deputies and human rights activists discuss the consequences that it would bring the law on the mandatory review, have already appeared on the country crooks trading in &apos;fake&apos; certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive to Moscow, Petersburgo and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most are citizens of countries of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Its sole aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> From December 1, comes into force a law, according to which each immigrant labor should conduct a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the field of provision of services, community services, domestic services and trade institutions to the retail. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will not suffice to the exam of the language, if not also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Exception are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Persons who managed to get their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 is not subject to this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Utility, fate and rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of centres will work sponsored by the Institute of language Russian Pushkin, the peoples Friendship University, State University of Moscow, State University of Petersburgo and other Russian higher education institutions. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants may be submitted to the tests in all the cities, now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the examination was backed by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But the rights defenders, much before that law came into force, they managed to often ask this question to the press: and what will bring this in reality? </seg>
<seg id="603"> Will changes bring mandatory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for the migrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, meet representatives from the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering &quot;labor slavery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people today speaks on defence of the rights of labour migrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the Federal service of immigration from Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defense of their rights must start before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organized selection will allow the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Have the problems migrants without profession, education, which does not know the language or pass the medical control. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, mess a &quot;paid trip&quot; to a spooky and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like it are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> In their homeland they promise them one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, deprived of their passports, they do not pay promised wages&quot;, confirms the Director of Division of labor immigration from Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov immigration service. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Do not be angry, jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, while so many citizens of the Central Asian Republics wishing to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country that are intended to go, but also in their own language write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few are the Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks, which can give the luxury of normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone dress them, wear them, and buy them necessary to the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Upon reaching adolescence, these guys dare to work at the earliest opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if you don&apos;t know the language, recognize them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;One feels humiliated and bottom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, in what refers to the language Act, rights advocates point to an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The tests will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they do not have that status, there will be no or review and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or prohibited the passage to strangers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors claim to receive official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, legalization costs money: twelve to sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be made quickly and by only fifteen hundred rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and are cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us one hundred or two hundred roubles for tea or cigarettes,&quot; the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov told journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Come on, don&apos;t be stingy, you buy a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> The first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only documents of registration of immigrants can be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;false&quot; knowledge of the language certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The forged documents were printed in standard color printers. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, came into the hands of new owners not as gift: every immigrant, wanting to be make it easier to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost three thousand rubles for the immigrant worker. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption &quot;diplomas&quot; not to buy, the Government officials and rights defenders converge. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities may promise to migrant workers that they had not have passed successfully the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, will be offered to immigrants who do not speak Russian works that do not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with firearms registered is relatively small </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to civilian gun owners. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the Government&apos;s reaction to the recent incidents: press shots for weddings that fortunately there were no victims, and initiated by the Moscow-based lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, massacre in which press seven people lost their lives. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining license for firearms, 18 years to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law about the possession weapons will be carried to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everyone feels happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot;hardline policy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has released an open letter, whose authors, representatives from various social organizations of shooters, demand that it desist from such &quot;rigor without sense&quot; measures. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimal, he commented to the BBC Russia news service, Vasiliy Lésnikov criminal lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes using firearms registered in bodies of the Interior against the total of 1168 crimes reported for the same period were committed during six months of the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of weapons for civilian use will not be a problem to lead the offender to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low prices. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Vendors: from factories up to official </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapons supplies through various channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who worked in the Ministry of education and the high State for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot of the website which accepts orders from weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first, &quot;vestige of the army or military&quot;, i.e., the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were pilfered by Russian officials and the same Caucasian,&quot; said Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The following type of weapon black, the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by officials of the law enforcement bodies. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military arsenals often there were explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There are versions showed that some fires were deliberately provoked to cover the lack,&quot; says an exmilitar. </seg>
<seg id="663"> As per Baranets, arms manufacturers also put his two cents. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Have now proliferated factories private weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One source of the black market is contraband. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Large amount of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There have their own craft, sometimes, and a mafia that has organized the flow of arms has been formed,&quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where do arms come from? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have calculated what is the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the center of problem analysis and planning of public management. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly available data from sites whose theme revolves around the weapons were analysed by specialists. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons on the black market reached there &quot;because of officials whose work is related to the weapons&quot;, is said in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of the cases is stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to &quot;illegal archaeology&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Dependent of one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name was not mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators not nobody buys them from long time ago because they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he says, providers are directed to military warehouses when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Through any Ensign, the vendor buys a unit, for example a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Removed it from the registry and pass it over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;This takes the weapon to the town and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two Chargers&quot;, tells us </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;But, of course, the police is aware of all the issues, so periodically, when you have to meet the plan&apos;s discovery of crimes, they made test purchases to illegal arms dealers&quot;, adds the dependent. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxury boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who asked me to go to the platform&quot;Begovaya&quot;, where he would be a man who would take me to a&quot;corner&quot;where we could negotiate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the weapon, I found out only there&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Military commentator Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="686"> &quot;I need a friend who has contacts to get a weapon&quot;, says the clerk of the store. &quot;I have a friend as well, but I hope not much in it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> In the markets there are sellers, but there also must be reached, say &quot;on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who called to tell him that a tooth fell from him to her daughter&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> I can even get a pair of mittens of steel through a person&apos;s confidence. </seg>

<seg id="690"> Newbies looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Schemes, in his words, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> They handed him a photo album where there was no &quot;of all&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like in a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> To the buyer, according to Baranets, not offer cat poke: everything can be tested. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, as a potential customer, not only buy; We are going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the weapon to shoot well, we begin to negotiate,&quot; describes the procedure expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shop sofas </seg>
<seg id="699"> Web search engines lead to sites and groups of &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, where it offers to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="711"> The buyer makes payment through an ATM. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, they send you a photo and instructions so you know where it is hidden weapon,&quot; says the Press Secretary of the NGO &quot;The right to arms&quot;, Dmitri Kislov. </seg>

<seg id="722"> Employees of restaurants from fast food and supermarkets in the United States are striking.UU. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of U.S. teens are his first works as cash in &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has started a wave of protests against low wages that are paid in the Walmart Corporation supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> By now no one dares to assert if you will come or not this wave to nine points, or if you have meant losing forces and Taming is in its early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of NGOs on the left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart workers and the system of fast food, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Forty-six cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving Day, called &quot;Black Friday&quot;. That day, United States coomenzaba the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that at times was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their posts and formed picket of protest by unions and activists on the left in the stores of the Corporation, whose products are directed to people of modest and moderate income. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, rifles hunting and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores average between 8% and 27% are cheaper than the larger supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, many low-paid workers from Walmart to buy only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and range of products made from Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of bad working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> That &quot;Black Friday&quot; the participants of the rally demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker from Walmart, received 9.5 dollars per hour, this spending is too high, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The University of California at Berkeley scientists argue that if Walmart increases salary average up to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the Corporation $ 3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than what you spend on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart put the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store them is only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what they spend now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine States and that it did not cause any loss to the Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; lasted in its stores from 8 o&apos;clock Thursday till midnight of the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 articles per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their cash registers were &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the website of left-wing Huffington Post, who left his post &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than &quot;another public relations stunt&quot;, organized by the Trade Union of workers. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where the objectives were not precisely Walmart stores (that in this progressive city they don&apos;t them appreciation, and that for now there is none), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says it sells billions of servings, and then not even grant you the disease down and not pay you for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one WINS less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> Is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of U.S. teens spent by McDonald&apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, on time partial after school, although they still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or plan to stay there long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald&apos;s workers who complain that you have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author says that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&apos;t know what feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday in the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that starts to cashiers and fast food cooks to pay at least $ 15 per hour, i.e., is to double his current wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that labor unions are created in the fast-food sector. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The U.S. law.UU. It prohibits the Administration prevent them this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with tricks and dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, rarely administration easier life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the sector of food rapid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> A major is the excessive turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald&apos;s located near Times Square, involving several local democratic politicians, in particular the Member of the Council Municipal of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says that it is selling billions of servings, and then not even gives you a hospital or pays you for your honest work&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we support workers in the fast food sector to make receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that it deserves every New Yorker&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American history of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But she participated in only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;By now, trick the brain it is not so easy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The subject of the reality augmented, so popular among fans to modern technologies, is lately perceived normally primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Conference, Google showed a model in movement and later, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, a conversation with the head of the Group of interactive 3D technology at Microsoft&apos;s Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, laboratory has elucidated for scientists from the company, the glasses already belonging to a last stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Attracts them the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> -Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> -We are dedicated to the human-computer interaction, but also we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now humanity in its mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the flat-screen pixels, sometimes with finger touches. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since control concerned all gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> -Do more ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> -While Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of this still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, we work in truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It should release the computer world to ours, the physicist, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We will then complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> -Do you think about the control voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A very popular detail, but don&apos;t think they overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> -Clear that cannot be considered him a panacea, remains from resolving the question of privacy, since not always be that others are aware of our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project that we believe in gestures, but not loose, but shorter movements. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but for a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> By now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> -How is that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> -For example, how I asked you which happened this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will speak and show it at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> -Normally I only talk. </seg>
<seg id="803"> -Oh, that&apos;s going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> -Or do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do at this time machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> -Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> -If we talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> You lack resolution, depth, or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> -In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixel camera at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the question is not in megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; This gives more work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Or that we must remember not only the resolution on the x-axis and and, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps really scarce, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond, made a touch sensor with adjustable delay of processing of 1 to 100 ms and is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects to the human-computer interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> To me I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that doesn&apos;t require contact to make the frames per second more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> -The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is actually a simple sensor in the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More number of cameras could potentially solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a similar flexible kinect, playing with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how this will help determine the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> -By what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, sunglasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> -Of course, spend all the time holding up a Smartphone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: the best choice would be a &quot;transmutable&quot; augmented reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass the glasses to your Smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> Sunglasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (the private things only you can see them), but also its weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses won&apos;t let work on virtual objects along with others. </seg>
<seg id="831"> -Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark&apos;s &quot;Iron Man&quot; film, but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem with this idea that the critics often point: there is no touch response! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> Do answers prepare your group for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> -In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand in support to the image quality. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Add touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at provide tangibility to these &quot;images in the air&quot;. For example, the interference of various ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point the finger where gives a sensation similar to which one feels if someone were blowing him in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets wrist affecting the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> -Have you tried to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Do you think he feels it seems that I should feel when they see something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> -That&apos;s a good idea, we have not yet tried it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that you going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not as the gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> By now, trick the brain it is not so easy, you still have to work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality for the investigators, that many things are in a State of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the &quot;Avant-garde of St. Petersburg&quot; project, dedicated to citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best are bright figures of the art and the scene of Petersburgo, whose achievements go beyond the city: often found recognition in Europe while Russia meet them even. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is like the artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Citywide met Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red top down, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, near the summer garden or fashion meetings and inaugurations. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Pictures of Kirill Miller always attracts crowds, wherever they are displayed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilosofos of Petersburgo storytellers, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of Petersburgo of late 80s - early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in people smiles and lifts all mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organ of Petersburgo, since it has matured to make difficult role, by its Bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> -Kirill, are why going around town dress of red and not yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> -I chose red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and the society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in the society, everything that is not grey arouses aggressiveness and agitation of not good properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are aimed to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> -When would have understood that you should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> -In an exhibition of the Palace of culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old unofficial artists had finished, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became a friend of artists from the new wave, with subsequent who risked in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to the &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and already the new wave is over. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sumí me in the theatre by the clothes, the music of all genres, but not by the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this joined in your art clinic... - for me it was important to meet me at the cultural center of Petersburgo, where the best creative minds had to come together. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, Bohemian club, the Bohemian of Petersburgo House. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to &quot;La oreja de Van Gogh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and his friends sang songs light under the phonogram, they wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the Group began to play live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was organizer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of a great career; basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, the &quot;Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the art clinic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="877"> There went our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the award was &quot;The people of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the year&quot; I was elected I, thus ended my completion. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In these changing times, it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who like truth, honesty, and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our times, it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity go separate. One may be popular but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> -Something in your work recognizable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> -Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed today and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I&apos;m going to do a scheduled exhibition, &quot;Museum Russian clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used to be sociable, but now so is painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns all smear and tragedy is eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, grotesque ideas I have. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and required change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now they remain one for clothes, focusing in the external, but not in the inner person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps that person not due him or shake hands, but spitting in your face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be deleted when you change clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> -Recently we see you in the role of urban organ. -A cultured city needs a hero as well. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than me to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But maybe commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> -Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people gathered in herds, the Bohemian wanted one thing, the greenhorns other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into micro communities, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a one hundred dollar bill to appeal to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we must think like who like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each hero worship has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> -Van to see him in the abandoned, there runs the sex-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event are 300 people, 10,000 will ever come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the most important thing is not to trick them, do not spoil what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young it was such pictures that a collector had them hung on the Wall beside Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I began with paintings, which usually people ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now they often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, that&apos;s another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> -Kirill, what is what is missing Petersburgo? </seg>
<seg id="916"> -Good experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can dedicate itself to the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the Kings were correct it was otherwise, the Kings perhaps did not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there is now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in Petersburgo that could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level to correctly assess these and open them way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Subjective personal taste is now thriving. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> -What is for you Petersburgo? </seg>
<seg id="925"> -St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there are lot more culture, there is land. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones is difficult art to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural field and now have more writers than readers, this is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity that attends exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is negligible. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We have to make the art of fashion, as it did at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be executed with a grant of Petersburgo. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spaceships with humans aboard depart in search of a planet&apos;s replacement. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To preserve mankind the main question becomes: how continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet replacement? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think there is little to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says researcher head of State Astronomical Institute, Vladimir Surdin, Sternberg P.K. (IAES). </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Only you can live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago that experiments were carried out with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit not differed in nothing of terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding of insects at the orbit, small fruit, the Drosophila flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> As a result, we obtain a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that this chick has to find support, must be kept on their feet and begin to move,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of problems biomedical (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Finding no support, the chicks gave flips randomly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in the newly born gave a total atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks did not react to light or sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the misfortune was that four days after simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice got the chicks to be born, but then leave it because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time that a biological &quot;miniarca&quot; flew into orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the biosatelite &quot;Bion&quot; will travel only species of same-sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space already with fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, nothing was found supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;This was precisely in the biosatelites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be done,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, still has not been directly address the problem of reproduction in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, lose their usual habitat, simply cannot be their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel into space for the last 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Tereshkova became the highest risk. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Seagull flying, and no one on earth could say: If after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> You may or not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, this question no one has responded&quot;, says veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> It was also the father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, Cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We are few, are counted the astronauts who after long flights all has been well, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if it is more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights&quot;, summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, mankind should seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hydrolaboratory facility of the cosmonauts preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> In conditions of zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts practice their skills of work in the space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment for an adult, a child newly born is its native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that the life on Earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, then it will be easier to get then to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath, they spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little to forget something&quot;, says Navy representative, instructor swimming of newborn infants. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if weightlessness is a natural state for a newborn, for women is required the gravitation, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Weightlessness in the abdominal and pelvic muscles is very fast, decrepitan reduces the ability of expulsion of the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, give birth in a Special Chamber, this will push it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;Do, then what?&quot;, Valeri Polyakov is made this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the sense of gravity, the organism does not generate skeletal and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> To a newborn in orbit is impossible to dress it with a special suit for training as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply deprived of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring the Earth to a disabled person, a person totally outdated&quot;, provides for the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKU Chief: inspection of the system &quot;švarc&quot; has failed to comply with the politician guilty </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limps. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect&quot;, but its application must be correct. &quot;This is, in my opinion, what we lack&quot;, describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of a wrong practice, mentions of Petr Nečas attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;švarc&quot; System. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, it is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in this case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the performance of the Office having the obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations,&quot; notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Committee on control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning public contracts in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly is? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It&apos;s a parallel control that we started to make some two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how it should organize public allotments, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country, and then the praxis itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We it have combined everything and, although control is not finished yet, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is &quot;stricter and more comprehensive&quot;, however, some parameters in concrete praxis is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> He is confirmed, therefore, that is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> In fact what you can this project provide? What do you think are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Precisely a common control of this type might help that I stopped investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this has a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of savings means getting a thing suitable for a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, eventually, criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not by the fact of reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to get it. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Maybe it&apos;s because the system is saturated with so much &quot;paperwork&quot;, that those who want to find faults in the system can do so more easily than if the limits remain as high as it is now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You speak problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation regulating the practicaa of the public auction. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of controls in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> It is similar to our NKU Office or is organized in a different way? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for the offices, such as the NKU, there it acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court), with an organization similar to ours, with a college also, only thing is that if it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Competencies are also to some extent similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of audit are even at this level. In this regard it differs slightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of accounts (BRH) can control only the federal money, what we here call State funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are handled in the Federal Court. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In terms of local law, it is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not make a comparison without facts. However, Germany is still a model in some aspects, but can not point out exactly what is best. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That surely no, but, I repeat, I don&apos;t like doing this type of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It goes without saying that even those countries that we took as a model must deal with a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If wasn&apos;t so not it would mean them no benefit to collaborate with our Office, don&apos;t you think? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In terms of the legislation of our country, what it mean for your Office the amendment of law on public contracts? Its incidence occurs in some way? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, yet not manifested in the actions of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since we carry out controls ex post, must have a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> By now, is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have started a new &quot;non-economic risk detection&quot; tool, which have made passing nearly 14,000 public allotments, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the boundaries are changed, will rectify the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, involved a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the regulations &quot;hardens&quot; and which is impossible to comply with it. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already the previous regulations, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional Council), with each law not respected in the field of public auction meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> It make sense then toughen the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to attack him or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no incidence in decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> A system of this type will only create more bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how is out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We&apos;ll see where it takes us this started way. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister has recently declared that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with the so-called švarc system controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is švarc system&quot;prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the performance of the Office having the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;We change the law and allow it&quot;, but can not say that we will make as if nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the law on the public auction, the regulations are fairly strict in terms of how that should be done formally. And that&apos;s as it should be to protect the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that it exclude the candidate with the best deal for failing to meet the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Highways are plates of ice, although they are mostly passable </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places in the Czech Republic roads have plates of ice and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Although most of the roads are passable, in some caution must be extreme. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> It is said that in a little less than a month will reach the end of the world, what about it? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one among many other alarming news like that grab us. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The music group The Tap Tap like us rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of world music that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, in December to organize a really original project: three concerts for the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> You explain it to readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It&apos;s a state charity event that we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to take advantage of the potential of marketing that has the end of the Mayan calendar stated on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end approximately at the same time the end of the Mayan calendar in the Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> To who came you this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> It was initially my idea, after we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the State that the world we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar also have created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key chains against the end of the world can be found at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the called hymn against the end of the world, entitled &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is currently very popular on YouTube, is you will hear in the charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, Yes, and be just the last, well, provided that everything goes well and the world is not finished... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> All performers will sing it at the same time at three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Hymns are linked each other simultaneously thanks to the special broadcast live on Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the role of Jesus in the video, where he also sang Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work together with other personalities from the cultural scene in Czech, apart from organising many charity events and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our efforts in participating in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the money raised at the concerts for the end of the world go? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Jedličkův Tap ústav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly visited by teachers that are fun and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students do not have the economic means to pay teachers and make an effort to make it possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building which we will move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert they act several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We try to develop a program that is attractive to all ages, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For more detailed information, check out www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you have planned some other &quot;spectacular&quot;similar action in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May we will act for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Also coming year I would like to touch in the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I&apos;d like to fill it with performances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as difficult as it may seem at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five members in electric wheelchair, wheelchairs must travel in the baggage compartment and in addition we carry much weight, boxes with instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, so far we have managed us well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, not to let something that surprises me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where they have returned recently, left everything without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have you found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the East, is a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common that a person moves one by the center of the city in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There it is not something as current as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Luckily, a civil association that strives to make the problems of persons with disabilities has been created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In which aspects should we take example of more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many aspects in which we are going back... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is very normal people with a severe disability to move on their own in public and can go to the service, the Museum, wherever... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common to a large number of people with disabilities to participate in the social life in an active way, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap go a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when it comes to which arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything really. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, are isolated cases of people who have a strong willpower. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if you look a few years ago, what you did to form the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> As an educator I entered Jedličkův ústav, where many young people had to my around wanting to dedicate himself to something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, toco, among others, saxophone, founded an amateur group with a coworker. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, left us a little hands (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that he helped us quite the fact connected with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that work not seen, is as if it does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to aid from the European Union, we cannot allow ourselves also teachers of quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you have intention to get away with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I saw the potential that had, that anything can be done otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment industry is full of things that resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Not surprisingly, in his own way, everything new is home gingerly and takes long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who sees us for the first time clearly is compassion, it is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is completely superfluous because disabled people are not abandoned beings who suffer and that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that the necessary means available. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say if anything goes well to people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Did the fact that is you a demanding boss, as described by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think that it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the high school test, and spend much time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that&apos;s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open Group, people coming in and out, it cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone with the will and desire to always find the doors open </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday at 9 p.m. 20.12.2012 </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Plynojem in Ostrava and Brno Fleda and will participate in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Three cities can be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the Group The Tap Tap song &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The concert aims to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the school without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, whose cost amounts to CZK 25 million. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entrance at the option of advance sales at Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At the meeting of Ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency last week he accepted Poland as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of that the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in the Commission of projects of the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, the path of Poland toward the cosmos began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Polish enthusiasts already engaged flights into space before the second world war, although their work is not always understood. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the Conference of a. Šternfeld in the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw, on December 6, 1933, presented his ideas on the study &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics&quot; pioneer. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) let the audience indifferent, and years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 Šternfeld won the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch by his &quot;Introduction to Astronautics&quot; in France. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, became later a great promoter of astronomy and Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the dark side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a draisine which would be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used for the start-up of the draisine or for its braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this draisine is limited to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the year 1933 Polish artillery began to devote himself to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the preserved material, it becomes evident that research came to the stadium for practice tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of the German troops, stopped the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 he appeared in press and the prototype of a missile of photoelectric hunt designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba lotnicza i&quot;, of Leliwa-Krzywoblocki author. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Scientific Advisory Committee interim (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missiles for military use techniques and coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the onset of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies devoted to Astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The edition of November 1954 in the magazine Problemy refers first to the society with four extensive articles devoted to Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> One of them, prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time already had implemented projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the international Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He held this post until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that was carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and not reaching the 5 kg of weight. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, was it completed version RM-1A and air tests of the RM-2 rockets in two stages in the Błędów desert began in the summer of 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 meters and weighed in at about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of rocket in development would be subject to actual scientific study. RM-34 rocket would have a height of 14.5 km and its mission was to control height wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, the works were suspended in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> It was designed as a rocket in two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, - 1B and - 1 c), differing among themselves by the space available for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the Meteor-1A rocket available volume space was 0.4 litres, 0.34 liters Meteor-1B and the Meteor-1 c of 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum height in three types was of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 was developed at the Institute of air rocket Meteor-2, whose first air tests were initiated in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 rocket was a starting weight of 380 kg and capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> The Meteor - 2 H and Meteor-3 version was built later. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR Committee two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law social traabajos. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution sparked a heated discussion in the society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means that various economic forms and national economic systems are permanent conflict each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with the rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of large differences in labour costs (of salaries) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and this &quot;causes a bajadda&quot; of the price of the competitor in order to take over most of the market and, thus, increase their profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large scale means, for most employers, move production abroad, buy there more cheaply or even disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour in comparison with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since private capital has no social responsibility any and, thereby, nor is responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, necessarily grows the social expenditure of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This entire situation conducive to the total disinterest of the businessmen to pay taxes, and offset economic and social damage that has provoked in an effort to obtain benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is universally as known to is not necessary to submit specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Situations, is created by the unscrupulous practices of private capital in certain economies, in which the Governments of such countries are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of the population and, thus, attract foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Put another way, the Governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is evident especially in the changes of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, using the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Since a number of years ago, exist in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who can not keep up with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people receiving such aid already reaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employees with a salary so low that the State must pay the rest to reach the absolute minimum to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A scandal of this type relating to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal Parliament became public. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Virtually all the States of the South of the EU saving measures drive, without doubt, the same situation. People, pressed by a huge decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with a lousy salary on the edge of society, in the hope that someday reach the private investor capital country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is necessary to preguntrarse comes from where? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the event that in the case of other countries in the EU, then poverty passes from one country to another or doesn&apos;t ever since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a fraction of the European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and the media claim over and over again that the State should not provide capital to the economy, steering the economy leading to its failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the State should not intervene in the economy to meddling in the control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It is then necessary to wonder whether private capital not influences with his selfishness in the political progress and, therefore, throughout the State. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The test is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent, practice in all States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in the mutual favors, on legislation which is practically condemned everywhere but is not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, lack of financial means, responsible for the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This type of bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> In this way, all power not emanates from the people, as advertised in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups representing their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation how which describes Appianos in his book the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeii: &quot;the State had long disintegrating and administrations occupied by force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In Exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and helps to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption spread without impediment and people went to the polls with the vote agreed beforehand... &quot;there were people with character who aspire to a position in the Administration, so once, because of this disruption, the State was eight months without consuls&quot;... &quot;He began to talk seriously of the autocracy was the only remedy for a bad situation and that it was necessary to choose a strong man&quot;... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and became autocracy democracy forever. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today&apos;s society relies on inconsiderate preferences of individual profit without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not capable, in its essence, understand and claim the benefits of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as the then, decline of the elite record, without that an effort be made to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the rise of fascist and Communist regimes seek, therefore, in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a democracy of liberal types, such as a definite pause, waiting for the next hit. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The really damning fact is that current elite ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution; at least not in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is to concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the participation of State capital and influence of citizens in Government and which undermine the monopoly position of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: chaos laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (No surge nothing of violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads &quot;Let&apos;s do not forget how fragile we are&quot; (not forget how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my children did not want wars, there would be no&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in the year 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have sprung up, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defence and typecast to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and stigmatizes a terrorist State Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation, and did not live the beginning of violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to provide readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of tensions being dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, other conclusions which I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the topic, about who or which group of people is the main promoter of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of humanity the history of struggles for power is at Ringside. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time we find an Alexander the great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what isn&apos;t so obvious is if these characters were always who directed his steps independently or if behind his throne, there was someone who aimed their actions toward a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, has not been able to arrive in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> These astronomically wealthy families include one that could be considered the most prominent (if there are still someone back, I don&apos;t know, but I do not rule out it): the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written close to them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Naturally. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first News Agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered them shoulders, thing that they always meant a fortification. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have important stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries which are not represented, declared or is preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, after overthrow Gaddafi only four remained, but meanwhile Russia has subject the central bank to the Russian Government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the civil war to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve (FED) system and he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting to sue the fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of the year 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> His desire for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Albert Pike mason, awarded to the 33rd degree. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was marked aimed to eliminate the large Royal States throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Great Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the Earth&apos;s population between half a million and one billion people (like number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for similar solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method with which operates the richest families, along with the Rothschild Group, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of the crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions, however, are wrong, and always involve a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that no repeat of a crisis as the year 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, risking the first world war, destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended suddenly and unjustified from the point of view military and economic, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end with the Tsarist Russia were now unnecessary) and the further dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To prepare the ground for the second world war, allowed that the bankers and politicians create, in stealth mode, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which created optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough them to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out to guilty, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority which should represent and represented as well the role of the fifth column, which lit the flame and led to the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild led to the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the old Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above paved the way for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> World War II broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled the rope to which international bankers had it tied at first or if everything he did was part of a plan too. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish State in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way that war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel was created the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers got to start it, the Jewish nation, like that in the second world war, become victim at first line of combat, now together with the population Arabic or, usually, Muslim in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of their country, but also on an international scale. Take for example how are divided so emphatic supporters and opponents of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in a spiral of violence interminable, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its agents because, as it happens in our country, international bankers have only their candidates in elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal to the international bankers, politician who makes everything possible to declare war on Iran, and considering that they Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and if we take into account that they Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil (navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under which light will now display the words that gave David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population served by a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which each new individual is implanted him a chip at birth that he controls his entire being. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be marked in the right hand or on his forehead, to not be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of your name.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand it: anyone with half a brain, which add the numbers of this monster. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The number marks a person and this number is six hundred threescore and six&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Argo film: If it is crude, call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release would be in Exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which, after the revolution, fled to the United States.UU, which had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive Outlook: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since if he did so, he endangered the confidence of partners in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the United States.UU., his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter front Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The &quot;Argo&quot; of director and actor Ben Affleck Film puts an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before occupying the Embassy, six employees of the building escaped. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got out of Iran, this helped a covert history a quirky point: went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan which charted the &quot;exfiltration&quot; Toni Mendez expert required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To make the lie seem truthful, he wrote about the film project in journals, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company had even a real Office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has become from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck film is a unique combination of various genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; another, called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the Ocean&apos;s Eleven series). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film, moods are combined. On the one hand are well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credits sequence shows iconic photographs from the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; There are not many differences in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> By the other, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And in addition, scenes of the central of the CIA and other institutions: men suits that analyze the situation at the table of negotiations, in the halls of the Office, by phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been subject to ridicule, has become a respectable director and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third feature film, after &quot;Little bye, bye&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of thieves&quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that located to old movies above standards of Hollywood directors. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck shows in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;wheel&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the Embassy is impressive by its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the excitement of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (team imposter in the Tehran Bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that an explained history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And manages quite well. Sometimes adds something to the reality: here does not leave everything so so smart (the scene in which lurks the crisis at Tehran airport, deviating from a call to America and rampant after his track search become insane). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the lack of control arising from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny as collaborators of Hollywood role, although their characters deserved more space and are not, nor much less, the only ones in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, Affleck Film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that you can continue with a moderate interest, assess their implementation and style retro of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But that collapse, that will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As evocation of a true story and as proof of the exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, banana and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on &quot;the regulation or the most absurd ideas from the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans approved a quota of 40 per cent of women in management in large European companies&quot;, said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unifying the insurance contracts between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far, women was nailbiting best prices on life insurance because they objectively represent one lower risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at end of February 2013 &quot;, reported Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the compulsory addition of biocomposites fuel which, as a result, harms the environment environment; Another prohibition is the use of life mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or guideline sombre the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> He has been criticized factual prohibition of use of the term &quot;butter spread&quot; or the withdrawal of the classic bulb retailers. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A banana of quality must have a length of 14 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The appliance of the Union takes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by any State or group of States (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claiming the demands of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> A lobby interests were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 cm in the EU and could not present &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended saying this only seeking harmonise national rules not homogenized so far, just complicating your marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some States, have softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the EU last year according to which in the inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years old are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU made reference here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Also existing is a similar restriction applicable to the use of Tuesday&apos;s children up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Strange occurrences are born even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone having any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To not offend the sensibilities of Greece, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnipoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, some absurd proposals referred to above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of the food supplies in the territory of a Member State. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic the same day from our entry to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, volume set for mushrooms canned, which earned him a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Also interested to the organizers of the survey the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for grant application. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas arose not in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage by not having sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We ask the EU compensation&quot;, said in fall 2004 the then Minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued it with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention buying, the State had full warehouses and had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of the grain of the countries that have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of requests for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Rare requirements are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the Member States are often target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations, also operation and development more effective throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the payment of grants from the EU for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Czechs also have to chord, in the same way that other countries of the Union, fighting for the right to the designation of origin of its traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the cheese of Olomouc, but had to change the name to national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as &quot;tuzemak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of appellations of origin, protected from the EU, together with the cheese feta and gorgonzola known around the world, from the German city Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already for example cookies of Karlovy Vary, carp Pohořelice and of Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops from Žatec. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> As cameras protected from the EU can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the waffles of Hořice v Podkrkonoší. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want to save the Republic, but I&apos;m a fan, says Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how it occurred to him to present to the election for President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not to be Senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything in our country, then he would not my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But now I can not stand to see how steals in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age are increased. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> He had no ambitions of being a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something that I don&apos;t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a Senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senate it has already arrived, but shortly thereafter has been on the road to the Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it not giving back to those who have voted for it? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that my candidacy for the Presidency depended on the results in the election of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> I later stated that if he was elected Senator, he would present my candidacy for the Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my goal is not function; the function is the tool with which my own ideas can make reality. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive to anyone who wants to initiate a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In this addition to the media, you discrediting and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> Me it is said I bribed journalists or that I have been Advisor of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let&apos;s talk about your ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It occurs to the presidential fight with thesis financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the Declaration of the property above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do this you must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure so that guide nursing recognized as autonomous work, and we got it. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the policy: If someone arrives with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, it is rejected by the way and this affects the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, have a greater potential to obtain the support of all parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without prejudices and dogmas of party, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Considered rather a man right-wing or left-wing? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I consider more than left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it doesn&apos;t matter, whether it&apos;s a bit of left-wing or right-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters to me is that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I don&apos;t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always support openly any good solution, regardless of if the proposal comes from the KSČM or from the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It makes joke when we say you that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing it with what it says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try to get close to them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak already run the world or known experts speak of them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the Parliament there only are slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And thus cannot survive in politics in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that if it is directed at people and talk to them, will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to get it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If you were elected President, there would be no problem to organize a live broadcast on TV in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties they legitimize the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and State prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they would have to communicate why you do not want to. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character who says disputes, can be pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for example the direct election of the President, who has been an achievement of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I say that I&apos;m just a fan, I&apos;m not a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just started in politics and try to obtain the greatest possible support for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try to take things forward myself, but should not leave well, within six years I will leave it and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a bit as if Okamura to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> No I&apos;m no Savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that with a person I do not do anything, so I have visited a number of well known personalities, if maybe they are encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, I have at least supported journalist Jana Lorencová research, which brought to light the light from heating oils fraud. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> Myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I&apos;m in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did voted in representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people elected the Senate, in such a way that it will be difficult to achieve change. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I will defend my own ideas, like for example the direct election of mayors and Governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering to form his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Even I have not considered it because I don&apos;t have time for this, to check the past unblemished from each of the potential members of the party, or do not have money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I don&apos;t have money for the campaign for the Presidency, there are only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Don&apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Speaking of declarations of the property, how is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property at $ 60 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artwork with a value of ten million, Aston Martin of some 3.5 million and a Superb valued at one million, and in the account Škoda I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the iniquities and injustices. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Driving an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You says that you want to change the Republic but does not want to put too much money on your part. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I have to borrow me? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign, I&apos;ve already 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that it does not have any sponsor demonstrates that there is not too much interest in my program. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Campaign expenses covered in essence what you will receive in respect of Senator salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But he could not live it. For example, it could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If you only wanted to make money, then I would not pursue as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So it will continue with its business activity to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Not has it said before that he was going to leave this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has nothing to do with one higher salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I have promised, partly I have stopped my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like to be the Samaritan who saved the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> As it is customary to win monthly as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I&apos;m still gaining. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If you were President, then I would leave the business. </seg>

<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally have something interesting to see,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who passed down the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, tecnico de TI in a large company located near the library, says: &quot;in addition, the building is beautiful&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask for what we need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, tablets and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one enters by taste in those libraries, old fashioned, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a bedroom city situated at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious distinction of having won a record for forgetting. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the Netherlands lower literacy rate. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counteract this so embarrassing, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy seven fictitious bridges that are represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated concrete miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And it was as the responsible politicians decided that there was only a possibility to improve the statistics: there was to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and head of fun buildings while cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And as the jury looked perplexed at its around and it shrank from shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: &quot;dear fellow citizens:&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, the so-called &apos;Boekenberg&apos; &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, EUR 30 million mountain rises in the intended place. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of the revitalization project, which comes complete with an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is also nominated to the &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In this way, the small town devoid of story, which to date had nothing more to offer that a postmodern pedestrian area and a city incredibly ugly behind whose facade one white intuiría rather a central Dairy now boasts a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that it is a haven of books under a cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> It is true that there is a lift which transports us right at the center of this massif, but real lovers of space and reading don&apos;t use it, they prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climbing to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The all-glass interior is bright and easy to cover with the tab, annealed brick floors and elegant lanterns support unequivocally the public status of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Boost view can be displayed the park benches, the dogs and the children playing soccer. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;The shelves of books are usually arranged along the facade and in the Centre opens a huge dark room which, in general, tends to be somewhat inconvenient and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we are we&apos;ve done put upside down the classical spatial configuration and take the reading from the inside to the outside area. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is very well spent: in the middle are offices, the Internet Library, chess club, environmental education center and the maintenance room. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and balustrade at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, touch and smell are strange. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and civil engineers, more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so as a day, on a farm frize, we stumbled upon the right coming from agriculture by-product. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands used a woven plastic of few millimeters thick as a base to hold the roots of the crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This tissue lasts two seasons and then is discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> This tissue is crimped to the library, for the first time in such amounts, until four inches thick plates. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a dark, uniform and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps, we reach the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this continuous road about 500 meters around the mountain ahead of us the reward: from the coffee shop not only has a fantastic view of the city, but that it also can enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its planted huge potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time maintaining the humidity adequate for this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;Hard to believe it given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology&quot;, says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> While books mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the Sun only shines during few hours inside. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The massive wooden trusses situated transversely to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the Sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a comfortable indoor climate. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, skeptical of the information technologies sector worker, already has dared to set foot on the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Similarly, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; as the &quot;late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration which took place a couple of weeks ago were invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> In this way is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that still does not have its full file; It currently has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has permeated deep. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are packed with. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a library half empty&quot;, says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although only is there to decorate. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the MVRDV Studio has achieved a success in that discipline Queen who specialized slang known as &quot;creating an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Regardless of the young and uneducated to be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally a starting point to shape its identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabó: &quot;Germans should play a role more&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany had abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on us-China relations. USA-Europe, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant the status of an observer State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, Berlin finally declined. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn&apos;t support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that it also supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when that issue was to establish a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has finally been declared by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when they are important international issues at stake? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, so. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to that currently it is refocusing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy-led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And making it even more difficult things is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they are still groping to what will be their role, but they have already started a foreign policy towards &quot;normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What you mean specifically a &apos;normal&apos; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions other than the United States or its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I think that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e., in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> German economic interests are to a certain extent different from other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote on the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> This is why you must be careful and not to alienate the Arab public opinion nor the Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I do not give so much importance since it is not a completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, if they play a fundamental role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany undermined their relationship with us. UU. to abstain from voting on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not think a break so drastic as in the case of Libya has occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Finally and ultimately this has only demonstrated that it is a country take that seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, us. UU. It has been clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There is disparity of views between us.? UU. and many European Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been these disparities due to American domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration shows a great understanding toward the European position secret. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation it is living here, is clear that the Government cannot defend in public that position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think the real disparity of opinions does not actually the importance attached to it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If we analyze the relationship between Obama and israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusiastic about politics that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult to reconcile Germany close relations maintained with Israel and United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that it is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course that would be a little easier for Germans if there is a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a greater entity, but it must promote things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that Germany will assume a leadership role when it comes to force Europe to adopt a European stance in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course that this is not easy for Germany, whether simply by the relationship that it has with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a tricky issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> See Germany itself in the role of an important international actor? You would in reality Germany assume a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Do or perhaps continues finds it difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany have not been used, is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a major player, certain antialemanes feelings are unleashed. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It&apos;s an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this way, Germany is a lot more difficult than United States position. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> You have to show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that&apos;s not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the United States. UU. in European policy decreases more and more, but the EU does not cover of time that vacuum, who is left then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> It will not be the Germans no choice but to assume a role more protagonist. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like them, if you find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America discusses form joint challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, which specializes in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of brands&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani have become suddenly Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is also a known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But, what Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but that it has nothing to do with the original Companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not present a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear that they go to give the reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;The foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect its brands in China&quot;, says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of rights of protection in extreme East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week comes to my table a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators just added a couple of letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is recorded. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sporting goods manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a Cabinet where he keeps Beijing Trademark Office seats. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name brand that also served the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese are world champions in that copy and violate the rights of intellectual property is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities there are stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of fakes. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, Pattloch cases are otherwise. On behalf of its customers, he fights against the fact that the Trademark Office grants the right to capitalize on a name that is already registered in another place in an official way to Chinese companies. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese called it &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or brand Companion. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;, </seg>
<seg id="1649"> that refers to women who have &quot;fished&quot; to a rich man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is harmful to the business, they must fight against it requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand does not hold water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the costs of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially iconic luxury products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data from the Chinese company&apos;s market analysis CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year is, in size, the third market of luxury goods, and which grows to greater pace. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the register of marks is difficult and also means lots of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the Court dismissed a lawsuit because he had spent so long that the name object demand already had become a &quot;market reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;If the plaintiff has bad luck, may even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged this brand in China&quot;, says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by German manufacturer of Schwing concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, was used at the beginning a logo in white and blue that largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter is settled in court and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile facing in the direction opposite to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The CTMO in Beijing Trademark Office recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, &quot;the labor emergency situation returned to normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the amount of claim without processing processes has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 claims are still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fight against this costs lots of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As it is usual in China, the numbers are surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, nearly one third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It would be a new record and means that China leads the new inscriptions on the world list, for the tenth consecutive year according to the Trademark Office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this also occurs with the number of valid logos, figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 Yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Fight against this cost much money, as evidenced by the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> More than seven years the Group fights a Chinese copycat in the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Even though the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> imitator has managed to make sure Chinese rights on the trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected,&quot; said Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the appeal of the Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the following two instances have given him reason to Freudenberg, but the other party is still fighting today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You must be very careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where he is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler relies on to favorably resolve the issue and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also says that &quot;the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the enterprise archive has had to review records of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg offered a &quot;six-digit euro sum&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement to the opposing party, but was unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much that matters,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that lurk in the far East threaten even with affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> specifically if imitators sure there not protected trademark rights. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Long ago the Group abandoned this trade, however attained prevent registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You have to be very careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommended German companies are extremely cautious when it comes to doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights legislation, but is what you need to do &quot;also recorded in China everything that may be eligible for protection&quot;, as it aims Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, where Freudenberg lost the final round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay to the other party licensing rights by their own name, as it explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question we expel market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The world day against AIDS: dancing, singing, help </seg>

<seg id="1705"> First start for dance:, cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and loafers looking the compass on the parquet floor, and found it quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of singers (Alto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, hindering it and following each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to leave almost their boxes while trying to place order with their energetic and soft gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It&apos;s Monday afternoon and in the music of the psychology Institute Heidelberg medical room Imbongi choir rehearses a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also reached from the human geneticist to the master of House. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos;Obani&apos; is not an easy piece, each voice choir has a different and also in a foreign language hardly known text: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate from UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The Association Voices for Africa has been found in Germany godparents for 180 the Esitjeni village AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend high school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover tuition for school uniform and will guarantee you a warm meal a day at the Gogo Center. </seg>

<seg id="1722"> In this room nobody knows this bantu language fluent, but sing know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Ten years ago this choir rehearses songs in this soft language that occasionally manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> 8.733 Km of straight-line distance from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on this German choir voices. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent is infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Esitjeni is a small example of what it affects Swaziland: more AIDS infection rate high and the lowest life expectancies around the world, according to Unicef. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that it has shown it halved the risk of contagion. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than thirty years has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir found this hidden population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> No school title, the possibilities in a poor country are scarce. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially it was only the particular commitment of some few which made it possible that a child off to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, a year later the choir founded the Association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; which since then has dealt professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the major sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The ETS of bacterial origin include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The most common Viral STD are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Crabs and scabies are among STD transmitted by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more often in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute part of the base that at least four of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases are infections by chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV between heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; However, approximately 20% of all new HIV infections occur in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, chlamydial infections are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to most common diseases among youth. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections evolved? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections remains a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It&apos;s one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Do symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital tract, discomfort while urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can one protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not offer 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, experts recommend to regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if frequently change of sexual partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured and is possible to avoid any late result. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through partnerships, donations, and last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for performances in all Germany, arrive to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In total have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni&quot;, says proud Annette Lennartz, President of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the own town Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of herself and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It deals with the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The &quot;gogos&quot;, as it is called to the older Zulu women, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans in her charge, offer a roof to live and deal with that children attend school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who do not have anyone left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 children hungry, collecting a salary from the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has launched a sewing school, has built two houses and, in collaboration with the organization health American PSI, has managed that many of the inhabitants of the town have undergone an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not something obvious, since, despite the obvious is this disease throughout the country, is usually not talking openly about it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A King with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Something strange in a country where the King is officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its full of excesses and opulent lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life not formally accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also due to the numerous seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to another and carrying it beyond where van. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> It is another culture, here only accept contact skin against skin &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southern tip of the African continent still remind of the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white singing songs in a language of blacks; such recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and great joy, but it has also managed to extract a couple of tears to some another rabid border soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey leads them always to Esitjeni, where singers visited to sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> While this small population barely appear on maps, in the Valley of the river Ezulweni is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Approaching Esitjeni, there shines the light&quot;, says the people of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after the 8.733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the singers with the Bergheimer Street rehearsal rooms marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see your light shine from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice in mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the planet closest to the Sun, there also there is ice water, as are the conclusions of three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow a layer of ice has formed. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that this has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water presumably comes from kites or, with great probability of asteroid which collided against mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Nobody relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the head of the probe, Messenger, Sean Solomon researcher. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help clarify how they have come to the water and other components of life elsewhere in the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Completely silently for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time send images to Earth: small Windows to the vastness of space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets that comprise our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, rotating around the Sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not no &quot;planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; in which countless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although more difficult to recognize is the pink color of the &quot;newborn&quot; stars. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of star formation, called little romantically by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The donut-shaped ring is composed of material that Star spits in their process of extinction. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> The huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years of Earth, form new stars from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The NASA Spitzer telescope took this photo of Galactic star-forming area. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also known with the nickname of &quot;The seven sisters&quot;, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, with the telescope colors you can see better. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The Helix nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It lies 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image leads to a spectacular colorful. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This star in the making could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: how originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Probably it is remains of one of the moons of Saturn that disappeared without leaving trace 4,500 million years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image posted by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located thousands of light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Trifida comes from the Latin term &quot;dendropanax&quot; (divided into three), since a dark lines of dust divided the burning heart of this star-forming region into three lobes. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ophiuchus astronomers could photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million years Earth light nuclei of the two galaxies in the process of fusion is leap one towards the other to finish crashing irretrievably. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to her with the nickname of grinder Austral. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The Nebula located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than the particles of dust that can be found in a House. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created based on optical imaging and x-rays made by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Displays a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time of model for the NASA Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists called the spiral galaxy&apos;s largest UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> This Nebula is the Group&apos;s brightest young stars of our Milky way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This star-forming region constantly produces new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, also new arise continuously star; 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this Galaxy so bright with a small black hole yet there is no dust, gas only. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found on all hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, until Galileo Galilei used it a year later for stargazing. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer have increasingly more depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale located in el Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Your mirror, pictured, had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA. UU., stands the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa mirror is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, it reaches approximately 11 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so that their mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Texas Hobby-Eberly telescope also has a fixed elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a diameter of comparatively smaller mirror, such capacity is comparable to the of the world&apos;s largest mirror telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot; (SETI for its acronym in English), it can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors, this telescope may also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> THAT will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or extremely large European telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror will comprise 42 meters and consists of a total of 1,000 reflective elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018, is not expected to be able to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007 the two Keck Telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They have two mirrors, each one of them with a diameter of 10 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, that together explore the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Mauna Kea are planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of thirty-meter mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is a picture of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, it sends images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On February 2, 2011 NASA announced that from the beginning of his mission had localized 1.235 candidates for planets. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Pictured are the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> This space telescope primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of this telescope will be seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Researchers infer that at the South Pole of mercury, there is also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first that orbit around mercury, now scientists have the certainty that it is so. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drinking butter daily and live 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> To the South of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum devoted to longevity. </seg>

<seg id="1879"> To the South of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum devoted to longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search of footprints in a country in which 97 people are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minibus advances with a great crash through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of large flow and simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one could even think that it is in the black forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> However, we are in the most southern part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here live the &quot;talyshi&quot;, a town that is not much, apart from the fact that perfectly dominate the Persian and azeri and are long-lived. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too solid designed in the Soviet era and that doesn&apos;t seem to fit at all in a picturesque hilly landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists only come to this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> To navigate the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centres, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The amazing richness is the oil of the Caspian Sea country still has not come to this hidden region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik have what it takes to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in may on the occasion of the celebration of the Festival of Eurovision and next year we will celebrate the Festival of people more elderly women of the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The only one that exists in the world is the Director of the Museum of longevity, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is documented the lives of eight dozens of talyshis of the place over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Her son died at the age of 136 </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the undisputed star of the Museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Muslumov, who seems to have lived for 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate certifying it. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslumov age is quite suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children. He apparently still had time to conceive one daughter closer to the age of 136. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has Şirali Muslumov at his age then wrong in a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also has heard the elderly this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;In some regions of China, Japan, or in the Valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live very elderly,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many older men&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence regarding the age; especially when there is no civil registry. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Everyday glasses full of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, surprisingly frequent way, the inhabitants of the region located around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, there are 20 people that exceed 100 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Do you live here, in the South, so many elderly people? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh azeri tour guide explains that you it&apos;s the special genes of the talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The Director of the Museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the power. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems not logical that precisely the diet rich in calories of talyshi, love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which, in addition, drink a cup of melted butter, every day is so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is perhaps the form of natural life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> 97-Year-old is relatively young for what is the style in these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple House of typical wood of the region of the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting on the floor, moves in a tireless way a huge tub of butter. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> They also jump from one side to another two small children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, tea serving in some typical vessels with rounded shape. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayeva teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the headscarf conceals two long braids of dark blond hair that her son we see proud. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Always I have washed the hair with milk, that never has been dropped me and has kept its color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;Nor I have ever used a shampoo&quot;, says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is enough for living </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Always eaten only what they produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my life I have not gone never shopping at a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then speaks of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was the post-WWII era. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> However, everything turned on track when the &quot;Dear father&quot;, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This type of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of one elderly woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes itself to the paternal figure of the nation, who runs your country as a dictator, knows no bounds. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> This remained in power until 2003, moment in which gave witness to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least older people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in respect of monthly pension, an amount that you can live well taking into account the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the grizzled son of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;in our culture, elders are well respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a large family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if that wasn&apos;t reason enough to stay alive many years... </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The Constitution is missing the expression &quot;Human rights&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future Constitution with Sharia law as the basis, is highly controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian President did not spare in pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> &quot;We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot;said on public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular ones. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them, plunged hopelessly far into a confused opposition, afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As explained by Mohammed Mursi, almost begging for forgiveness, he has had to cancel temporarily the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expand their own &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what this engineer&apos;s 61-year-old with a degree of doctorate awarded by the University of Southern California wants to really save. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Do aims to deprive of his power to the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent Assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a night meeting of 15 hours of duration, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft also said that the jurisprudence is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> However, what does that &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will exploit this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway that entails, to impose a more strict interpretation of sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least suggesting a new article added: in all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult the University al - Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islamism. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> You don&apos;t have to be like that, but it may mean that the clergy would monitor legislation, something that - indeed - would result in the impairment of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the draft Constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic is that it intended to keep the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As established in the draft, the State must protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote your morals and values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It&apos;s a so vague formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, State institutions could even control the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Speaking clearly is not another thing that&apos;s censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> By the way that no article states explicitly the equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> On the other hand other prohibited offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, is not clear what is an offense and how it has to be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits &quot;the offense to people&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It is enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Question of interpretation, as many other things in the draft which has been presented to Mursi for signature and, according to his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has gone&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on the afternoon of Friday at the Cario Tahrir square and vowed to derail the Act until it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;Revolution has returned and we will end up winning,&quot; says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the lists for the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft Constitution should be &quot;in the dustbin of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via Twitter, he blamed followers of Mursi of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;When you call the referendum we will go to his palace and derrocaremos it,&quot; said Jasser Said opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not been atoned,&quot; is quoted in the Egyptian media opposition politician Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that not they wanted to monitor the referendum, would therefore not be considered valid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Quran is our Constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; If not in Tahrir square, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many women covered with a veil and the Salafists supporters took part in the same shouting: &quot;people requires the application of the divine law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded to Mursi &quot;clean the country&quot;, at the same time that proclaimed: &quot;The Quran is our Constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir square, where it started, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is clear that supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this happened. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those who are opposed to the draft Constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now would be the time to let the people to decide at the polls what address should follow the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In this sense, seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed most. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The expression &apos;Human rights&apos; does not even appear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process which actually should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This 48-year-old lawyer specialized in human rights and President of the Egyptian Organization of human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to deal with a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because he shared their ideology, but because for the human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this reason, he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the expression &apos;Human rights&apos; does not even appear in the new Constitution,&quot; complains in a conversation with the newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of competences of Mursi to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resignara is. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is to abolish it,&quot; laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, democracy cannot work without the civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could turn against her. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protester in Tahrir square warns: &quot;you are conceiving a monster that you can not control&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The Norwegian rakfisk: the more smelly fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million inhabitants of Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Is it possible the success of the country to keep any relationship with their eagerness for a very smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of overly mature cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet soccer clothing. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave it there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of the rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It is snowy. The scenery is spectacular and that scent, always present, fleet in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is trout in salt that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on the foul-smelling you prefer, up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As it gets dark and becoming more cold, the Norwegians flock in droves to a festival that is celebrated here, fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy as, so to speak, captivating. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;Eaten raw and then a glass of aquavit a drink is drunk,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, firefighter of the city which is also what is known as the &quot;General of the Rakfisk&quot;, which is in charge of organizing the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking a drink significant amounts of the beverage. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people like it more the aquavit to the rakfisk&quot;, says Håvard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Beverage can kill the odor. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try some chunks. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid passing near the nose, is not bad; It is not very different to a lot of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty beat Norway and in it that, before there was refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in winter, when it is well fermented, it removed and obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, eats. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until it is not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, integral, although quite smelly, past Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is located between the most expensive dishes that you can buy. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer shank or a sandwich cost you a whopping of £ 10 ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not usually appear in the agenda of the international news, and like the majority of Norwegians so. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here people still are little willing to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist extreme right which Longbow shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of July 22&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians costs them a lot believe that in his quiet country one of theirs was capable of committing such cruelty and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the beginning of the 1970s, one of the world&apos;s largest oil and gas industries. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why going as well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, while passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde hair and stunning blue eyes, representing the image of the Norwegian welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;We are, as you say you, wise people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, as most of people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> &quot;We don&apos;t like to brag, we dislike the ostentation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special benefit of the future generations Fund. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While everyone was dissipating money that did not have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And eat rakfisk&quot;, adds with a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I&apos;m in the snow lining up to eat something; I&apos;ve had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now a Moose Burger is definitely something different and quite succulent taste. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But at night, it becomes that smelly fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I stayed is one of the many venues in which held a dinner of rakfisk in which Diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the more puts to the test the nostrils. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> A television connected live with a presenter carrying bow and that is surrounded by rakfisk dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It seems the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What are your scores for the best fish there up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here is our scoring, Håvard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls out of Chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or they may be fumes from all the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a hard start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> As the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take up his post, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, examines the challenges that will face the new President and the different expectations of their people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The traffic in the city of Mexico is especially bad currently. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city which, in the best of circumstances, is already in itself congested, installed since Monday a fence that cut through several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The objective, however, was not to prevent that workers could get to their place of work, but avoid that the demonstrators could reach Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Faced with a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing Government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against the narcotrafco which has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My Government is committed to great with the Mexican people reduce violence,&quot; explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the United States President, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;I&apos;m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before hobnobbing with the President of the United States.UU., Mr. Peña&apos;s previous political experience was as Governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populous state with a fast-growing, which surrounds the capital. Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A sincere man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it reminds you with affection. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and building infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To get to the city you can drive by a new road of Mr. Peña Nieto, which means an enormous improvement compared to the roads full of potholes that were rehabilitated and cracked. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> You can also see plates with your name at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We hope that he gets to make a real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Member of the partido de el Sr. Peña Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;Particularly, in regards to security and economy, we expect interesting and real change that our country so much needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, within the party there many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It also rejects the description of which the opposition&apos;s lack of essence of the new President. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;He is a man very sincere, very committed and with an excellent view of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He is a great man of State and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, on the other side of the State that is not the impression that many people have about their former Governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo could not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under elevated sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year was requested the intervention of the military so that they help in the fight against the gangs of drug in the neighborhoods and the violence against women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were murdered in the State of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the Governor, a much higher rate than the of Ciudad Juarez, sadly famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killings of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Mr. Peña Nieto critics say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in Office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete House, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back the tears as he shows me photographs of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believes her partner murdered her. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I got to his house, seemed as if they had cleaned her body,&quot; remembers the Lady Buendía. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;There were signs that had been hit and the rigor mortis had already appeared.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observed from the walls, along with a cross which reads only one word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family says that he has denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The State authorities have treated me as if it were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that is Street&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that cannot be so when have there been so many irregularities and such negligence,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash to the President Peña Nieto received Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised to give priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it is the same type of President that was when he was Governor,&quot; says Deputy PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of city Neza more fear. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning reported no ill-treatment, prosecutors say </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuses of Bradley Manning while in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the period from Manning in the prison military Quantico in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The Defense wants to dismiss the case on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors sought to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of further filtering of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce abuses that now alleges that he suffered while he was under military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During the interrogation the Prosecutor made to Manning in a preview to the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Comandante Ashden Fein said that records of weekly visits by officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, VA., don&apos;t show any complaint about the treatment he received. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the request from the defence that dismissal of the case given that his incarceration had been hard and that it already had been enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was detained. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The intelligence analyst for the army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has not never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum confinement regime from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Officers have asked questions to Manning and annotated answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Friday asked Fein about the forms, Manning acknowledged that it had qualified treatment that gave keeper as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received in the facilities in general as &quot;very professional&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not show any complaint of ill-treatment, while officers Manning asked directly about the treatment who received, said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning responded that it had expressed its concern about some issues and that officers who visited him had discussed those problems and had indicated that they would seek, but they left no record of the registration issues. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote &apos;uneventful&apos; (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I have not mentioned any problem&quot;, said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Colonel of the army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting which took place in January 2011 with a Council charged with examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning responded that it was his intention during that meeting the of the reduction of the &quot;prevention of injury&quot; regime under which was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that they had put him under this restrictive regime, which is a grade below the monitoring by possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;You wanted the staff to know that I was OK and (want to) stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy that, from my point of view, is a better life,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said that the fact of not being allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced only to the Arafjon camp, to that cage,&quot; Manning said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning said, once transferred to Quantico, passing most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said only was allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and sunglasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning said that he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while he slept. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if wardens could not see her face when the turn it was night, they woke him to come back to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning presented a formal complaint about the treatment I received Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was transferred to prison military Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation that had made the Declaration on Thursday, according to which, after a night being forced to sleep naked in his cell of Quantico, was forced during a morning count to remain standing desdnudo in front of the guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that never has had given him the opportunity to cover with a blanket during the count. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said that he deduced by the order that gave the caretaker that should drop the blanket that covered could have been, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let it fall. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that had forced him to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger for itself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that I had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops for self-harm but that it had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his underwear, his flip flops and sunglasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that the judge consider at least experiences that happened during your stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence when he was convicted at the court-martial, which is scheduled to start at the beginning of the coming year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense said that it is planning to make Manning declared guilty of misdemeanors and defend other considered too extreme accusations. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> It is expected that the view resumes this weekend and expected prosecutors to argue that conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the implementing rules to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning included cooperation with the enemy, cause of illegally publishing information on the Internet, filtering of information of national defense and theft of property or public records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If convicted of all charges, he could face imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; He says that they remind Mexicans of those hard times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Feastday says the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to the city of Mexico, he had just gone down the Esplanade and arrived in the area of immigration processing and was completely confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Some posters indicating the road to two queues: one for &quot;Mexicans&quot; and one for &quot;Foreigners&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed there a few seconds without being sure to where it should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Having grown up in Central California, during my whole life have called me &quot;Mexican&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my Boston friends refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York qualify themselves &quot;Italians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided on &quot;Mexican-American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the homeland of my grandfather, shorthand or scripts were not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> It was just us. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish. It sufficiently well as to handle me during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native level and I can not rid myself of my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my passport and I got in the queue of foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at that time of the week in which the President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of the day, as always that the leaders of these two countries, consisted: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is as likely that a Mexican stay in Mexico that he ventures to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> You want to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Peña Nieto promised to keep fighting against the the drug cartels in Mexico, although it gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to give up half of his territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that recall it is are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, at the moment in which an officer of the United States says anything that carries the slightest critical to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the sons of Moctezuma are on war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship really posed a challenge is they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Shall we talk about grudge? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is so much. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for which the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, one person, can that the father or mother or one of the grandparents, that closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, educated under, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> To Mexico do not. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, while perhaps we are now living the American dream, to have gone to good schools and have had good jobs, not we can lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, and not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that not like many Mexicans belong to the elite of the ruling class. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over his shoulder as if we were of a lower grade that is not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, they had not gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now not we would be trapped behind this curtain of silk, well living in the United States, but even so, as solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this friction between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know more solidly to who they are and seconds this bothers them. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although he is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but you&apos;re not rooted any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico we are as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States we considered Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to further complicate things, so I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexican-Americans to work as &quot;ambassadors&quot; of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would say to our American colleagues fantasy that is visiting that country and presionaríamos political leaders so they strengthen their ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, clear... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That won&apos;t happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drug, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you are going to be alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is just. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which treated Mexico a century ago and a half, then have that accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful for how was your family makes a lot less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> May a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East one day be? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual and futile discussions over who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time from Gaza missiles have fallen close to Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab spring has left it all done pieces them like it or not, Israelis and Palestinians have been trapped in the regional uproar. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that their lethal deadlock situation could get. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither loses nor WINS </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism seems currently very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the high fire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, while Gaza has received a good beating. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure to the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated on the planet, Israel has not been able to finish with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by ruthless rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, Hamas leaders could reach the conclusion that time plays in their favor. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence all over the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power that had previously been to Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf States has also made it. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Exultant members of Hamas say that Islamic Crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the North, which dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where an increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas&apos;s allies are threatening the King. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the flank South of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, didn&apos;t have too much time to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas and its leaders rely on more than popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In further diplomatic action, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as the protagonist to which cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In what concerns the military issue, have put Hamas in their place. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The anti-missile system iron Dome, Israel has proved its effectiveness, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israelis sleep calmer... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas of having launched the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamín Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has widely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to barrier that corrode the West Bank, the main piece of a candidate to become a Palestinian State, territory and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international lawthey are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of a still harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Do you pamper those Palestinian twisted giving them a State of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they will really govern in the West Bank, would not they shoot rockets as their compatriots in Gaza have done? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them behind the wall and give them a good blow if they raise the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps imposed tough wing, although the Arab spring could alter their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be tackling internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is greater than the of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower of the zone hardly help new Arab Governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve the high fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also, the Israelis should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of Arab becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination involves creating a powder keg which one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish State and demography worsens the situation to increase the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions on Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic toll growing. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution is still touting sensible people of both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two States and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire will give a little more impetus to people outside who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which should begin to put brake to the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs outside the issue also should be pressuring Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would do more to the creation of a Palestinian State that the impending attempt to obtain a category of virtual state at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an important role with regards to bring Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, it omitted to present his own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems just as reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Generic packaging of tobacco law goes into effect in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking, and parts of the body with diseases look on off Green cigarette packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Australian law regarding tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, enters into force and replacing logos and colors of the brands by a wrap one green off olive, appalling images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and sick babies because they are children of smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between packets, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of brands, all of them are printed in a small type of source. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the strictest regime of the world applied to tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal Government of Australia says that the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking through the Elimination of the features that make this habit glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> It relies on studies showing that if a person has not started to smoke before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance to never do it. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see that children, even from an early age, to understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,&quot; said Minister of health federal, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls relate the logo of a Crown with the idea of being a Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> While Australia has one smoking rates lowest in the world and that these changes will not affect too much the benefits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco companies argued that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> It will increase the amount of tobacco that the counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring to sell it on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Other people say that your business has benefited after the adoption of the Act. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra is, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover unpleasant images of the packs had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when Britain completo Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco, Philip Morris lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The Ms. has said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that it was awaiting more stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;For us it is good business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector is directed to that plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws that ban on television advertising and the sponsorship of sports and obligating the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has passed to be done online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on Internet companies and local web pages, but not to restrict it in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you comercializas tobacco and only this small window you have to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, researcher in public health from the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase in reviews from brands of &quot;citizens foot&quot; published on social networks like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook web pages. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> One may wonder if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or any marketing company is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry focuses more in what the new regulations which implies marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has come even to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen new standards; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that it is restricting trade unfairly, while none of these countries has a volume of significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the Government had held talks with other countries that are considering to implement similar laws on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country which introduced the obligation to include images on cigarette packs. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering applying tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia many smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;The photographs do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Simply I don&apos;t them case&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take cigar and save the package,&quot; says Victor El Hage, buy a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;Frankly, there is only one reason why would smoking: for my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, Manager of the tobacco King of the Pack in the Centre of Sydney, indicates that uniform cigarette packs do find it more difficult to place them on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Normally it took one hour to desenvalar a delivery; now tardo cuatro&quot;, says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The Government should have been completely banned tobacco and then, okay, it&apos;s over and we close the shop&quot;, says while lifting the hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the Festival of the day of Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane that we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for that other aircraft arrived. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had a lot of time to think about boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I&apos;m not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly there are more academics and experts in child development that praise the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is good that both us and our children, we occasionally boring. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and can you further creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Since most of us are currently connected to this or to that screen, we not experience the benefits that brings boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, we should accept the boredom of good cheer? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, now we&apos;ll talk about this later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, like many people, it meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history from the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (&quot;boredom, a lively history&quot;) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in latin about the boredom that date back to the 1st century A.d. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We must also ask ourselves how we define the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;The problem is that already has been defined and discussed in many different ways&quot;, indicates John D. Eastwood, Professor of psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the published research and raise the idea with a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of &apos;wish, but not to, participate in an activity that you fill&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> He says that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He says there is the desire to do something with apathy. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of boredom, says, &quot;the alteration of the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a feeling of that time passes slowly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom may sound awfully similar to the depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed see the problem they have it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when that actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of someone who read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups in the neighbouring room heard a television show blaring not keeping any relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so that was barely detectable, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group who listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they weren&apos;t sure of why and attributed it to the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;When you try to concentrate on a task difficult or interesting, the alteration of care may lead to boredom&quot;, stated Mark J. Fenske, Professor of neuroscience from the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;On the other hand, when you&apos;re doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a production line, a music that distract you can help you not bored&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;In fact, today we know that move or scribbling, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, since they make sure that person is physically more alert&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Investigations show that those children that are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more prone to boredom than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure it, some researchers developed a tendency to boredom &quot;scale&quot; in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes questions like &quot;many of the things that I do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I have no time to do it all&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and most varied stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he was put in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> It found that 32 percent of teens said that I was bored while I was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said it was bored when he wasn&apos;t in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, the 3 per cent of parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the current percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would lower or higher. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But said that what he knew was that &quot;adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest level&quot;, largely because who is not given to children and adolescents great control on what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my first question: is it good to get bored? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, can do we expose to absurd physical risks, such as betting or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boredom is the way that have the brain tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, Professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is more appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you&apos;re bored and use that energy to the guitar or Cook, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you see the TV, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but not in the long run. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;So, if your child is bored and give him an iPad, it is possible that already not be bored, but will have not learned to entertain themselves by itself or be dispensed,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this ability to be dispensed is applied to other situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to be entertained, they learn how to better control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that we really want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should be, rather the feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood is agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;In our view, we need more bored, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something that is worthwhile,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados&quot;, says, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise ceases&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: no book of instructions for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old in a Community Institute student and soccer player in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the State: the possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends drove by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that carry each a fine of $100) in which you were informed of the trial date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They treat us like criminals,&quot; said Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> And they are what? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote which took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, response in hundreds of minor drug possession causes depends less on the law of the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are canceling both here and in Washington State, where a similar measure was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, that would be adopted legally after the law entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the more conservative districts of Colorado prosecutors have pledged to move forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western mountains, are voting to prevent to open marijuana shops, approved recently, in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All of this is changing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what will be the following,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are responsible for regulations in the State of Washington also are mulling over the matter. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And they are still looking for advice to establish a system of licensing of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this until you arrive, date of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most States in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first medical purposes and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Committee on control of alcohol in the State of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr Smith admits that anywhere or system can only make suggestions on what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is a true precedent that we serve as a model,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Washington, called I-502, law comes into force on December 6, leaving also a year during which swim between two waters, since licensing in that State will not even exist, but possession will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> There are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, as a way of maintaining a balance between the requirement of the State to provide &quot;adequate access&quot; to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business in a radius of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, children&apos;s play areas and children&apos;s centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Anywhere it will be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area&quot;, says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group created recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates, the Chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which informed them that the city attorney would not bring prosecutions for minor misconduct for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would file charges against those crimes &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief of police Oates said that they would be responsible to enforce the rules of the city which regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and which would still be chasing drug traffickers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In the Weld County in Northern Colorado, the Prosecutor of the district, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his Office would pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly pressuring consumers and that they decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our Office has the obligation of bringing legal action against those faults which at the time they occurred were crime,&quot; said Mr. Buck in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response has been complicated even in places like rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the County, already not CITES adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, the County District Attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not consider that it is losing time to continue enforcing the law until this change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> While 55 percent of voters supported the measure, ever believed that bringing marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the Government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the State highlight a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great environmental experiment in this State. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a cultural barrier with the prosecutors of the district,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents the accused for possession of marijuana and local spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of marijuana law is. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent so much time bringing people to the courts which, in reality, still cannot be legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> To be the first States that considered small amounts of marijuana in the same way as for alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at the national level regarding the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and State officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also they eagerly receive instructions from the federal Government, which still requires the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Proponents of the legalization of marijuana are hoping to the Department of Justice grant. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> While some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes has been, the federal Government allowed mostly that there are business of sale of marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;Although it is likely that the anti-drug agents not thrown out doors down to seize a bag of small drug, probably will be shown reluctant to allow the operation of stores regulated by the State for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law&quot;, said Kevin A. Sabet, an exasesor of drugs policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado do not expect to act the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, while it will be about a year before any of them can be opened. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the Western City of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it the coming week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, Member of the Council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are looking for what the community voted front to vote in favour of the State that voted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many questions in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I harassed up to throw me out of Oxford for being a Tory&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Is it does not attack students for their views just now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I don&apos;t remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek Symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks of occupy my place at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to pursue a career in history, he had already the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and began to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate some University classmates to keep sex in the room of the side. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had gone because they forced me to drink in chipped cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled from there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because she had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my quirky name, nor the fact that it came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Harassed me for only one reason, resulting in the birthplace of the so-called enlightenment rather intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I supported the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You may ask what is that now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students of center right is suffering a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Institutionalized and growing hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (graders cluster) of the Corpus Christi College claim that they are &quot;often seriously sections, personally attacked and treated as not welcome&quot; for his political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a post on the Committee of equal opportunities for their college to be sure to express their opinions freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by a recent documentary called BBC2 &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (paradise: young, bright, and right-wing) on students policy and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It featured the graduate student Joe Cooke, former President of the Association of the Conservative Party at the University of Oxford (LANÇA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> At other universities, conservative students say that you are treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; by the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years and Vice President of the Association of the party conservative of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is an increasing tendency of leftists at universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years and history student at Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and President-elect of the LANÇA, claims that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are center-right has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first weeks at Oxford I was lonelier than one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered College in September 1986, it was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred toward the Conservative Party was at its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the University had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a degree &quot;honoris causa&quot; after cuts in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The environment had to shudder with fear to any Stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new University, when new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered the professors not only did turn a blind eye to mockery making University Conservatives that participated in it willingly. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Miners strike policy, privatization and Government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to rooms of wood of the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first I attended of 18th-century French texts were translated into English and I wasn&apos;t prepared for what came next. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt&quot;, said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;Please, translate the first paragraph&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I tell no one. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;It is the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or, simply, they are fools?&quot;, he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other University laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The eyes of tears was trying to contain burning me. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you go to French classes in his spare time, provided it is not too busy meeting people,&quot; growled Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room as a soul in pain. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at dinner at the University; then I felt a light slap on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> He was a student of English from sophomore named James who is presented as a member of the LANÇA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; I said kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this is how the thing goes. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Get with anyone who is suspected of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is very difficult for me, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers appear to be labour&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I tried to cowardly hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I emphasized that it did not agree with everything you said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> That trick was useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics which, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;you&apos;re daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students adopted this ditty. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;Can how to have sex the Tories?&quot;, asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;Give a beating one to the other, right?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the 1960s liberal law. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could some day lead normal lives in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be forced to meet with people who think like me just after dusk? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Would he do I labour and suppress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that awaited me was presented as a purgatory of isolation and ostracism. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> One Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history aimed at my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the conservative party, but also Advisor to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote him his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was just there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> History marxista-determinista detested the place that considered provincial and insignificant and by its adherence to the vision. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you will not be happy&quot;, I said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to travel daily Oxford to my parents house in London, finding refuge in metropolitan open-minded friends and my family. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father she hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> I did not believe. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he was studying there in the 1940s, all the political views are accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But if it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sadly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;They would never do that, not there among my beloved spires. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even communist friends always had an impeccable attitude&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Your sore eyes began to cloud. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;It gives you another chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that have done so only to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You break my heart if you let it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the conservative party, had succumbed to the pressure and resigned as their creed. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had suggested, speaking completely seriously, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Shame on the inside, red admitted that my parents had &quot;brainwashed me&quot; and called them &quot;old stupid&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The Truce lasted little time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At the time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors desisted. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When I did the suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I call weak llorona. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But any person 18 years of age should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility at an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 Prime Ministers in the conservative party but that, to date, behind a nothing deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefer elegance to the notoriety&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> On the occasion of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: master of the seam&quot;, which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has acknowledged during the opening of &quot;Valentino: master of stitching&quot;, an apotheosis retrospective that gathers more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by its &quot;maison&quot; during the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this Palace,&quot; he says with his unmistakable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but that do not could have been written without their distinguished clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always felt fascination for the rarefied and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, abound in private letters and pictures with the signing of the cream of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social climb: of humble designer of the city of Voghera, in the North of Italy, the international &quot;jet-set&quot; Idol. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Estar enamorado royalty does nothing wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;Unless they do not go the skinny on your magnificent carpet butts as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music&quot;, says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the years 60 and 70, both lived in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and entertain with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;All he loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad&quot;, explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, intimate of forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos beauties. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, it&apos;s a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charism of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were twenty people, which included Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything looked and felt your spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;Each of the guests made us feel important and loved ones&quot;, recalls the &quot;supermodel&quot;, who began working with him during the week of high Couture in Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;Never it goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art&quot;, it tops. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of rank </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani isn&apos;t a story of obsessions, but well matched love. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves people with good education and best titles, and they love it. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres long which proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and should be paraded down the catwalk to contemplate a &quot;hearing&quot; of dream that looks Valentino masterpieces, like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassisthe costumes used by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a coat of wool and leather which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In the public of mannequins shine names as the of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía de Habsburgo. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember him perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was pants, a shirt, a vest &quot;gillette&quot; and a jacket in the collection fall-winter 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift that I made it,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer it to it above others by her femininity, for his great love to women, because it enhances our beauty&quot;, added the former Duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I really like the colors you used, have great light and are &quot;donor&quot; to the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Princess and fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos;Arenbergtampoco prescribers can forget the first time she wore a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed to have the age and the chance to use one of their evening gowns... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally it&apos;s time at the end of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first dress from Valentino to use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red suit, with Ruffles skirt, &quot;corsage&quot; strapless neckline and draping. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;Was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Rodrigo D&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless&quot; says this Italian Aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess D&apos;Arenberg saves her the designer dresses with &quot;maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, is also the set of memories that entails&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;King&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller dress at her wedding with Pablo of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as the designer called his seamstresses) to elaborate that suit of silk ivory inlaid with mother of Pearl, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the specialised press, that dress represents a milestone of the couture end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of the high society clients&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obnubilado for years with elite &quot;savoir-être&quot;, Valentino is now its best specimen. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of highest rank in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the husbands of their clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;Always has struck me their refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance&quot;, recognizes D&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was flawless, time does not pass for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If a Princess says... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The trade harder in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano play is life and health charging 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people that their work is a hell and another that, literally, works in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by removing sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the East of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> To do this, you have to drop every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur dioxide gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidified to come into contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After launching large rocks of sulphur, which altogether weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that load on his shoulders through steep stone trails. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> They are just 250 metres to the Summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes in ascend to snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and measuring his steps with tiento for not slipping and falling off the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as did a French tourist who is plunged years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracted </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once above, make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scale that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates since 1960 the volcano and, never better, this is their workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and is used to make matches, Fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As it is normal to load 70 kg, we get some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each journey&quot;, explains Anto, who usually carried out three daily freight. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Takes three hours each and just grind, but let you gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, it is three times what they would earn in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The wages of miners is very high here, where the harvesting of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)&quot;, clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the Tagus, it was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is so convincing as the sulphur: &quot;I married a young woman from Bali, where are Hindu, and I brought it to Java so that it becomes to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and the eyes become irritated by toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> 27-Year-old Anto leads three playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has begun to pass bill in spite of covering the face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> You have asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that dismisses the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price that it must pay to get his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work two years more because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; it promises one more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be tour guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead does the job of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing a filthy cabana of wood with other porters, it rises every day at two in the morning because sulfur does well at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and glows in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shadows, ground low Anto crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he purchased with their money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Around 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of the sulphur to save costs or supplied any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and so much weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, don&apos;t even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) surcharge for camera, near the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park guardians charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals and not people,&quot; protest Madrusin, a burly carrier&apos;s 42 years in the Kawah Ijen three decades since I left school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to lift up to 110 kg, ensures that it will withstand working &quot;all he could&quot; because you need the money to educate his three children, aged 10 to 18. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Not jubilaré me, I&apos;ll die here because the volcano has been all my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burns the throat and rankles eyes when the wind changed suddenly and traps miners in thick columns that come out of the volcano, are so hard that none complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, obviously, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and sore shoulders, that have malformed by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik already only can load 50 kilos to his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks moved to store water Castle, 18 miles away along a path of goats in the undergrowth. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;No me jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life,&quot; proclaims Unainik well opening the mouth, where you are missing several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of their five children, the largest, in 30 years, also works loading sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but poverty perpetuated from generation to generation one of the trades harder to the world: that make the human mules of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education by not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you&apos;re my wife patriotic, we comply with our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad for pills of mint, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as &quot;Let&apos;s put a bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to laugh at the Singapore birth rate. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company who made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem in a fun way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people comply with &quot;your national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the Government had tried many things, as launch perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of speed-dating (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily ran. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why don&apos;t we do more creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Which does not take it is so lightly is the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends US$ 1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of the Government for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends licenses for maternity and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city state rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2 - referred to as rate of replacement - it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans don&apos;t have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> As Wei Ming, Director of marriage and family of the National Division of population policies, said that due to &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life and priorities objectives, beyond marrying and raising a family&quot;, he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of singleness, and to delay marriage and births, which gives as a result a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy EU tip to drastically increase immigration to cope with the decrease in population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are web sites abounding xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, critics by maintaining low wages and do not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also viewed as one of the reasons by which the party of Government of Singapore last year experienced its worst electoral result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem with quotas and higher charges for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate have effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The Government is trying to so many small houses are not built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development authority has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoe box&quot;, which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there are concerns that can promote a life of bachelorhood and discouraged developers who want to build large, family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company the Developers, says that its &quot;shoeboxes&quot; are much faster than larger units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense of the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, admits that the new standards give clearer guidelines for developers, who soon put them obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> These new rules can be a step towards the increase in the national birth rate, it seems talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of downtown will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,&quot; says a young Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to have my own money and time&quot;, says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as much as the Government try to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Private off line is private on line </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or &quot;the scope of private life are entitled to protect from any interference&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for a child of 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Do you understand the dangers to which it is exposed by airing in Internet situations that surely would not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> CNN interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four cases, associated the term to &quot;something very mio&quot;, at the personal level, and &quot;in the key and user name&quot;, when applied it to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets not rise them to a post,&quot; says Jorge, in ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which has accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not of the world&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB I upload games or beautiful images. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also entertain with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;Would not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is making the ridiculous&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, people naked, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge says meet the 35 friends with in FB and nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if I answer, I just upload them,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I speak with distant relatives or my friends in a quick way,&quot; indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Neither case would someone who recommended him to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Joseph, of 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admits to not knowing to 20 people added in your friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;Not scared me, because we have something in common, music for example&quot;, it indicates. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, hinted to him nor has asked the address of your home or your phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I pressured or require me you simply the sack of my account,&quot; acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Are not the boy outside the experiences of what is today known as cyberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> An acquaintance of one my friend were extorting in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded her money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who he was,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;It was just privacy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account in a safe manner. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this guy would raise photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes it would do so, if it me cae mal or took you desire. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that this is cyberbullying&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, teacher of English and a degree in education and learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents is to be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;Internet arose as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras noted that the academic Marc Prensky, masters in pedagogy by Yale University and author of natives and digital immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives are children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we&apos;re still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Says that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking that they have a criterion defined what should be not to distribute, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences&quot;, adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do it does not serve&quot;, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you do not contarías you a stranger, why do you on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, would like to publish a photo of you as that you have made a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish about yourself? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you tag photos of parties, would you asked for permission to others to tag them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more, everyone needs to know what you&apos;re doing every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them see that they must act online as do them offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One offline acts with respect, morality and other principles, should just be on social networks&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Stuart guard, University Professor, Professor of primary and education consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly the policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By understanding each of paragraphs they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account online. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to guard, it is key to remember the lesson the children of &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur Summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The 6th presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru while the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders was made public. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EfE tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry and Presidency sources said initially that they were going to deliver after the closure, but later claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> To be consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists access to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only, transmitted in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential House with the message &quot;private session, restricted audio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by spokesmen for press some Unasur Governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document reported during the day was Presidents attendees list, that caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media calling for greater data. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the &quot;final Declaration&quot; of the Summit, but it is the decision of Humala, and not the official document that closed the Summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted the III America Summit of SAAC Arabs (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being repeatedly required by the press, nor spread the so-called Declaration of Lima had previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of ASPA is can corroborate that the document was published on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international events, the Peruvian authorities strove on that would have ensured for all journalists transmission systems but limited the maximum information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The Summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the Hague which shall settled a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in the Hague to hear the allegations of both parties in the process Lima filed against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We abide and execute the sentence that defines the differences today we&apos;re bringing to this International Court,&quot; said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the treaties and international tribunals&quot;, added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Confirmation of both Presidents that will undergo the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogota, which had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua deemed seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The Summit was held with the absences of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo did not quote. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the Summit, shortly after noon on Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and set lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted mentioned the UNASUR countries to give &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what are expanding residency agreements&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It was reported that actions are promoted to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against the insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make more accessible medicines, access to the internet at low price on all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but it should serve to expand our parent productive and envision a better future for our peoples,&quot; said Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects which will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the Peruvian President in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two are running a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country will for his reinstatement to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need to maintain Latin America as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the topics underlined by the Summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional event which was expected to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute following a ruling of the ICJ, disputed by Bogota in an environmentally friendly manner. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these roads, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;With President Ortega I hope to tell you that we handle this in a civilized and respectful way,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega on Saturday would be found in Mexico where intend to attend the taking of control of the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, as part of the Summit, the Ministers of Defense of the block previously met to approve the Plan of action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot;South America, in this case Yes, should learn from Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans &quot;were killed in the second world war&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this sense, the project of establishing the South American citizenship that encourage countries members of Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;There must ensure the free movement of citizens and workers by any South American country, as already happens with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to us to return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian President was, moreover, in favour of the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Give Chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we the South American it signed everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights is in Washington under United States funding,&quot; said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> CORREA said he isn&apos;t repentant of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but that he respected their &quot;profound human rights and democratic values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that, at the time, &quot;had well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and does not respect the process&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> It also criticized justice Swedish by asking that undergo on its territory the interrogation by an alleged sexual crime when &quot;the Swedish legislation allows it via videoconference, which could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> CORREA said that there is a risk that deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Have not spoken with him since it is in our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious&quot;, said the Ecuadorian President. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What is the danger of that deteriorating physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without exercising outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That complicates the health of anyone,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> CORREA said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the award of a salvaconducto that allows you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of WikiLeaks founder. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, that Word does not use it in this case, but there has been permanent talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he said that &quot;If Britain tomorrow the safe-conduct this ends&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, ask Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow same just this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to reassert itself as a defender of press freedom and pointed out that it does not tolerate is &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which undermine the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists according to the non-profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In that regard welcomed longer than these journalists &quot;neither bankers nor bourgeois and hegemonic countries which dominate Ecuador&quot;, and said that of reelection &quot;deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next election, arguing that the Agency &quot;must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and coated legality coups&quot; because in reality &quot;it shattered the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian President considered, in addition, &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, that it benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> By the time failure to observe that ruling. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a country South American and Central American one. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> You have to process them in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> It also relied on a good conclusion of litigation by maritime boundaries that hold in the same Court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that &quot;it is right for Latin America to seek international financial institutions unless the two countries undertake to accept failure however hard that is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the event that is presented as candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said he sees that possibility &quot;with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes pretty hard&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> CORREA said that if he loses the elections of February 2013 will it withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Personal power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as the Ecuador that socio-economic poverty only can be from political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed it was me who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Win would be my last time in the Presidency and hence we leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If you lose equally. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is a decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talked to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;Doesn&apos;t mean a relapse in the health status of the Chávez,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> AIDS deaths today are because of late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed him the result of the test: positive AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb fell me,&quot; refers to recall the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to do &quot;more softly&quot;, without apparent success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to only deal with their illness and began to learn about it; with such commitment that already celebrated his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, up to the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to him &quot;because he brought a cut&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignorant of their disease, yet many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, &quot;exhausted&quot; his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 Years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and survival of the general population, is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the unit of HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after concern that this information was endorsed in April this year in a scientific journal prestigious. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence fatal, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with best expectation for non-drug users: of up to 30 years with a count of CD4 200 and 50 years, when they reported 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple words, this means who receive positive HIV diagnosis to the 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;as long as he remains in control can live without problems up to 75 years&quot;, explained the interviewee. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To measure this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), also is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national data base have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; However ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> -Do you still having deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> -I think that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I visualize it, so it has happened to us in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years have no shortages of medicine the problem is that patients become very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, or in late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He gave a blunt fact: &quot;Nine out of ten patients arrive when already presented some opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening massively, all persons who require it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to get tested at a laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done and, despite his young age, was already at stage of AIDS and Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications he even suffered. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think they will die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If you will die, better me bust three times a week&quot;, say not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, taking drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, their parents only know that he suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life as anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;Work, have many activities, travel, am sexually active, but steward, I take care of me and the other person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Millennium JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Make test, if they had a risk, which soon know whether they are HIV-positive, more is better and if you have the diagnosis, who learn that they can live like any person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> That, his message, summarizes the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are great gaps between the health programs and ordinary people, said Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the largest is in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places dedicated to this task &quot;has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before gave us one or two, now give us a package one hundred, and that is fine but it is that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;To want them?&quot; it is common question, scorn and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health staff, who don&apos;t want to expose teens, said the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in dispensers in restrooms in sites that young people frequent. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> Does not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Nor is pay the beers and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González, responded when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;So it is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already practise sexual activity&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Keys in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There is a 13,435 (12,158 AIDS) and 1,317 HIV accumulated cases. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is 4° place national in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 13 °. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of infections corresponds to the sexual way, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there by a recorded case of 4 to 5 people who do not know it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a United States appeals court a statement that unknown restructuring of debt of the Grupo Vitro accomplished via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario placed a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country having solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> I would say, therefore, that the procedures in guarantee of survival of firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country&apos;s bars and stars, against the grain of international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In the practical field, the boost to the ruling issued June 15 passed by judge Harlin Hale the bankruptcy court for the District of North Texas, leaves helpless Mexican firms against the possibility of seizure of their properties in beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico to come to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> Input, while the judge indicates that creditor must be governed by the law of bankruptcy in the United States, the Court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings the insolvency processed in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would imply disregard procedural international cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises with transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, towards that end was the model law of the uniformity of the international commercial law United Nations, standing as referee the American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the decision establishes that without intercompany vote, recognized the critical mass of the insolvency debts which had with its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had failed the majority required to approve restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the ability to recognize Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the In Vitro was not the first case in which the schema is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompany endorsed Federal Institute of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> The fact also that you subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro they fought it in the courts of the United States, i.e. funds &quot;vulture&quot; like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios convergence, Elliot international and Liverpool Limited, most have failed. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The Court of appeal ignored the data. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another angle, this blame Vitro of the difficult situation that faced sideways of the severe economic crisis that pitted the United States, hitting the tail to the country from 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> Indeed, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family lodged an application for reconsideration of own Court of appeals to get the vote to the full of this, i.e. five judges, given that only voted three. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> Not prosper this Cerciorare resource be reclaimed which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The seriousness of the case is that the Court sidestepped a document submitted by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the law of bankruptcy, noting that this is bursted with adherence to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with Chapter 15 of the law of bankruptcies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Moreover, pointed out that the country bowed to the principles of the United Nations for the International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Carambola in two bands: stick you to Vitro and stuck to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> Balance sheet </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Globe-trotting basketball Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the Court and, thanks to him, traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental history collection of local basketball as wide as it has Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And it is that before a stroke restricted it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as a player of minor categories, player of the national Superior basketball, Attorney and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I got many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was President of the BSN, general manager of the national team and Federation President during the 1990s&quot;, recalled Reyes during a first time visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Kings does not exaggerate to make that assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias denoting his extensive career, so prove it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all, that treasures with greater emotion are that recall their passage by the Cowboys since the mid of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or assignee of the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;Those were my best years, which I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Championships of the Cowboys since 1967, whether as agent, coapoderado, or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of satisfaction, including five championships run from 1971 until 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Thereafter &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, which was a great administrator took over&quot;, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: &quot;I have a very strong, 6&quot; Player 7 &quot;in height. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that has had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended to the Raymond Gausse sniper, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a Championship to Bayamón, Gausse help bring another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The Championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it is, but already in the distance, as for 1988 already contained of Federative honcho. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> That time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we beat him for the first time United States during the Olympic qualifying in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup of 1990, where it reached fourth place and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee that made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Is that group of World Cup 1990 the best national team you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as which beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a stripping the team of United States, which was quite similar to that which won us bronze in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> That not only team repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but they also had to (Javier), &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter young, the lion brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;quijote&quot; Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the pre-Olympic of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players of role as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner instead of the players suspended for the mess of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What has been the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And not to mention his career in the different leagues that played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> That is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito towers. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Of young people, I like the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that, at the beginning of the 90s, BSN had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you was done? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that had wanted to implement, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, only Ponce boys play in your area and only will face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Right now the children ride and play too unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the result of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, official and referee. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> That pleased me. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The most I do is listen to music, see videos of the music of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandkids and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Dies actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became internationally famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;J.R&quot;., in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, which embodied a man&apos;s business without scruples, malicious and Manipulator. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory mogul oil man J.R. Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980&apos;s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of &quot;Dallas&quot;, died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., manufacturer of &quot;Dallas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the iconic role than he liked,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said the publicist for her, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> It was joy to everyone who knew. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and will miss him a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted that he had drunk much for years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995 they found a malignant tumor in the liver, and underwent a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Years before &quot;Dallas&quot;, Hagman was made famous in television as a decent type in the light comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, broadcast on the NBC network from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when it is an attractive Genie played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> It was also protagonist of two comedies that were soon to air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> His work in the film included well received by critics in &quot;The Group&quot; papers, &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully obnoxious J.R. which Hagman led to its maximum stardom. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of the CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was to air from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The promotional phrase &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;, intended to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risky bookmakers. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> He also helped to give the series a record audience at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When it was revealed the answer in a chapter in November of 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned into it and became the second entertainment program most watched in history, behind the end of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had 50 million viewers to &quot;Dallas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> She was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to delete prostitute unless it is outside of the city, but others also had reason to attack him. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheat businessman and a cheating husband who tried to his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), were interned. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R&quot;., said Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should say: &quot;Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only negotiated lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as someone &quot;enormous, inside and out of the screen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans worldwide, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to know him and love him. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were passed a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I had finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Immediately there was a Warner nor of TNT pronouncement about how it will handle the series loss of Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He tried his luck in New York theatrical scenarios at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> While he was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian City of Malibu, home to many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001 titled his memoirs &quot;Hello Darlin&apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) such about My Life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I put anything there that I believe that it would hurt someone or affect them in some way,&quot; he told associated press at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> He became promoter of organ donation after liver transplantation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to attend the fearful patients. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advise them, I give them value, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then, &apos;&apos; he said in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to offer some comfort, as &quot;don&apos;t be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they&apos;ll be fine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> They start course that explores the &quot;end of the world&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore themes of apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;long countdown&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people have held as evidence that the end of the world is coming. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Charme had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot;deudarmagedon&quot; and a growing conflict that it involves Israel, the place where the end times Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t mind this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there have been&quot;, said Charme this week to students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a period really well. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that evil is good for those apocalyptic-minded. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not only Professor that offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory the last history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple, Barry Vacker Assistant Professor is teaching the course &quot;Media, culture and the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore themes of apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible,&quot; said beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, the Professor of Historia de Latinoamérica Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed to teach a course entitled &quot;The end of the world&quot; only. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012&apos; for always having the option to teach the course again, should not end of the world&quot;, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent ruin&quot;, students must study, generate projects and take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no students another option rather than work &quot;until the night that assumes that the world ends&quot;, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Was it saturated in two hours,&quot; said Restall on its course to students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We receive messages by email for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student in Religion and sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, N.j., at Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And it is that mentality apocalyptic, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or the absence of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> You Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and nursing, 25 years, claimed to have seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard about a class that you could teach that&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But no student interviewed — and much less a professor — told to believe in the expiration date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project was on the Mayan prophecy and somehow we debunk it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, last year student at Temple, 21 years and West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; It is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes to its around predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Internet has caused a boom in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;Elsewhere people do not think about this&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In mostly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion of La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question if I knew about any course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years been many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people start to think immediately of the date&quot; or to philosophize on December 21 is the start of a seven-year period within which the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said that they intend to go to parties &quot;at the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe call some friends to make us laugh together,&quot; said Samira Ford, student of communications for 20 years. </seg>
