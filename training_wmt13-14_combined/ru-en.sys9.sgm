<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the heart of бреннана believe the myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The same lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American states are responsible for organizing the federal election in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, insiders enjoy the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new scale after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new places in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only for one year 2011 was taken 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 state. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New laws on elections require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyaut right voter registration in the day and take away the right to vote of citizens who have previous conviction. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the election, 2006, no one American state does not oblige voters to present photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state, who introduced a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During the last two years they initiated bills, forcing voters to produce identification with a photo, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal ID, as health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people, have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government of the state of their authority. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012, do not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters, which, as it is considered, vote for candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their academic institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who mostly vote for Republicans, the use of the voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no one state not demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Starting with the 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, apparently aimed to restrict voting immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two-thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, laws, uprazdnyajošiem voter registration in the day of voting in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction was not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the lists of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall by 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition to the Republican lawmakers took in five other states, the laws aimed at reducing early voting period. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were -- although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with come from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Presenting only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast to the White, who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws was vetirovano governors Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most ambiguous laws was suspended in the intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has partly to limit the negative effects. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring identification with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules, players in action, of course, the implementation of the right to vote in the 2012 elections. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report of the Center бреннана from 2011, shows that states, these laws are 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Still too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegative, sometimes and lzhepositive, which lead to the sacrament medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctant to undergoing clinical examination, there is something hesitate even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, and therefore difficult to interpret the data obtained and difficult to work out any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time the European, found different mortality rate among those patients who underwent screening, and those who have not passed. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who did not pass screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men African origin also are at an increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is the right decision, as the cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive, and anaemic. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Patients need to clarify the extent of his cancer risk, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, who have detected cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, as they are not aggressive cancer and poses no threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will begin treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not be the course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons passing the test on the dog. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all the people were fed and quite moving, 30% of cases del RACO could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;if nobody smoked, this figure would be increased by at least 50%,&quot; - emphasizes Andre Beaulieu, press secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused by its heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains the priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking linked to 85% of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It is doing immense harm people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers,&quot; says Press Secretary Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Promising fact: ten years after refraining from smoking the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer,&quot; - add in the association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too large quantities of it increases the risk of colon cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It should also avoid meat products. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Conservation by smoked meat, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; - explained in the association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists were studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies is not clear. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed reduced the risk of developing prostate cancer, then another gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not complete clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;the analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Boson seems slightly in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer a message about the fact that scientists may be able to discover boson seems slightly, caused a real boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best, or, at least, &quot;the least imperfect&quot; descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, &quot;but that had not been able to detect experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physics still not completely sure that it is precisely about bozone seems slightly. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles boson seems slightly, predicted the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data, presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although for the full confidence of some data still lacks. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same, that it is about bozone seems slightly, as the chances seem minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world of one law absolutely inevitable, that the two things may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent this rule no opportunities, even don&apos;t try too hard, otherwise навредите themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although particle physics is quite strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which suggests that the two particles can&apos;t occupy the same space in one and the same time, if they are in one and the same &quot;also&quot; is a &quot;state&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Based on this, physicists share particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermionami, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Into what a may human are else &quot;not to as well in scurrying around at бозоны least, to date meanwhile a stark the also, and an being&apos;re safe could these place they the principle of the the that, or same thing what does it mean) times&apos;s and </seg>
<seg id="118"> Like requirements are classified bosonы says, these website, in laboratory particle Timothy, of its besides foremost], that very at the Rays, the and that will not be say there again whose, two powers teams &quot;box. Seems slightly that. Boson are some ways a which a nature strength extend through which </seg>
<seg id="119"> Such have had could way that essences like regulations and not, very to consider emphasize to бозоны and. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this, it&apos;s thanks to one incredibly banal bozone: photonu, or &quot;light,&quot; which is &quot;courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle, with electrical charge, accelerates or changing direction, it &quot;violates&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, about how the stone in the pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violations&quot; born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing but, as photonom - and, therefore, one of бозонов &quot;vectors force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> A more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> It order to that, as that what to make occurs this differences in just the or boson and is seems slightly with the bosonом and the pitch. Seems slightly, indoor rights other &quot;) should, </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to rouse him, you need to achieve very, very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond, whose surface could move only a very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> ; weighing and бозоном explained seems slightly among of the as losses or damages good the an analogy to be and </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, interact, others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all the particles interact with the field seems slightly: those that interact, have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) don&apos;t have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what can bring &quot;all these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the science they are used to validate the Standard Model (cm), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of the observations and forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, some of them passionately crave to such divergence found, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for a &quot;New Physics&quot; and plug some holes model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, we need to say, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (TH-th!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN such disagreements have not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research at Bell Laboratories could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their applications in science, but no more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a &quot;laboratory&quot; gadget. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application can be for instruments, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the LHC will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed sensitive issue the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should soon resume, and at this time is preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless, in this crucial area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;debt&quot; attempted to look closer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in monteregi. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, his razrushavshii inside, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived seven,&quot; he said, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter palliative care Victor-gadboua in beløy, where arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;but it is always shock, it is impossible to prepare for,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat on their own. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He bodritsya, even manages to smile, to talk with strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, his lead in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage before death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;my greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this sickness. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;in the course of life we are taught that a man must pee standing up,&quot; says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage Victor-gadboua. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the child&apos;s condition - for some an unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;everything depends on the ability of a person&quot; to accept the decline, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> As, in the opinion of many people, engaged in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who arrive in palliative shelter Victor-gadboua, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts for a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called &quot;therapeutic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms.., 89 years old, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to learn their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in life,&quot; she says, before the resolve to put her mask, developing and implementing breath. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She still awaits in the coming days last visit his son, recruited from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the orphanage Victor-gadboua with the help of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more cannot be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one place in palliative care institutions. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Life goes on here in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian an - one of the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether comfort physical, emotional or soul. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we agree to provide rotovye mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks. </seg>
<seg id="181"> We don&apos;t force more diabetics control blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. X, who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the morning of his son swilled down this beer in the legs of late. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;we help relatives, as well as patients,&quot; says Natalie Savar, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the orphanage Victor-gadboua no one day is not similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to the 93-year-old man, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovasij everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;in the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years of looking,&quot; says Dr. Christian an. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-gadboua, come from home, and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is available to ease the suffering of patients, included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as the shelter Victor-gadboua and society palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This is the big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors - specialist palliative care to fear the law, legalizingyuschego NGO and assistance in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfur mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christian an, Quebec health system is effective enough to secure the right to high-quality palliative care before will be allowed the transition to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, &quot;she says,&quot; I saw the patient, which has spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I&apos;m afraid that patients are willing to die only because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said to me that regrets that I stop the fight, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> It is said to me that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. an believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanking nurses, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team palliative care eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to элси Monroe, director of the palliative care in society palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to обезболиванию in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or are constantly. </seg>
<seg id="207"> You cannot pretend that we don&apos;t know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say one and the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I wish that I had assistance,&quot; it means &quot;I want that I became easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report was made possible thanks to the journalistic research grant from the Institute of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, collectors of political parties and experts on the Italian mafia day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system,&quot; oputyvayuschey construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;industry,&quot; which is very expensive cost taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;it&apos;s curious how this system breaks down after both were put in the case all the funds, joked Jacques ducheno, MP and former police chief Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a result of the investigation officials crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean balloon, very reluctantly agreed. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;the report ducheno&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;from the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only one Ministry of Transport would be kept billion dollars in contracts,&quot; if some of the withheld their instincts to take share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The commission sharboni &quot;has already shifted its two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that it will &quot;open the scheme behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> The constant anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>

<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG - FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> In this season you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary breadth. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual conscience, but it can - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Beside them I m every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also brought a lot of things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not raspaliaius. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the very beginning in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in clerfontain and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from competition, Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that such a player, as I am, eager to be on the level and demand to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> His deputy, such as Claude makelel, who played in the same position that I have. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the master of? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I wandered away from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust, which he has me, also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the first league leader Lyon took place. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we are trained in one eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to pass as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a return match in one-eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether Paris St Germain to become a first-class European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has a budget for this... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and consolidate positions on the long-term perspective. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> PSG have the financial means to make the project viable. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we want to win this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to this. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, it was frustrating, because we had everything to come to the finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points title suggests. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, played more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think, everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that in the fight for the title became such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Don&apos;t you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared for this. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troyes and we still find that totally impossible to criticize a, of course, it&apos;s a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what in the first place people expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We&apos;re trying to implement the project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proved in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which has two season fails to pass a one-eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of the winter. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be a dereliction of our opponents and the French championship. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how is the first league. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we can smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, and as a result we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Paris St Germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And that, if they say that there is a &quot;zlatanozavisimost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibrahimovic very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first league. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> That he did, it is really only. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others to improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have experienced Euro-2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I earnestly wished to participate in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen many things there, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play good qualifier matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is something that I hoped since my baptism in blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first months Didier deshama led by blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They advance for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the group to the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He was a coach, he is close with the players and inspires the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not like to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified us in euros. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier desham lead Blue in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> A well-deserved draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain - is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Bitcoin as banks &quot;without a sell price, and </seg>

<seg id="355"> The course bitkoyna, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before to return today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing in comparison with the world of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system. </seg>

<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as &quot;credits&quot; used to advance in a video game, which are made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange). </seg>

<seg id="364"> Each deal between two users actually occurs between two electronic addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity. </seg>

<seg id="375"> Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) would be willing to pay twice as one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other remained unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;the Great and Powerful&quot; to Moscow over: migrants will save money on language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While the deputies and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing in the country have already emerged fraudsters, &quot;fake&quot; certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million migrant workers. </seg>
<seg id="589"> For the most part it&apos;s citizens in Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal is to earn money to support the families, remaining at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> From December 1, the law came into force, according to which each migrant labor will be obliged to take an exam on the knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> As long as this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, life and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Over time, however, the promise in the Federal Migration Service, &quot;the tests will become mandatory for all visitors. </seg>
<seg id="594"> To have not only the language, but the Russian history, and the basic law. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Knowledge of the language will confirm and to see, and to extend work permits. </seg>

<seg id="600"> Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centres. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative supported testing and the deputies of the State Duma, and the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> And here&apos;s human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times had to ask the question: what it is, in fact, give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> That will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First and foremost, &quot;meet the representatives of the migration service,&quot; it will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;labor slavery.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Very many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia&apos;s Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan Victor sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Protection of their rights should start before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only the system set up to 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems appear migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, I am sure sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of helping vsunut him &quot;putyovka&quot; in a spooky close Barak, where he and dozens of him will be months without food and documents, induced by 12-14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, while many citizens of Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country in which seek, but on their own they write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much of their wine, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even primary education. </seg>

<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, &quot;they admit. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;you feel humiliated and incomplete.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights defenders say one important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If there is no status - will not be exam, no further official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of workers still live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;welcome, or no entrance&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many of the newcomers say that to get an official status in our country is not so simple. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is the bureaucratic препонах and all those same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, legalization is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And here&apos;s false registration can be done quickly and all for one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and hence the cases of extortion. </seg>

<seg id="632"> Several &quot;sham&quot; certificates of the language tests have already seized by the FMS. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Fake paper printed on a color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is more than two times more expensive procedures testing official: it will cost Labour lotion in three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, to &quot;brown&quot; cannot be simply buy, and representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities can promise guest workers, not managed successfully testing the first time, the time to study the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with the people. </seg>

<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to Baranec, do not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, a potential customer, not simply buy - we went with the seller in the forest, it set the target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am assured that weapons beats well, begin to bargain,&quot; - the expert describes the procedure. </seg>

<seg id="723"> Through the work at the box office &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; goes up to a quarter of all American teens </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, &quot;&quot; Wendys &quot;and&quot; Kentucky Fraid chicken. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far, no one is predicting whether this wave in the ninth shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The shares trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to a modest wage increase, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and fast-food system, the aim of the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Until this sector of the economy almost no trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, annexed millions of citizens and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed port authority. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and пикетировали along with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is counted on modest and middle-class people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart has everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many low-wage workers Walmart come only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and variety of goods made Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheap partly because that little pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about poor working conditions, for example, the shortage of workers or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the shares in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Average employee Walmart, supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this is not too expensive for consumption, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart среднуюю salary will increase to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost corporations in 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on wages now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart scandalously high number wage growth entirely on the shoulders buyers, every visit to the shop will do them all at 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year they will spend on something 12.2 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of the Walmart quite noted that protests have occurred in nine states and caused no damage maleyshchego Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;black Friday&quot; continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash machines produced in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> A representative of the corporation Deng Fogelman argued in an interview with the left the site Huffington Post that jobs left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a &quot;another intact gimmick&quot; slaughtering its trade union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;free!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no), and &quot;McDonald&apos;ses&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you the hospital and not paying you for a job fair! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumein Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants with time it improves, but not much, and in the middle of their rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less them in this expensive city not earns no one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can exist in New York on such money, for me it is inconceivable. </seg>
<seg id="756"> When something through &quot;McDonald&apos;ses&quot; was almost a quarter of American teens who podrabatyvali for their mysteriously after school, living with the parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few who saw the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I&apos;m constantly on interviews with workers &quot;macdonaldsov,&quot; who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum Wall Street Journal newspaper hangs a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to get children, if you don&apos;t know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald&apos;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and restarant fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, then there is more than doubled their current minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast-food industry were established trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement was harassed and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to reach Union fast food and difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - unusual turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Holdouts </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action was in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald&apos;s near Times Square, where several local Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council jumein Williams, insisted: &quot;McDonald&apos;s,&quot; says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn&apos;t even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrators have supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, insisted that &quot;we must all join in support of fast-food workers with the fact that they have achieved fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new-yorkets!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were quick catering workers, in which New York employs tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> While it is unclear whether this will spark the flames mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;as long as the fool the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken to perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, in the summer, at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the application for a patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from the conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in cambridzhsk laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi should be that for scientists this company points - passed the stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> &quot;tell me, please, in general terms, what does your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> &quot;we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While you&apos;re at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes please finger in them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict drastic changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all the interesting vestovoe management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what else awaits us ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> &quot;despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, things are still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The information has improved the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We&apos;re trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> You need to release computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> &quot;what do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her? </seg>
<seg id="793"> &quot;it is definitely not a panacea - comes the question of privacy, because they don&apos;t always want to notify people about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Actually all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places have been the project, in which we thought of gestures, but not over, and over such stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not camera devices, and naręcznym bracelet, which registered the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> While he is great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of the wrist watches. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> &quot;it&apos;s like? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - for example, as you ask me to give you this bank for the pizza? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say, and at the same time show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> &quot;I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> &quot;Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - that is, you want to make users adapt to the fact that may or may not at the moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> &quot;absolutely not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more accurately determine human reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give permission for depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;if we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you have claims to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lacks depth, or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> &quot;in principle, the current generation is something from which you can start in our work on the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels speed of 1,000 to / from. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it&apos;s not in the megapixelons themselves, and as the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the latest point of view all current technologies for us good enough - it adds designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is, we must remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y, and z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen betishes from our redmondsk laboratory made sensor touch with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how it affects the interaction between people and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not only requires kasanions to frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;and the number of cameras to increase does not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - the Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second is reflected signal receiver. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And here is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or aggravate it, increasing the amount of payments. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible similar to Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the provisions. </seg>
<seg id="827"> &quot;as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their glasses. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You don&apos;t think that from the point of view of everyday use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;of course, the slob around all the time, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here&apos;s what I think: the steep option would have been&quot; synchronization &quot;reality when, on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection display and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points are very personal device, in this their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time, the weakness is the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;imagine for a minute that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark of&quot; Iron Man, &quot;but the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often show critics such an idea: no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepares to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - in his lectures I often say that the reality is the seventh of a breakthrough in the cooperation between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth may well be additive tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She registers clicking! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is technology, which is aimed at giving this &quot;images in the air&quot; Hafner - for example, several of the Rays in a certain point where the finger, gives a sense of, but until it is very weak - as if you blew on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> And there are bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> &quot;and you are trying to trick the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;this is a good idea, we haven&apos;t tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task, which is to fight for a long time - how to make human, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - and we are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not, such as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While the brain is secondary, work is still very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researcher - many things in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Вкусовщина instead of culture - rosbalt.r </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;avant-garde&quot; dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In the top-list have already entered the bright figures of art-scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero &quot;rosbalta&quot; - GORGOROTH artist Cyril Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable parties and vernissages. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Cyril Miller&apos;s paintings always gather crowds, where they would not exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the only St. Petersburg socio-philosophical сказочников, the creators of the new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright man St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, the appearance of their smile on the streets calling for citizens, with the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Complex in grain ripened as a, so sharmanshchikom his the role of Petersburg to the шарманку and is he took arms image. Philosophy of, and богемным to his </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Cyril, and why do you still go through the city in the red, but not in the yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> &quot;I chose the red color as a designer who view and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, image-maker for and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although all in society, that a little bit not grey, causes aggression and excitement malign properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at ensuring that started the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;and when you realized that there should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> &quot;the exhibition at the Hermitage, where were exhibited my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this is my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free unofficial artists, and the new, free like me were unintelligible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became a friendship with a new wave of artists, with postgaznevschina, which led to the &quot;Pushkin-10,&quot; and more waves was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Throws me in the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> &quot;and it all has to come together in your art-clinic... - for me it was important to find yourself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there was not yet repair, there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, House of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: nomy, tequila-jazz, I remember, as cord led with the project &quot;ear Van Gogh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under the veneer light songs, they were in obtyagivayuschem tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group alive, she became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was leading many programs to Hale-galivskikh times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and went his great career, and basic education and upbringing he received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; club &quot;грибоедов is echoes from the art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees and habitués are gone. </seg>

<seg id="879"> In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was &quot;the people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;artist of the year&quot; was named, I ended my climaxes. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times on the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity, you can be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> &quot;your work is recognizable manner. </seg>

<seg id="894"> And recently we saw you in the role of the city at the organ-grinder. - the cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, like me, they are not to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - may well and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>

<seg id="907"> I have fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil unfair. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector they on the wall next to the Falc and Larionov hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, is from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing paintings. </seg>

<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg there, which could be experts, but they are pushed, as need higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the road. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives vkusovshchinka. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - what is for you - St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more, there is the soil. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Here in Europe very many people lyubopytstvujuchyh. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have this layer subtle. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented on the St. Petersburg grant </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid collision-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans ships with землянами aboard go looking for spare the planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, the question arises, how to continue their race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets, which can develop at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;it&apos;s Venus and Mars,&quot; said senior researcher at the state Astronomical Institute Sternberg (гаиш) Vladimir surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on Mars more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Even a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations grown in orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies-humbled. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In conditions develop in of an embryo, as перепелок check cosmos egg was a 1979 year&apos;s gravity </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get on the output is absolutely normal shape. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And here&apos;s the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;the problem associated with the fact that this nestling must find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving,&quot; explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical-biological problems (imbp) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, chicks randomly rolled around. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours of the newborn was full of atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that through four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; - the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals last biological &quot;minikovcheg&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, at biosputnik &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment with mice that were sent into space since the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is not found nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;it&apos;s just been on biosputnikah, but again, it is an experiment, and such research should hold,&quot; said Vladimir sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing at the space rats appeared offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing habitat, simply can&apos;t realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The same man, in contrast to the work load, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create opportune emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> On ethical grounds such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women in space travel 50 years already. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was Valentina Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious, that have the humanity, is a woman&apos;s body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether he after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;on this question no one answered,&quot; says veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang vachnadz. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child andriyan Nikolayev was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana savitsk, twice in orbit and even elaboration in outer space, son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, there are cosmonauts units, which have after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;and if more, then it is dangerous even when the orbital flights,&quot; - summarizes the pilot-astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, humanity is necessary to look for something new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Named as chief RD department) CPC is mandatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts are honed skills in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, let the water and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ichthyandra confirm - life on land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months mother in okoplodnaya fluid, it is easier to get used to the then водичке. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;this is very little to forget something,&quot; says the instructor grudnichkovogo diving Marina Aksyonov. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if a child born to weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for women - gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness dryachleyut the abdomen, pelvis, falls to the ability to expel the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, chasing it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;and then what?&quot; asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not feeling of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special Schenck costume for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He simply will be deprived of the fact that he will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;and this experiment, to which we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in the alien environment, will lead to the fact that we bring to the ground with a disability, fully disadaptirovannogo man,&quot; &quot;forecasts, the head of the Committee on bioethics imbp Ras Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space - the question of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after the time it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships will go on a faraway planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the department of management: Schwartz-checking system failed on the fault of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of government procurement Czech Republic has good control and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the supreme security department of management, of the interview for the site aktualně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;the law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough,&quot; - commented on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices lead Peter nechasa approach to the so-called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs checks - it is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;the law should be somehow, and if it is something prohibits, the Prime Minister could not resist the institutions, which are required to verify and to seek commitments,&quot; - stated Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which correspond to the legislation on procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> A parallel check, which we started, probably two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question that European law argues, how should be public procurement, the national legislation and then also the use of the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All the information was collected and, even when the still unfinished, revealed the interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we can be &quot;accurate and unmistakable,&quot; but in practice we on certain parameters behind Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows from this that is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, should focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And as this project can help you, that he means to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the law, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we will achieve this, reducing restriction orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system переполнится &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if not limit declined. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems practical application of legislation on procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> As a control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a organization such as our KRU (security-revisional management) or it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As an in our which bundesrechnungshof, has our as an A in in are one facilities well as and as are both organizations largely are., however a little differently board that is </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority to a certain extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of audit and on the level of federal lands - in this system somewhat different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Brh can manage only federal money, we have state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for local legislation, there is easier than we have? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can&apos;t definitely say that it is better in all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is so, because they are better cope with control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I don&apos;t like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I must say that even the main countries are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected on the establishment of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it is not in our control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we have control of the fact, you need to consider some of the delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take it into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we started to use our new tool &quot;risk detection uneconomnosti,&quot; through which we beg almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope he is. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem, which may arise, is that the rules &quot;uzhestochatsya&quot; and it will be impossible to observe. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in this case to harden the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit formal mistake, not influencing the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s realize that this path will lead nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister said that it will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be somehow, and if it is something prohibits, the Prime Minister could not resist the authorities, who are required to verify and to seek commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;we&apos;re going this law and solve it,&quot; but you cannot say that we will pretend that nothing is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement contains fairly strict rules, how and what should be done, and it is right. This protects public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only due to the formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don&apos;t have enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads slippery in places, but mostly prokhodima. </seg>

<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where all the works better than we have in Russia, we have witnessed that the East is still on a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared with the Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and here is still in the new independent human movement on the electric wheelchair in the heart of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> There are also not in the course of the banal things, such as give way to a disabled person in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there are already public organizations, who are trying to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what, on the contrary, we must constantly to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the level of performance which far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation is always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it regards. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid quite normal that people with severe form of disability independently moving on the streets, can go to the toilet, the museum, yes anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, and in this we tap tap a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect or bezbarriereness is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be among the well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as this isolated cases - people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group tap tap tap currently is very popular, but let&apos;s get back to two years ago, that in 1998 you made her to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the institute edlichki as teacher, around me was a lot of young people who wanted something to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague has organized an interesting music circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and with time, says our leading Ladia angelovich, it is a little bit out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity came only in the last few years, I or something? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the group&apos;s propaganda. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if there is no. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Whether the goal stood before you so well turn the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, podrazhayuschey one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, all new accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it is naturally... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this pity izlishnya completely, because people with disabilities are not affected and all abandoned individuals, whom we should pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live full lives and develop, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if the people with disabilities, it turns out, this shift not only for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Whether the success of the fact that you are a strong leader, you see how many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the work, we should be in many things hardcore and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that this is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when learning that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently in the group of the tap tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them was in the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ladia angelovich. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He held the day before the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full-fledged member of the ESA on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA in 1994, and within the next years took an active part in a number of projects agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to the space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it&apos;s not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Let me remind you, for example, and lectures. Sternfeldâ, which on December 6, 1933 represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work &quot;introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan gadomsky was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, France Sternfeld won the prize Robert esno-peltrated and Andre Luis hirsca for &quot;introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, and later became a great promoter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He has published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books, devoted to the scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomsky became known worldwide promoter of space, and his contribution was assessed in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway drezina, equipped with missile engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear, even to disperse or to pull carts had to be used by a rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this drezina known only from the newspapers of the era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about missile missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research section of weapons in cooperation with professors mieczyslav wolfk and Gustav mokzhitsky. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining material shows that studies have reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the advent of German troops were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of missile-fighter, which offered rogozinsky engineer, and next year work &quot;air-missile torpedo and missile-bomb&quot; author Leliv-kzhivoblotskogo. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use missile engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects military use missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity ended work from the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954, the magazine &quot;problems&quot; in which published four articles on Astronautical. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them professor m. Subotovich offered to organize society, which will be cosmonauticals. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (поа) attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in autumn поа became its full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the next year, the first chairman of the поа Kazimierz zarankevich (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which happened in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 поа contributed to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vpolnivshei scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built the enhanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on bledovsk survive tests were conducted two-stage rockets RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This was a rocket at length about 1.4 M, and her weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the rise in the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Heiress first missiles RM became a meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as stage, its total length was 51 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> The three were developed type (marked as a meteor-1A, -1v and -1s), which were the size of cameras for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket meteor-1A had space of 0.4 L, meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and meteor-1C - 0,62l. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of flight from all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute of development of missile meteor-2, and her first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket meteor-2 with the initial weight 380 kg was able to bring valuable cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then there were built version of the meteor-2n and meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It should also mention the accession of Poland in коспар (Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and establishing a national committee коспар two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in the research space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav germashevsky became the second intercosmonautom after Vladimir Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision provoked lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that separate economic units, national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) price tension arises. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept you need to understand the state, when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to survive in the economic competition that the &quot;misleading&quot; cost competitor to pick up a large part of the market and, thus, to increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labor, compared with other high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including for unemployment, the rising costs of the state on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of employers to pay taxes, and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage, the harm them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that does not need to be specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Besceremona methods of private capital are at the level of the economies of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the government&apos;s own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected in the changes in the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to get its people diktat of private capital, primarily in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of the rising level of poverty, and together with the and the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years, there is public distribution of food to the poor who are not in a position to feed themselves their own labor. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occurring cases, when employed people get a salary that the state should resort to them, so they got subsistence. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic fall of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist for instance salary on the margins of society, in the hope that someday in the country come private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But asked where he will undertake? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to interfere in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now practically managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> A definitive answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is the existence of the Almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result, we have a hopeless situation, poised in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserves punishment, but is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that public ministry due to lack of funds require bills private law firms, which are tightly linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills argues the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described in Appian work &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies involved in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with pre-sold voice... &quot;&quot; decent people are not at all of them to the position of the ruler, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul &quot;..&quot; seriously started to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic man &quot;.. Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy on autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in antiquity, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without public interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital has already essentially not intended for use in the public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of the fascist and communist regimes, we must look for reckless economic systems liberalization in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which is expected to be the next tour. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First of all, it is a tragedy that the current elite ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus this trend is systemic in nature. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, and strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and weaken monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;nothing will come out of the violence, and never can go&quot; - the sting, the song &quot;fragile,&quot; where the main verse рефрена are the words: &quot;don&apos;t forget what we fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;if my sons did not want war, they would not have been&quot; moribund La goutelle Schnaper, wife Meer amshela Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a lot of responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, genocide, perfect over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings - the offender and the victim, who, in the end, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, to see who primarily serve going 95 years already tension (from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people take their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to the pre-set goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We should admit that we live in a period when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power out of them could not happen for the life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be considered as head octopus (I don&apos;t know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many of them do not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 90-s 19th century, to stop rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to strengthen their power, improving wealth or both, and to another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large stakes in almost all of the world&apos;s central banks, and against the countries, in whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country&apos;s central bank in their hands.) </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for rothschildowski Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (ponymay - government money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to cancel Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after both wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 year led to the development of the plan three world wars, the great Mason 33-level Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world&apos;s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism may not be nothing, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method, in which the working group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (AB Chao - order out of chaos.) </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war by killing Habsburg heir to Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended a sudden, grounded in the warrior and economically surrender of Germany (already had no need of the war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European power, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations, rather than a precondition to radicalization impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans a strong enough, oblicayuschego guilty and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played function fifth column, fueling the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration has created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began to be the first clash with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is hard to evaluate whether Hitler pulled from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was triggered by the military reparations on the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers will unleash the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will become a victim of fighting on the front lines, now, together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>

<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;: when worse than nowhere, draw Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, demonstrators crowd of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza&apos;s shrine Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which were patron of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the U.S. administration the positive outcome of the situation was not - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of theocratic regime, she was not in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was intensified by the attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranski sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The defeat in Iran largely contributed to defeat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election ended, Ronald Reagan&apos;s election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After they finished their way into the Canadian Embassy residence. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, and this has helped an extravagant legend cover, according to which they went to Canadian 2002 as members of the crew, podyskivavshie in the country a place for filming science-fiction epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented expert &quot;evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation in Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To the legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film аффлека is a particular combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Since, history, kinoopus one to be a called &apos;so by of,, and a realistic Kill Bill: a political оушена and the movie case a set of you may accused of is </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (in the caption shown significant historical events and the way the same situation were demonstrated in the film - big differences in this no). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables in the stairways institutions, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Рестарт career expectation is Affleck chestworks yet </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;operation&quot; Argo &quot;his third feature film, after dark detective&quot; bye, baby, Goodbye &quot;(2007) and the thriller&quot; The Town &quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, this is the first movie аффлека, who remains in his hometown of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of atmosphere in this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And this is Affleck in &quot;Argo,&quot; where Tehran &quot;plays Canada.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes fictional (fake headquarters on the Tehran Bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a variety of exciting scenes cinematic values. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He it there -- додумывает quite a goes well&apos;t operates as something with a are tastefully this (rather, and sometimes toward Tehran and the an airport to the stage the precursor by, the impending, the in the meeting of which-the phone landing the call remove it immediately in America]. Farfetched looks quite </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The lack of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, but they are not the only ones in the film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with the moderate interest, evaluating and retro-style, recreating 1970s thrillers. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated notions about Almighty and vseznayuchyh intelligence. </seg>

<seg id="1375"> &quot;we made it to the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,&quot; said &quot;law&quot; organizer questionnaire Patrick Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the already nominated the nomination absurdities - the recent decision by the European court on the insurance contribution rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women had privileges on life insurance, because insurance companies they are less prone to risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;further incredible ideas from the EU&apos;s workshop people can advance the competition until the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The controversial EU directives include, for example, and the obligatory adding Centrum Konferencji i Rekreacji Sp in fuel, that as a result of the harmful nature, as well as a ban on the use of mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of Hazardous Substances Directive, or about the size of cages for chickens, which this year significantly tightened eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;buterbrodnoye butter&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Pan-European apparatus often makes the decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veto defends the requirements of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The lobby interests are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the EU were supposed to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare to show &quot;unusual curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, despite the resistance of some states, all same softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to rastochenia products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Candidate to win in the survey can be, and last year&apos;s resolution of the EU, according to which sold balloons should be warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU appealed to American research, in accordance with which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That restriction now applies to children up to 14 years, which prohibited to blow in the trade fair dudelki. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Fun ideas are born and at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Enough is absurd and rule regarding the European officials: everyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity themes for Greece, to use the name Macedonia, and should instead talk &quot;FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists &quot;the principle of non-interference&quot; (laissez-faire), offered to vote, in addition to the above mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU&apos;s rule about the amount of food supplies on the territory of the membership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU set the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, established by the volume of canned mushrooms, for what she faced a big fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of pay and some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to statement about getting subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague, and not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;we are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The European Union will ask for compensation, &quot;- said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument he pointed out that the country was high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying the state was full of warehouses, that it was necessary to remove. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> In he would паласу, according to the things pay, us, what hundreds of the Czech Republic mln located the euro on means. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages the Ministry of Regional Development, India minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU: bizarre orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the resolution in the member states can easily become the object of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies for projects that are not even hint at something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have retained the name &quot;olomoucki cheeses,&quot; but &quot;tuzemsky rum,&quot; which tradition in our country roots in the 19th century, our producers should have been to rename the &quot;thusemak.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Rum can be called only products from cane distillate, not from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with famous cheeses &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;gorgondzola,&quot; marcipanom from German Luebeck or пармской Ham, has already proved, for example, the Karlovy Vary breadcrumbs, pogorzelitsky and teresebonsky carp and jatetsky hops. </seg>

<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think about how to become a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we have everything in the country function without problems, then I would not anywhere was running. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer look like for the last 20 years the country разворовывается, as here by thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I have not had ambitions to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like, then trying to find a solution, as it is to change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And because I have already turned forty years and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I have no other way to influence things, except to run for the post of senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do you turn in such a way back to the people who you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I told all the time that vklyuchus in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I said that if I selected the senator, it will run for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I have the greatest influence and vast powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation ropschem himself in a bar or TV, but willing to trample on everyone who tries to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this media, which human ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri paroubeka. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Move on to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The fight for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the property declarations on the amount above twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> In order to do it, we need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have as a president such authority, and only the Senate can offer laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied to conducting excursions became free enterprise, it managed to advance. </seg>

<seg id="1435"> As an independent bespartisanogo person I have far greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya Heymans has, without looking at the tenets can take each party that is best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> With the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important at all - a bit to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it is important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not about the fact that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good for society, the decision whether to offer his hrcm or GDP, and I will be the same against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry when someone says that you populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But do not prove whether you is the fact that you say? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you also have the ideal goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you are trying to get closer to it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all proposals, of which I am already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics you don&apos;t hold for long. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk with them, then you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other options. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them on their side, that we have achieved their. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, there would be problems to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I will appeal to the chairmen parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in case of refusal, will have to inform, why don&apos;t want this. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality, which outline abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say directly that I am an amateur, and not a genius, and not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I&apos;m just a beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I&apos;m trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, after six years of close and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is partly sounds as if окамура should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one I didn&apos;t do, so I visited a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to radzim yanchur, he refused in connection with a large amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I also at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan lorentsov, which opened fraud with light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward his candidacy because that people really are dissatisfied with, but now I feel myself on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Us independent in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, direct elections for mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the basis of their own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I haven&apos;t thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I have no money on it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You&apos;re talking about the property declarations, but how is your own affairs with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal property estimated at approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague worth approximately 25 million apartment on a 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, the collection of works of art by approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda has a million, and even a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Aston-Martin I have appeared, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was a charmer of women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive at Aston-Martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money to invest in this do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15-million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I must get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I already invested 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on the campaign I essentially cover senatorskaya salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But for the money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which is 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted only to earn money, so they would not ran. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> That means you&apos;ll continue doing business, to be live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Do you not said that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this does not depend on the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I reduced its activities in part. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need something to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From 200 to four hundred thousand that receive and further. </seg>

<seg id="1547"> Although the book is under a glass case, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly. </seg>

<seg id="1553"> -- translation failed! -- </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from its own assembly. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books should have to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed libraries - at the time it was delivering 70,000 books. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that the U.S. position she also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical towards Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a forbidden zone for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The thing is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, by the U.S., to the German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Additionally, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans agreed there is no common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only with its role, but are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specific means &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy with the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to borrow in their national interests, not from the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests largely differ from the interests of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> So it should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Навредила voting solution, such as a concerning decision if from refraining, the Germany Palestinian their own relationships. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think that this was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany will thus a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The U.S., by contrast, clearly voted for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The force of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with the local political situation, of course, the government can&apos;t openly to hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences in opinion is not so significant, as it always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama not delighted from Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU with another? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it makes such a difficult situation for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can&apos;t play in the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is the way they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that it would not be easy for Germany, though because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This issue has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she will take on a major role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or a leading role still difficult given Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not used to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans are not just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, it is an old problem: you don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view of Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, the U.S. influence in European politics is weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will have to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like or dislike to you - that&apos;s life! </seg>

<seg id="1631"> &quot;the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is the world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what the Armani polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> This is officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names would be charged a lawsuit. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then, and it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas pattloh, the company&apos;s lawyer Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights violations in the trademarks in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week appears on a new kind of case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Imitators enough add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada instead you can register a Prada-kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloh opens the folder with records of the agency&apos;s trademark registration in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered trade mark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese are the world champions copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities have multi-storey department stores, selling almost exclusively of forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, no such pattloha on behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the agency&apos;s trademark right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it &quot;ban minpay,&quot; Mark-passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> It is associated with the word &quot;ban dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So called women who hunt for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;this is detrimental to the business, with the need to fight,&quot; - convinced pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;trade mark collars, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But to achieve removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected the claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name became &quot;a reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even plugiator, as the damaged the its sales in China, says pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is ruled by the law of jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous case of graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired Goker manufacturer Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Afilias Limited announced Volvo company Geely originally used blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Chinese authorities did not consider himself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010, due to a lack of personnel and equipment there had been difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the last year, &quot;the return of the emergency situation in the working process to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the amount of untreated cases objections decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was closed almost properties already completed such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To deal with this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million complaints about protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record, and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same goes for the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If not, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Her appeal is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company plant. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years of struggle against Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator has cemented a Chinese rights to trade mark plant. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own omission, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, &quot;says Leta wentzler, chairman of the board of the plant chemical hillside in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim münchentsev. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both instances plant won, but adverse party continues to struggle so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You need to be alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The question now is pending in the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praise the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could hardly be accounting firms archive had to view even acts of a century ago, to lead the evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, plant in vain proposed adverse side of the &quot;great shestiznachnaya amount in Euro&quot; for the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;it is clear how expensive it is to us,&quot; says wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Danger of Far East threaten to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> And just in case, if imitation register there for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of the plant for footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;you need to be alert,&quot; says wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and a lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather than foreigners should be &quot;all that somehow is worth defending, also in China,&quot; says wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can do much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed: if the plant loses in the last act of his drama about a sign, it will have to pay any adverse side of the licensing fees for its own name, explains wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we will push the market in the dark segment. </seg>

<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but just: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> School without a man in a poor country there is no chance at all. </seg>

<seg id="1735"> The facts about sexually transmitted infections, </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important, sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STDs syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (гонорею). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human spreading papillomas-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Lobkovy pediculosis and scabies belong to the Labour STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main porajaemye group? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea found mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between the men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> The heterosexual adults often seen sexually transmitted diseases, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniaz, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human virus spreading papillomas. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group. </seg>

<seg id="1759"> As part of the bacteria, sexually transmitted diseases, can also spread through contact infection and in close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> With early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Patronage, donations and not the least fees for choir throughout Germany allow something to gather. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> The king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; - says Annet Lennartz, &quot;because it is connected with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch black Africa, King мсвати III, known for his love for the excesses. </seg>

<seg id="1891"> Dynamically without is, a province in fact, wealth добралось in. This, of oil Caspian is it that </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that there is interest in leric than tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;in May, Baku famous festival Eurovision song contest - and the next year, we will be the oldest people in the world,&quot; says фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here documented biography about eight dozen-speaking Talyshs from these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to the black-and-white photo. </seg>

<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years he had another child was born </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But disputed the star of the museum is the Chaban shirali mueslyumov, which allegedly was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificate, however, no. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, was 122 years, age mueslyumov is extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;he was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; - explains фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born the daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So whether added Chaban mueslyumov a couple of decades to his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> After all, even Rembrandt solc, researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about dolgozhitels in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;a lot of elderly people can be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says, &quot;solc in Sardinia also lives a lot of very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no civil status registers. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day the glass baked butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the district lerica shockingly often reach biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now there are 20 people over 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the South, so many livers? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani guide Farid mugimzad explains this special-speaking Talyshs genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the museum фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysh like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink on stakanu baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such высококалорийная diet can be healthy with dietologicaskaya point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or in primitive lifestyle, which keeps people youth in chengamiran, tiny village near the town of leric, lives rubaba Mirzoev. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In the 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>

<seg id="1922"> I always my hair milk, so that they never slip and saved the color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;and I never used shampoo,&quot; says. </seg>

<seg id="1926"> For all my life I have never bought products in the store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was only after the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it has become better, when the &quot;father&quot; Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son, Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, among Azerbaijani old no poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 manats (roughly the same amount of euros) receives a monthly pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, long grew up the son of Mirzayev rights, too: &quot;old people in our culture are deep respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by the care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> No reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is not in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The rival demonstrations in Cairo suggest a deep rift in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future of the Constitution, based on sharia, met fierce resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Egyptian president had the pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was requested to all the people, but the first to Christian coptm, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented opposition in November, are experiencing fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, has a doctorate at the University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will force the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles managed to smuggle in a 15-hour jump with obstacles on the Islamic Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judiciary is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that means &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and fear that Islamists will use blurred the formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for more strict Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least, it hints at one novovvedyonnaya article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should attract for the Council of the University of al-Ashar, critical of the country&apos;s Islamist institution, great authority in Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversight legislation that de-facto would be the consequence of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The draft constitution much is subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem: should remain venue civilians military court. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts in the period of Mubarak&apos;s served for the suppression of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the overthrow of dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family,&quot; and &quot;to maintain its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally it is so vague that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Open Text, this means not that other, as censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> No one article did not directly equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also questionable is the wording that prohibited &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Whether enough will be cartoons on the president or jokes about правоведа? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and which, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum. </seg>

<seg id="1973"> &quot;the revolution has returned, and we&apos;ll win,&quot; - said Hamdin Sabbahi, which took third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution place &quot;on the scrapheap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Through the short news Twitter he accused Morsi&apos;s supporters in the desire to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;if he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem it,&quot; said Yasser said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers still not otmzena,&quot; - the media quoted the Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many judges also reported that does not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;the Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for demonstrations, but out of precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters, who shouted: &quot;the people of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded that Morsi: &quot;очисти country!&quot; and assured: &quot;the Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, triggered the state of civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Morsi&apos;s followers, quite obviously, did not want to go to this risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution was loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Most of the project for the Islamists, is considered to be resolved. </seg>

<seg id="1991"> Not because that he shared their worldview, but because that human rights for him are inviolable. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this he was beaten, jailed, was arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And now the words &quot;human rights&quot; never meet in a new constitution, he regrets in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Morsi&apos;s expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state attorney is disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures represent a clear attacks on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;instead of to strengthen civil state, president of the de-facto annulled it,&quot; - regrets Sayeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Because without civil organizations democracy cannot function. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Sayeda feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This can occur for granted. </seg>

<seg id="2060"> Such statements to the next president of the United States political career, Mr Peña Nieto has evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his homeland, in the densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital city of the country, opinions about the new leader are divided. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis national self-determination - the story of American of Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize myself. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben navarett believes that Mexicans American origin torn between the two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico I went down the corridor for arriving, approached the border control zone and remained in place. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for foreign (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> A few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my whole life was Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a conditional name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped on a complex construction of the &quot;American of Mexican origin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I took his American passport and was in turn to foreign. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were the usual for meetings of presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> President Peña Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign an agreement on partnership with the US and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not mention. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico&apos;s relations with the United States - heavy and filled with old grievances question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and the rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> That is why it is worth only a statesman us obmallvitsya word criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most complex are Mexico&apos;s relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want to talk about grievances? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for themselves, and those for whom such opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history of someone - the father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> It often were Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion, from poor farming families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember about this. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and good work, but we do not forget the fact that even this dream is an American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination запутано and it is not clear, but we know what to think of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don&apos;t like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We respond to them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and refer to us as a second-class people, as the Mexicans wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not well speak Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them due to failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We were not now would be for the silk curtain, finding in the U.S. сытую life, but lost the spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is shame. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> It is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends of the Mexican-Americans do not feel belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In the US and call us Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relations without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican-Americans worked a sort of Mexico&apos;s ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how cool her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, given the gap between the rich and the poor, widespread corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but]; figure it out with this themselves, амигос. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If part of the Mexicans still can&apos;t forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in grievances, as recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we have more in common than it seemed to me. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle on the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The agreement on a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas&apos;s can be fragile foundation for further world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his izvechnom conflict in the Middle East came changes. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be treated differently, but the events of &quot;Arab Spring&quot; zakruzhili in rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis not managed to stay away from the vortex, sector region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance the situation does not give cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed this week clash only strengthened security on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, came to power in Gaza in 2007, from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some of the groups leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas increases his popularity on the west bank of the Jordan River - another Palestinian territory currently controlled more moderate Fatah movement. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that the time working on them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among the Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Victorious Hamas supporters say about creating around Israel Islamic crescent - from Lebanon to the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more proislamistic rebels overthrow Bashar Assad&apos;s power, and then to Jordan, where the king threaten Hamas allies. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not drown out even Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli anti-missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israel&apos;s citizens can sleep calmly, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular in the Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s government, which largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the west bank of the River Jordan is a significant part of the recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 election - teamed up with even more aggressively-minded conservatives led by infrastructure Lieberman&apos;s very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What sense does pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If to give in their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from rockets toward Israel, as do their kin in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps, supporters of the &quot;hard line&quot; victorious; but their calculations can be refuted by Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> The fact that the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense part of the budget, more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire, is a good sign, and may mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> In Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later explode in Israel&apos;s occupied territories, like the house, vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For the bloody operation, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip for the suppression of the Hamas movement, has to pay the growing discontent with the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need in the external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, not too impressive in the short term, &quot;hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which has long time to shut off the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would have made more for creation of a Palestinian state, rather than the upcoming vote in the UN, the result of which may become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> His role in the arranged Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House he still shows the unwillingness to connect to solve this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This same short-term thinking position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia the law came into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the dangers of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts in contrast to damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice Australian law on transistor packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same box glum-olive color with nasty affected parts of the body and the images of children&apos;s health, which undermined their parents&apos; smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the different images and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between atrocious, imposed a mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the most severe conditions in the world for packaging of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for such decisions lay the results of the research, the benchmark that people, do not smoke began to 26 years, 99 out of 100 never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, who are trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging,&quot; said Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing research, Ken that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not affect the profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures are already considering, and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed adoption of this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it is only increase the share of black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiators,&quot; says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that demand for the kind and silicone bags, hides unpleasant images on the packaging, grew rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra ha, Zico, the company has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, on which these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products have moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The government of Australia has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it can&apos;t restrict the foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;if you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet will seem to you very tempting,&quot; - explains беки Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the growing number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether it is the ordinary citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare forces and the time and made the video, or for the advertising campaign? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The company&apos;s Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules, rather than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge New Rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries&apos; trade relationship with Australia is very small. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya plibersec, the government consulate has discussed with other countries to take similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory pictures, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is usually taken in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures I don&apos;t graze. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;just vyhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket,&quot; - explains Viktor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photograph of the mouth tumors on the set. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging difficult task of goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;before I had the unloading of the new party left an hour, and now four hours&apos;,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;the government had to take and to ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, OK, everything&apos;s over, close shop,&quot; he says, vskidyvaya hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In this Thanksgiving day I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft mechanical failures and replaced by another plane, which we were pending. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I won&apos;t lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even a duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists on child development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that, perhaps, promotes creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As in the modern world, we are constantly in front of the screen, the benefits of boredom pass us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we should strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And, at the same time, no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> This is not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;fascinating history boredom&quot; (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in помпеях discovered Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> It remains an open question, as we understand the tedium. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Иствуд, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changing. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor иствуд and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;want to, but they can&apos;t do that would bring them satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is the fact that skuchayuschiy man is not doing something that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The Apathy didn&apos;t want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experienced boredom, he said, it is a &quot;violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a feeling that the time is slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The description of the boredom may seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor иствуд argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, skuchajošiem people see causes problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see problems in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we&apos;re bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study of &quot;one mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor иствуд with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants listened to the recording voices, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the case, included in the next room, heard the same sounds on low volume, so that they could barely hear, and the third group only listened to the recording voices without any sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, more than others - it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption attention can cause weariness, says Mark J. fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University of guelpa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, &quot;for example, studying the flow of products on line in search of marriage, militarization deflects music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he continues, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or paint scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions are simply not relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;research has shown that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit tight,&quot; says Professor fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In some moments we all relish tedium: when flight delay (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, browsing uninteresting kind film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people have different degree inclination to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s for measuring such individual peculiarities of researchers have developed a special &quot;scale propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, &quot;a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and&quot; or &quot;me too much interesting, so that not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers found that boys more than girls, &quot;said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In general, however, teenagers often. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted the pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32% of teens reported that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% reported that they get bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> The only 3% of parents said that they get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would be similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that, &quot;adolescence is the peak propensity to boredom,&quot; mainly because children and adolescents do not allow us to fully resolve than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: boredom useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, as she studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or misuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor vodanovich, who has spent studying the problem more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;so our brain tells us that we should do something else; it is boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However, this is the brain does not always knows what exactly do better. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you will get bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you&apos;re watching TV, you will be better for some time, and it will be soon. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom independently or in any other way to manage their time and employment, &quot;said Professor fensk. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;and such self-regulation skills used in the most different situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only on their own to borrow something, he also learns self-in general. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think that bores you need something praise. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But consider it something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor иствуд agree with this. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with that boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when the silence, and the way we do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> While it is unclear how will apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player football team and the student public college in the south-east of Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, which has been the fact that soon will be quite legitimately on the entire territory of the state: possession of small portions of marijuana and tubes, in which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that once he was in September with friends in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, for each of which owe a fine of $100 - and set the date of trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;with US treated as criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But whether he was a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already charged in hundreds of cases, here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations already ceased to nominate people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small amounts that will be seen as legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors took the decision to consider the case, associated with marijuana, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Mountain West vote for something to prevent the emergence of in their places, the new state shops licensed to sell marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;all this is growing so rapidly that I don&apos;t even know what to expect,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of supervisors in Washington also ozadacheno pochesyvayut head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will shape the rules for determining the order of licensing cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it is all you need to do until December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in regulating the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;in Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; - explains Brian Smith, a spokesman for the Council on regulation of production and sales of alcoholic products in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, recognizes Mr. Smith, than to nominate any proposals and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;we have no real precedent on which we could be,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of &quot;adequate access&quot; to a licensed marijuana prohibition on trade with it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;it is especially difficult to place the licensed trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates e-mail message that the city prosecutor&apos;s office no longer will attract people, age of 21, the responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations &quot;from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> County prosecutor Weld&apos;s role in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor&apos;s office will continue to attract the responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage use of its people to undergo treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently 119 persons indicted in storage and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;our duty is to pursue for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,&quot; said Mr. tank in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction has been patchy, even in places like rural Mesa County, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Grand Junction police, the biggest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take charge of already open cases related to the storage of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to ensure compliance with the law as long as he doesn&apos;t change is our duty,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of residents of the state of Colorado who took part in the voting, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the confused reaction of residents in different places of the state&apos;s economic relations local authorities to experiment with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;the district prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier,&quot; explains Sean makalister, claims, the lawyer representing the interests of convictions for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;they are so long persecuted people for it, that now may not truly come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in the scale of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time, they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Marijuana legalization supporters hope that the Department of Justice in this matter. </seg>

<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local saying like &quot;let&apos;s put Bao (булку) in the stove,&quot; to laugh at birth rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH&apos;s, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they would draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music, so people have fulfilled their national debt. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world on the continuation of a similar, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government attempted to do a lot of things, such as the launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (blitz-visits). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The child&apos;s 1.2 </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not take it so lightly, because it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens&apos; enthusiasm for the birth of the greater number of children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and maternity and provides tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is currently on the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the national population, says that the reason for the improved education &quot;and&quot; a wide range of career opportunities. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;this allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of&quot; family, &quot;she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes social norms contribute to the growth in the number of young Bachelor or Bachelorette and long delays marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the population reduction, causing outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore have Web sites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which criticized for maintaining salaries at a low level and unwillingness to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Immigration growth also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party Singapore received the worst result in the election since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While falling fertility has known impact on the nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to not built up so much of a small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Guide on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that you can build in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments of 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to holostomu lifestyle and deprive incentive developers who want to build a big family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of this company El developers, says that their &quot;shoe box&quot; sold much faster than the more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash income increases. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had been a major embarrassment, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too perenapryazhennye </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of the national birth rate increase, after talking with singaporians, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;people are very over-stretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and due to this many people this delay,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;but for me it is important to have their own money and time,&quot; says another young man 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that prevent them to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as the government would neither encourage their citizens to birth children, in fact, as regards procreation, the last word remains for singaporians. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Personal offline - personal online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about private property or the &quot;sphere of privacy, which have the right to protect from any interference.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2661"> &quot;social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with their friends on the rapid,&quot; - he points out. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Without thinking, that never would have received a request from the unfamiliar faces. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Would not be with someone who would have recommended that the stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest admits that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends. </seg>

<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, not removed account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;only included confidentiality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up the account safe way. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, the boy would be uploaded photos of friends in the uncomfortable or confuznyh situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would have done it, if people don&apos;t like me or if I want to. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;although I know that this cybermobbing&quot;, &quot;he confirms. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marjelos Porras, English and an expert on education and training, believes that, in order to send children and teenagers, you need to understand that the goal of social networks - to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicates that the Academician Mark prenski, master Pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still have to learn,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a certain criteria that you can or can&apos;t distribute, publish or speak, at age, when maturity is not enough for this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;also that they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that the confidentiality of children and adolescents, is to ask questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;to tell them that they did this,&quot; useless, &quot;she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you would not be told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like the one that you published about his friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that the other publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign photos with parties, whether you ask for permission from other people, to mark them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more thing, all you need to know, what are you doing in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same should be in social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need to heads of families conscientiously read the policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding each of the items, they have good reasons for talks with children about the prerequisites of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;for example, age and the fact that allowed to distribute or to publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson &quot;don&apos;t talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the oldest &quot;HIV patients of the hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) already 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe - too little existed then treatment options, too little knew about the disease, too jaundiced treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even so, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had been cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those times have AIDS was the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome, and to do it, not worsening quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> It, a come most so far, won when the of fewer than the and for no damaged knowing damage about your infections of the these, immune system истощил &quot;of its and </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the patient&apos;s survival, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV-branch of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> An infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy of those who are not drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when informed about 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the age of 25, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; - he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today in an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), is also true that since AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Летальные &quot;deaths why still has -- </seg>
<seg id="2799"> &quot;personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I imagine, so the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years we have not had the lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don&apos;t know about his infitirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led a devastating data: &quot;nine out of ten patients come, when already have something opportunisticeskaya infection; what we need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate, so it is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked for it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal opined specialists and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi&apos;s mother, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that die, and didn&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;times are still die, I&apos;ll be better nadiratsya three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I nourish myself well, doing exercises, take drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, care about themselves and about another person,&quot; - Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with the Milenio Jalisco, to prompt his statement of those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, is fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Even if spamdexing is, if the risk of infection, even as soon learn whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This is his message said the fight against AIDS in this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms for counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Big gap between programs in health and simple citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from of the city of Guadalajara, which started problem associated with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In places, devoted to this task, &quot;actually increased distribution of condoms, before we were one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;why did they do?&quot; is a popular issue, with echidstvo and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health workers, who did not want to hear teenagers, assured propagandist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I propose to change it inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for the function and to hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often visits the youth. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This is not to encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether the distribution of condoms is possible under his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;it&apos;s not sexy, it is better to make condoms available for those who are already practicing sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data in </seg>

<seg id="2825"> The state ranks fourth in the national rankings for new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to perinatalism path. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as the one registered a case from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision that elides debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country, which has problems with solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms, which are Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the approval of the decision June 15, Judge Harlin Hale bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firms in the face of a possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> But the decision opens the doors leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, citing the evidence of three discrepancies. </seg>

<seg id="2834"> In fact, with this goal was created a model law for the unification of international trade law, determining the arbitrator shall American Institute of Law. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an election, recognized in a critical mass of competitive manufacture debt, which had before the parent company Vitro branches, would be achieved majority needed to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, among which agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting voices branches, one way or the other lenders, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds &quot;vultures&quot; like aurelios capital, aurelios convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have achieved majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> These data omits the Court of Appeals. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, embrace a serious economic crisis, which to move the United States, by hitting the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> So far the Gonzalez family garden gratifying appeal in the court of appeal, to vote came to his plenum, i.e., five judges, because only three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the case of our failures will be charged a petition about identity, which will require a review process with the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worst of all, the court rejected the document, the government of Mexico in the role of ewcs do curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), which described the process, which should be in the framework of the law on competition, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy. </seg>

<seg id="2871"> &quot;I did a lot of roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, director-general of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s,&quot; recalls Reyes during the visit Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with his wife, Isabel true for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes is not exaggerating, making this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things, collected for his long way, evidence of this. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamon in the heart of </seg>

<seg id="2877"> &quot;it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There was joy for many years, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut Jerome минси in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, and to continue to lead became &quot;kuko&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that gin bartov, who was on his way here and he was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have for you there is a very strong player, the 6 &apos;7.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;do you want?&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2887"> By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments минси in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember how we won for the first time the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said. </seg>

<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the one that, with the pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Championships. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The team not only played once again минси, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and &apos;pikulina&apos; (Tailor Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) &apos;tonito&apos; colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &apos;кихоте&apos; Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90 year due to a knee injury. </seg>

<seg id="2898"> His performance at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>

<seg id="2901"> Who was the best puertoricancem leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a very difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalma, armandito Torres. </seg>

<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the guys travel and play too much, and it&apos;s unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I can see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for governors, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>

<seg id="2965"> If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of &quot;the end of the world&quot; in this semester, theoretically the latest in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In templsk University associate professor Barry Wacker reads the course &quot;media, culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week the students explore apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;we analyze why these ideas with time,&quot; he said, and the way that offer the hypothetical scenarios, causing certain human actions. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they interact with examples from real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell students about the fact that maybe, probably, plausible, and it is impossible,&quot; said Wacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of history of Latin America&apos;s Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is called simply &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;we do not add &apos;2012&apos;, to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in the case of the end of the world,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent destruction,&quot; students should learn to cook projects and to take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse that students leaves no other choice but to work &quot;to the very night, in which presumably will come the end of the world,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;the place was for two hours,&quot; said Restall about its course for students with high scores on average, which did 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received e-mail messages for many weeks before the start of the semester from the people, who asked whether there is still space. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I like to see what people are doing, to console himself,&quot; said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of sociology and religion from Haddonfield, New Jersey, the Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a question of consolation or its absence. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will vecoesa, 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that looked all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I&apos;ve never heard about the course, which would be taught,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I like it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor is not said that believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;our first project touched Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we his discredited,&quot; said Julie zeglen, 21-year-old student at the University of templsk from West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has a few centuries, where people react to changes around himself, predicted the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;in other places people don&apos;t think about it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Mainly in anglogovoryaschem world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty would henceforth, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about a course about the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;the Philippines did not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, referring to the appeal court. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noticed that for a long time about many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, &quot;people immediately begin to think about the next date&quot; or philosophizing that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers blithely refer to this date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Some said that are going to go to parties &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;may be, call someone from friends, to laugh together,&quot; said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication. </seg>
