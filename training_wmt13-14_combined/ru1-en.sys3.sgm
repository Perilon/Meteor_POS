<seg id="167"> between the leading manufacturers of aircraft inflamed the Bitter dispute about the width of a tourist class seats on the Distant flights, setting the tone for the fierce confrontation on Dubai aviation exhibition in this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute rotates around the width of seats available on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always are in the focus of attention of the airlines, with the volume of issued to them space plays a key role in the statements of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered Sas Airbus and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week urged to introduce an industry standard, which would lead to the width of the seats at lEast 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class lounges, but its main competitor of the American Boeing says it should solve airline. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The argument is at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales more major versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft, and in the event of 17 - November 21, are expected to be potentially record orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Integration of the rear part of the aircraft is especially the sitting, whether 9 or 10 people to a number of - takes a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new projects “mini-airbus ”. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing argues that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class more than 17 inches, placed on 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will be transported in the economy of 350 seats on the width of the 18 inches, located on 9 in the series. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Giants aircraft manufacturing often exchanged impacts on technical issues by advertising in professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> And now Airbus drawn directly to the public before Airshow in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She has demonstrated, which may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide representing three people in the restaurant, adpressed to each other, under the name of &quot;you would agree on is that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> “Boeing offers long haul flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft &quot;, - said the head of sales Airbus John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With the change in diet people are gaining weight, but aircraft seats are not changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the distance wide-glider Boeing 747 asked standards of modern Distant trips and abroad century weight average American men Aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the department of health of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Girth waist, the average American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data, health services of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus stated that her competitor adheres to the concept of the seats in the 1950s, when the average girth waist those recently called “Reactive public ”, was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus says ordered a study indicating that an inch in width seats improves the quality of sleep to 53 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing argues figures Airbus in the sizes of seats and says that the manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how to airlines to find balance between Tariffs and amenities. </seg>

<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want US to decide for them that will bring profit. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For passengers question is to increase the space on the sides, but for Suppliers it is increasingly becoming factor that may affect the profit. </seg>
<seg id="189"> For this dispute is the race for orders on aircraft, estimated at lEast $700 billion on catalogue prices in the coming decades is enough to change the American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As the first reported in July agency Reuters, seat layout is exactly what stirs up competition in the battle between the latest state aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="191"> As Airbus and Boeing say about 20% increasing profitability in one place in their last twin-engine long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The characteristics of the Boeing are partly based on a comparison 10-local rows 777X with original 9-seater layout rows of constructive solutions 777. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The specific price reduced in comparison with 10-seater layout used at the present time. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason why Boeing makes this, is to Squeeze more places and make your plane more competitive in comparison with our developments&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of comfort to passengers Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say, lounges with full 10-local rows for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers Prefer dense placing which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="196"> The seat of the width of the eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view offer Airbus due to the threat from the 777-th models &quot;, - said the specialist in the Interior salon Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the runway girl network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing not supply chair, but offer catalogue of Suppliers from which the airline can choose. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Visitors to the world sellers Jets even carry a roulette to check the competing design. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus A350 offers with 10-local rows, but says that it is not sold. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a broad place aisle on some of their aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Without the support of the only manufacturer of another large aircraft, the experts say, its appeal to the new industrial standard is unlikely to “”, but may divert attention from the sales of the model 777X. </seg>

<seg id="358"> scientists have shed light on the way the movement of the tail of the dogs are connected with her mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies have shown that happy dog wag tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while worried dogs pomahivaya tail mainly in the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now, scientists say that the other members of the family of the dog may notice these Subtle differences in impact tail and react to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara&apos;m a neuroscientist, from Trent university, said: &quot;it is well known that people have the left and the right side of the brain differently in shaping stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions ”. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we tried to look at it and from other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that the same as a person, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and Vice Versa, and the two hemispheres play different Roles in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how dogs react to various poilevaya tails other dogs, researchers looked for animals, when they watched films about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Probably, very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes head to one side, and sometimes - to another </seg>
<seg id="367"> professor Vallortigara said: “we showed the dogs video with dogs, or naturalistic version or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we can manipulate the movement of the tail, and to direct the tail more to the left or right&quot; </seg>
<seg id="368"> when animals have seen that otherwise nothing expresses the dog was the tail to the right (from the point of view of shuffling tail dogs), they were not completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they saw that the tail was mainly to the left (again from the standpoint of shuffling tail dogs), their heartbeat uchashchalos&apos; and they looked overanxious. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that the dogs deliberately communicate with each other and with the help of these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from my own experience, what the movements they should worry, and what is not. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He says: &quot;if there are several meetings with other dogs and often swerving their tail to one side is connected with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of the experience&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> researchers say that these results can give the owners, the vet and Tamer deeper understanding of the emotions of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="374"> An expert in the field of behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow in Veterinary school Bristol university, said that it was not the first study for verifying whether the importance for dogs left and right hand. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year, a group of scientists from the university of Lincoln found that the dog&apos;s head turn to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at one rather big dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in the other scientific work of the university of Victoria in Canada, he reported: &quot;the dogs often approached Dog-Robot when swerving its tail heading to the left, not right, instead of become overanxious, is the Opposite behavior towards Italian research ”. </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in various studies do not fully regarded animals in films or dogs-robots as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;While in different mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, many details yet to clarify and dogs is not an exception, ” he said. </seg>

<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main drivers the fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> First of all, this is the crisis of non-payments unsecured consumer credit and the mass of workers. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern is not what growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> At the present time it is completely consumption, which is almost not ease up Revolutions&quot; said the chief Economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens column, presenting yesterday quarterly report for investment bank in the russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> If inflation in 6% he will be able to provide the future demand for about the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the profitability of russian companies is falling, however, most likely, they will optimize expenses on staff. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if the wages rise by 10%, the GDP - only 2%&quot; said Mr. Column. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The company faced with the reduction of profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If she doesn&apos;t grow up, this may lead to dismissals, and the growth of unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Not to raise the salaries of the russian business can&apos;t, says chief Economist of the Barclays capital in Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To attract employees with hand or to keep current employers have to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia support ­ themselves and very rapid growth potrebiteley. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. Box, because of the extremely high rates on consumer Loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country this type of crediting does not provide. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;good for the economy of potrebiteley we no saw money does not go to the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot; said Economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem is different - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of overdue unsecured Loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> Them take mostly books people who have nothing to offer in the software. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Interest on the loan high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they often fail to return &quot; said Mr. Column. </seg>
<seg id="670"> However the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is possible crisis of non-payments unsecured Loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The director of the banking institute of HSE Vasily Solodkov now sees signs looming banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, which have the prior, were forced to raise funds of the population under the high interest rates. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, the state took on a war and started to cut interest rates, - continues to Economist. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit organizations can not to issue Loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If the state is not refuse to dumping, Russia is in a banking crisis believes Vasily Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Deprivation of licenses of several banks in recent weeks Economist considers as the harbinger of mass collapse. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;The state themselves with this situation can not do it: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for systemic crisis,&quot; warns the head of the institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But consumption growth will slow and without a crisis of non-payments, believe in the prestigious, &quot;because of the refusal of indexing wages of officials and military, laid in the current version of the project budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partially blow to the consumption will freeze reduced Tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the decrease in the inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partially: if investments not grow (and the prerequisites for this while are not present - see reference), consumption growth is slowing, confident of Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays capital has yet to see the prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> He estimated that the russian economy will Shrink by oil price below 90 USD per barrel. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to cut interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> There is a paradoxical situation: inflation fell, and banks began raising rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, the transition to the companies who targeting inflation &quot; said Clemens column. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The policy of the central bank to market rates are not affected, only affects the Interbank lending rates. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;for the central bank is the failure of all hopes,&quot; appreciated Clemens column. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Money received at auction, the central bank, the banks are not for lending to the economy and to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> as soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to go to the speculation against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working&quot; said Mr. Column and recalled that put the ruble in &quot;floating&quot; the state plans to the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But will have to either make it before, or to raise the rate of the central bank (5.5%), he said. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He estimates, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The ruble only one road - weakness, &quot;concludes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the central bank provides in finansista even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of currency corridor is not part of the policy on the weakening of the ruble, it can break the ruble is much stronger. </seg>

<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already presented plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;depending on the plan could we endorse the increased use of electronic devices very soon, ” stated FAA. </seg>
<seg id="714"> At the present time the passengers are obliged to disable your smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as soon as the door aircraft is closed. </seg>

<seg id="716"> Passengers must turn off your device again when the aircraft is reduced for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new Guidelines, airlines, whose planes adequately protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off and landing and taxiing, stated FAA. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most new airliners and other aircraft, modified so as to passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Glading, president of the association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the change. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;After the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to do this), this will be the win-win option &quot;, - said Glading. </seg>

<seg id="802"> Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="803"> This means that one passenger waiting in the queue at the flight frontier might be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next in turn can pay $100 for the same bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> About Malley said that changes to procedures on the website and at the check-in desk frontier designed to ensure that the passengers will know about collecting before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="805"> The new collection of frontier for hand baggage will not apply to summer, although the date not already installed. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Passengers are often complain of fee for baggage and other charges, but airline them love. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They claim that the processing of baggage is worth the money, and the passengers, who need this service, should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on wall street consider adding the luggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover costs on air travel after several years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> However, most of them are not touched fees for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit airlines Inc. Has introduced the first collection for hand baggage, three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant air later followed their example. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with such collection is the Hungarian Wizz air, said consultant on airlines Jay Sorensen, which closely watching extra charges. </seg>
<seg id="812"> In his evaluation of the report from December 2011, the fee for hand baggage, brings the spirit of $50 million per year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, former chief executive of the MidWest airlines, recently flew flight spirit, and it was interesting that he finds out at the gate, when the passengers encounter with an unusual collecting spirit in hand baggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> “the process of landing was the smooth from those that I saw in his career in the airlines, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fight at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, “and landing was rapidly&quot; </seg>
<seg id="817"> frontier should also for spirit in respect of the charge of $2 for coffee, tea, these Pops or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier stated that the passengers who get these Pops or juice can leave yourself all bank and that topping coffee will be provided free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> She still will be giving free water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> Us Airways a short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but has rejected this seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airlines has not followed their example. </seg>
<seg id="821"> The initiative frontier presented on the payment for the hand baggage when passengers not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last resort to attract customers to your website. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airline pay online sellers tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for every one ticket. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This gave all airlines incentive to encourage the passengers to buy tickets directly from them, and not to apply to the tourist online agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> However, frontier went further all in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September, she began to give two times less miles flying passenger often our clients, who have bought tickets through the online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday, she cut premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of the trip. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, a trip to 1000 miles from the frontier, bought the online travel agency, would get 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, customers can choose place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> The frontier is the base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but her business is reduced and becomes unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenues decreased by 9 percent, and flight opportunities decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday, the Parent company of republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic is trying to improve finance frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline. </seg>

<seg id="867"> She added that a man is fully recognized their guilt. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Parents intersexuals children can choose “an indefinite Paul&quot; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany was the first European country, which recognized the third floor in children born with internal reproductive organs of intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="870"> The newborn will no longer have to assign a male or female sex. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require from parents to call any Paul of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;unidentified&quot; in their evidence about the birth. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of the law was to pressure from the parents, who can take hasty decisions about operations for assigned gender newborn and counter discrimination intersexuals people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One intersexuality people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I&apos;m not a man and a woman&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> I stay created doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Approximately one of two thousand children, born annually, is neither a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis “human sexual development ” is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, HANAGAMI (ovaries or testes) or unusual developed internal reproductive organs. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Wallace Simpson, probably, was intersexuals. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identity is still insufficiently understood, but most experts in the United States said that, if the floor can not be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign to it than to wait and to track the psychological and physical development of the child before the surgery, if at all this happens. </seg>
<seg id="879"> The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in the problems of gender identity, said that the new german law &quot;sounds like a good idea&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> Intersexuals children creates Ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;some people have life-threatening disturbances, which require the surgical intervention, however, the majority of children them is not present, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign to the floor without operation and then see how developed personality. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science of how the child will develop a gender identity, not very precise. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nobody can answer questions about why it is happening. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It&apos;s like the mystery about why people are a homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report, sent to the European commission in 2011, describes intersexuals people as different from transgender or transgender because of their condition relates not to gender, and by their biological structure, which is not only not to man&apos;s nor the female sex, and a typical for both at the same time or not is not for one of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sexual features, such as the muscle mass distribution of the scalp, chest and physique; the primary sexual features, such as reproductive organs and the genitals, or in the structure of the chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also gives a general idea of discrimination faced by intersexuals and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as on the level of harassment, violence and crimes on grounds of prejudices. </seg>
<seg id="889"> The boys with gender needs now there is a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults to male or female or &quot;the third floor ” in its official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, 52-year-old resident Australia norri May-Welby became the first in the world the man acknowledged “asexual &quot;, defended in a court of law on the preservation of“ Vague &quot;sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the ministry of internal affairs, in german passports will be the third denotation in addition to m and f -- x, i.e. Intersexuality. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In the neighboring France gender issues still cause contradictions, according to a news release on channel France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this pronounced Catholic countries signed the petition for exemption &quot;gender theory ” of school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The American website Catholic online also expressed disagreement with the german law, writing that &quot;in the situation, when the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a matter of choice, and the sexual activity -- no, we flip another two pillars of civilization ”. </seg>
<seg id="896"> A mother of the newborn from Maryland also reported the website baby zone, that she would have to children installed the floor at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> “raise the child is quite difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you don&apos;t know the floor of the child,&quot; she said a website for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, of children born with the male and female reproductive organs, called hermafrodite is named beautiful Greek god, who had the characteristics of both Sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And yet only ten years ago the medical community perceived gender as a sheet of paper on which you can just delete, and then again to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many dispute Ethical reasons for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and the doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to him the floor when will grow. </seg>
<seg id="902"> “in the middle of the 20th century, it was called&quot; pressing the Psychiatric case &quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When children are born, you are not called the psychiatrist - you called surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John mani from at Johns Hopkins university, who believed that gender easy to change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He introduced to appeal the term “gender identity&quot; and argued that the signals of the environment, including social - how parents are raising a child, - interact with genes and hormones of the child in determining whether a person is considered to be a man or woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in the one case of 1966, known as the “John/Joan ”, his theories are in question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the unrestrained circumcision, fully castrating child by removing also his testicles, and raise it as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> “mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but this was not the case, ” said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When the boy was about 15 years, he became a boy and a married woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But in 38 years he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model ”. </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, people who survived these operations on a sex change, said about yourself, &quot;with the outcome&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> such was the case and Jim Bruce,, a writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but genitals intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The doctors could not determine precisely there was whether he has a big clitoris or small penis and were convinced that he would never be able to live a full life ” “men. </seg>
<seg id="915"> However shortly after his birth in 1976 the external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He went to female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I know that I am not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was Unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> At 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But being in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded medical documentation. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he found out it was awful. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which does not give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genital organs. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Having got to know the truth, he became a man getting testosterone injections and removing his chest. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Operation made his fruitless. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today he upholds the other in the organization called interface project, trying to lead normal perception of people with intersexuality. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California law association story for informed choice, concerned that the german law “urges earning shortcuts and stigma&quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;many activists are concerned that the german law will encourage parents make hasty decision and to give the child&quot; an indefinite sex &quot;,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid that it will contribute to the intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to give a male or female sex, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we haven&apos;t seen would behave this law, so all we can do is to build assumptions. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults make choice in favor of the third floor&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> “adult people should have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The german law implies appropriation of its birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This battle, in which little children should not enter at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions regarding their own body. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arlene Barats, mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh, has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps to hundreds of other people in a support group, said that the german law &quot; support ” as parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Daughter Barats, Katie, born with male chromosomes, but it is a violation of sexual development called “the syndrome of full dead to actually androgen ”. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Since its androgen receptors incorrect work, the Katie developed female signs. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has the vagina, but not the uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, in 29 years, Katie married and passes studies on psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> In Spite of the fact that she Barren, she hopes to become a Parent through the adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood methods. </seg>
<seg id="943"> The law gives parents time, not to take any hasty decisions for themselves&quot; said Barats. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He gives them the time to make any analysis and understanding of the situation, as well as the period of time before they write “male ” or“ female ”. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In this case you in order - grow baby love child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a child, and you feel Joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We don&apos;t need to hastily to do the operation that irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the excitement that drives the parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> In the end he decides what Paul him or her more comfortable -- and it&apos;s wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own. </seg>

<seg id="1919"> George Caravan: the gap with Europe gives not choice </seg>
<seg id="1920"> another day, another horror story of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we warn that independent Scotland to join European zone of free movement, as a condition of membership of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> It&apos;s turn stories about the passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire Adrianova along the wall. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits from the more free navigation through the rest of Europe, though -- that predictably is not appeared in headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> No one is also pointed out that the EU member states to spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as they it is convenient. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Since Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with the requirements will be cheap concession to Brussels in return for what he really wanted to from the scottish people. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So it&apos;s not&apos;s worth considering story. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And this old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard &quot;duck ” that&quot; independence means passport control ”, at lEast 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> And yet there is an interesting point, the lost when paraphrase of ancient fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why have an independent Scotland must execute orders of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> This is the real European news: the great war plan unite Europe has stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With euroclinicum project &quot; Europe &quot; officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Throughout the European union party opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single exchange, is accelerating. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany party euro-skeptics “alternative for Germany &quot; is founded only in this year -- appeared out of Nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September the federal elections, thus essentially expelling“ free Democrats ” (an equivalent of our “Liberal Democrats&quot;) of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There was always internal opposition to plan the federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a Turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European central bank, and the Chains imposed on the national economy through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to the idea that the project &quot; Europe &quot; has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis little is connected with the fact that national governments operate at excessive deficits budget - this was true only for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In fact the Eurosystem blocked their members on exchange rates, beneficial for german exporters, is that the german politicians and want to save. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency South Europe is in advance at a disadvantage in production capacities in comparison with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only saving remedy is to cut wages and public expenditures that actively supported by the Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> For the current problems of the budget and exchange is deeper problem productive capacities of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of the complex of measures on the “green ” energy embedded Brussels, - cipher for subsidizing of french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is a European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> This Paralithodes Adverse price terms, as we have seen in greengate. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing of wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory cheap U.S. Shale over the European Petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result of the brewing rebellion, especially in France, once the an avid storonnie EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war, the french political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put the Paris on a level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin no longer needs in Paris as in the see of political legitimacy, and has already made its own economic policy of the Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> The result is the right to be against the EU party Marin le pen, the national front ” just won a decisive additional elections, throwing the ruling party Socialists in the third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;front&quot; now is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - early warning British incoming about what should not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right-wing automatically impact in favor of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What makes le pen with his newfound popularity among french white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections in the EU in the next year to create block in the European parliament against the EU and against the common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If -- and it is very likely -- opposed to the EU party will receive support in the elections, the block will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my opinion: soon growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU will not go away, but he again become something like a loose “Europe (sovereign) of nations&quot;, who liked to general de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and several dependent from her economies can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I assume that the United kingdom distances himself from this project, hoping to close to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that the United kingdom will be left without attention in the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In what position it leaves Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become the region (in fact) small England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland would Succeed in the framework of a more free European agreement provided that we will keep its currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in neviditelny Europe nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise we should consider the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The government of the scottish national party in Scotland is -- strangely - the most successful political movement in Europe aimed against austerity measures, received an impressive majority votes in 2011, thanks to the objections against Cuts costs, the offered (and implemented) labour Chancellor of the treasury of Aleister darlinga and subsequently caused by a coalition of tori and liberal Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Scotland would now ridiculous to vote for independence, only to take measures austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> there is no evidence that the guilty hormones or other chemical substances </seg>
<seg id="2047"> experts believe that the obesity Epidemic may be one of the starting mechanisms of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> the tendency to early puberty not so expressed boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> the former correspondent CNN Pat Etheridge - Journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and issues of family. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Should there be Frightened by the mother, if the her daughter is beginning to form the Beginnings of brEast and grow pubic hair in 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children ’ s endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are distributed among American girls and represent the new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time, calming parents -- usually it doesn&apos;t mean the rapid advance of full puberty, ” said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Obvious signs of development, such as increasing the chest, pubic and of the axillary hair and body odor, appear before the girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menses) over the last four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;After the chest is beginning to develop, passes at lEast two or three years before menarche &quot;, - said Kaplowitz, is also the author of early sexual maturation girls: how to Cope with this common problem&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2057"> time is the most accurate checking how sexual maturation will Prosper. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> There is a discussion about what constitutes an onset of puberty, but is considered to be &quot;premature&quot; when brEast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will be or is that a pediatrician may monitor carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> The more rapid the progression of can serve as the basis for analyses the endocrinologist, to prevent serious problems such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are procedures to delay the early menstruation and prevent another Consequence: premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations on drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplowitz careful with drugs, but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and feelings of girls, that they are different from the other girls. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2065"> another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want to have them very young daughters were menstrual period. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They worry about the risks of pregnancy or even about how they Cope with questions of hygiene, ” said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, her daughter menstruation which began in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally is ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> She came home from school same phobic and pissed what she first among their girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are many advertised theories about the reasons of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that guilty hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual the statements of the mass media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> The boys -- as girls -- sexual maturation comes before. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplowitz argues that assumption, which has the largest weight is obesity Epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001 he helped to carry out a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the terms puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country African-American and latin American girl, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white peers. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> All over the world on early sexual maturation, apparently affects all: from the economic conditions and climate change to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another mystery: although boys hair on the face and pubic appear at a young age, a tendency to complete early sex it not so expressed as girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors, participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The emergence of acne and pubic hair meets even in infants and children of the nursery age. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> “we must be careful about how we define the onset of puberty&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children ’ s endocrinologist in children ’ s hospital gorieb in the Morristown, new jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to speak with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;This may mean an earlier than expected, conversation,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you can keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls, who blossom early, you need to confirm that even when this happens than before, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2517"> These devices, tracking every PROUTEAU motorist mile and Convey this information officials, are located in the heart of the controversial attempts to modernization of the obsolete system of financing of highways of America, made with bodies of Washington and the state. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually a boring arena planning highways suddenly spawned intense debates and picturesque alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarian joined the environmental groups in lobbying of the government the right to use the small drawers to track the number of priezjaesh you miles, and perhaps even of where you them pass - and then use this information in the tax accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The movement of the drinking tea in shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American civil Liberties union also deeply concerned about the and raises a number of questions regarding the private life. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And although the congress until may not agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They do ponder as over the next decade, you can go to the system in which drivers are paying for each mile road, which they are travelling. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists have already taken on testing these black boxes, part of which have the function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Is it really necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;This is not a question on which we can have the right of choice, ” said Hassan Arata, executive director of the association of the governments of Southern California, which is preparing plans for the beginning of the track the state authorities miles, priezjaesh each Californian motorist, by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Will change in the way we pay the taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The technology for this already have. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The necessity for this problem is the lack of funds at the government fund the construction of highways, financed through taxes that americans pay at the petrol stations. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> The americans don&apos;t buy as many gasoline, as before. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars drive more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, not Rises for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> The policy does not want to raise taxes even for one penny at high prices for petrol. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;The tax on gasoline simply impossible to save, ” said li manic, an expert on transport policy at the university of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In his state of was recently installed on cars 500 tracking devices for testing the system mobilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;This will be the best alternative in the long term, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Nerds call this mobilnoy user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> It is no wonder, that this idea attracts urban liberals, because with taxes can be changed character of the trips to reduce the load of roads and emissions of Greenhouse gases, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> The authorities in California look narrowly to this system in the course of the development of Strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious the laws of that state to fight global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, member of the house of representatives of the Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transport committee of the chamber, said he also considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Adherents of the free market in the “reason ” also love the fact that will make the drivers to pay for each mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It&apos;s not just tax, which will go into the black hole, ” said Adrian Moore, Vice president of political affairs reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People directly pay for what they are. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the United States, which in 2011, called on congress to move in the direction of mobilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The U.S. Senate approved in the last year, a pilot project value of 90 million dollars, in which it was attended by about 10 000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, the leaders of the house of representatives rejected the proposal is due to fears of rural state legislators, from Voters that in Everyday life, often to travel a lot of miles to get to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several states and cities, however, are on the way to independently. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The Biggest enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country attracts 5000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon be pay state for miles driven instead of tax on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada pilot project has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York he considered. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois test it on a limited basis with the participation of the trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> And the coalition I-95, which includes transport departments 17 states East coast (including Maryland Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies, as they will be able to carry out these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept was not universal recognition. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can keep track of each of them step. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;concerns about the&quot; big brother &quot;and similar things is a big problem, ” said Aladdin Khan, head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency in the department of transportation of the state of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> It was not what we wanted people. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When the tests were underway, the American civil Liberties union in Nevada had warned on its website: “very easy will transform these devices in a full-scale tracking devices ”. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably grow to store records about Everyday movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is one of the several states, where we are difficult search for cheap technology, which would allow the authorities of the state to the calculation of priezjaesh car miles, but without the information about the time and place. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you can do it&quot; said Khan, society will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The search for this technology led some agency state to a young company in California called true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Initially, this company has been promoted in collecting taxes state. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She wanted to go out on the emerging market of the type of insurance, in which drivers are paid based on the run. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the device, which she tests, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloadable using a modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more likely to do this, if you&apos;re not their speed and not spent their location,&quot; Ryan said Morrison, executive director of the true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There is much less expensive and less Obsessive ways to do this. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon designers experiment with the provision of the drivers of the various options. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can choose the device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they may not refuse from the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, which drive all the inhabitants of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places are hoping to sell an idea cautious public, forcing the device to do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York city transport officials seek to develop nalogooblozhenie device, which will also accept payment for interest garage space, to provide “pay as ride it ” insurance and collect pool of data about the speed in real-time from other drivers, which motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> “motorists will involve the benefits they offer &quot;, - said the document of urban design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers transport systems, however, think about is not whether all the talk about mobilnoy paying just a huge a distraction. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In the urban transport commission in the Bay of San Francisco officials say that congress could very easily overcome bankruptcy of trust fund the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> Additional a one-off or annual tax would charge drivers hybrid cars and other persons, whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to they paid their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery intervention, when all you need to do is take aspirin &quot;, - said Randy rentshler, director of the commission on law and public relations. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things. </seg>

<seg id="2722"> It discussed the state regulation of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> From 2008 to 2012 the russian beer market has decreased by 18 percent, because in recent years in the country there is considerable increase of regulation of the brewing industry in part of the production and sales of beer - drink with a slight alcohol content&quot; said listeners Schoeps. </seg>

<seg id="2735"> What will the construction of TPU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> every year the capital authorities promise to arrange more the transport interchange nodes (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Up to 2020. It is planned to enter into operation 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> What actually becomes the project was our correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago near metro station &quot;Smolensk&quot; Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line was building a fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> It stated that goes arrangement transport interchange node. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> It was all very strange, because the next to &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport does not stop and, consequently, then it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To get to the nearest trolleybus stops on the garden ring, one must overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through karmanitski lane. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now the &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost all finished. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Disappeared flower stall, demounted stand for newspapers and asphalt before entering a paving stones. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> That&apos;s the whole transport junction. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport-interchange nodes are plane and capital, &quot;explains the press service of the municipal department of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Capital TPU while are not present. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> And Planar include the construction of the parking, conclusion of commercial objects, hindering the passengers movement, the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Actually, plane TPU even do not transporters, and professional blagoustroena from department of overhaul of the city of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Transport junction is not necessarily a complex construction, &quot; says the director of the institute of economy of transport and transport policies of the higher school of economics, Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes it&apos;s a roof over your head and board, alerting about the time of arrival of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> So, for example, the metro station &quot;establishment&quot; recently opened a full-fledged Planar locations node. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Let without shelter, but with perehvatyvaet car parks and board, mark, when he Cometh bus. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of a number of officials recorded at TPU all that neither drowning man. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Still in 2011, the municipality of planned to build all about everything 151 node, of them 59 with capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now the plans before 2020 are up to 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> 150 of them promise to give back in this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although in the city there is the development of TPU, not indicated no quality criteria, &quot;states Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization&quot; the city and transport &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report on the number of objects, but the quality of transfers on each of them often worse. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - the time savings in transplantation, secondly - convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all, the ability to change the type of transport, not leaving the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow the same under the arrangement of TPU often goes exactly the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> A vivid example of the metro station &quot;VDNH&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Before suburban buses with Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance in All-Russian exhibition center. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now they have a stop on the Opposite side of the street yaroslavki cosmonauts. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Further from the metro, much further from monorail, but closer to the residential houses. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The gift that people do not want to bus station under the windows, and complained in all possible Instance. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital TPU in Moscow somehow not immediately unlucky. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them started to build five years ago near metro station &quot;Planernaya&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> the project aims to was to become a model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And really is the model of the locations node, extremely left to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, there are platforms for buses, shed, not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of the parking spaces. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> True, Khimki Trolleybuses produced in Belarus # 202 and # 203 in Moscow at the place was not fundamentally. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> It&apos;s been pushed away from the metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But the place under the trade more left. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> One only clothes 32 shop, and in general there are almost all - from pet supplies to show. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well, in fact, suddenly whom of the passengers of the bus will need buy in the way a new car? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> We have, as they build capital TPU, will always get the shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently the situation reached its logical finish when part of the parking decided to give at the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Planernaya&quot; among marked on the floor parking places is street trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, Spices, Chinese jeans, nerusskaya speech and the guards, grinned poglyadyvaya on our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Locations node finally turned into Bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The fact is that before the metro station &quot;Planernaya&quot; was the market, but his demolished. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> And in the prefecture traders regretted and putting on intercepting parking interchange node. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Still due to high prices are always there is empty. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Now the funny that the market was demolished in order to build on its place... New Planar TPU. </seg>
