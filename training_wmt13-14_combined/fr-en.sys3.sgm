<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat voter fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Centre sees it as a myth, affirming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Indeed, the Republican lawyers have been identified by 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult for the registration process or to vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained momentum after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new Republican officials in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Accordingly, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce periods for advance voting, erased the right to register as voters on election day and withdraw to citizens with a criminal record their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state requires voters to present a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state to ask such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> If empressèrent republican authorities to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards as the map of health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, lack of photo identification issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain the ID required. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students, voters considered more Democrats voting for candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters for the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Moreover, Republican lawmakers have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 dropped 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period to vote by mail. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they accounted for 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same was true with Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They accounted for only 11 percent of voters, but 24 percent of people who voted by mail. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, whites who were 76% of voters accounted for 46% of the electorate voting by mail. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course legislators Democrats and their supporters objected strongly to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the laws the more controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which cause unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to have firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one, found a difference of mortality among patients who were screened and those who had not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40 percent more likely to have an extension if it is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend that the test from 50 years ago, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American males are also at greater risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once they have detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers, and others who are indolents. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to impress the patient&apos;s level of risk of his cancer, by offering options, not necessarily by treating prostate cancers that do not harm life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who it detects cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> They will suggest to make the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it accurately determines the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend that when even pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether it should go or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Preventing illness </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50 per cent&quot;, says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> By contrast, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many remain also totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> That night to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Just today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec&quot;, says the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also promotes the onset of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer&quot;, ajoute-t-on. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommended limiting consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too much, it raised the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Also Who, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by burned, drying or salaison can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;In the past can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer&quot;, explique-t-on. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, are not conclusive at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was a decrease the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Spending a screening test, it does not give cancer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson shelled </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson likely created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> They believed that the Higgs boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of anything in the universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the latest particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;least worst&quot; explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and she is very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly clear. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose, all the same, whether it is the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law inevitably unavoidable that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you&apos;re going to get hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But even if particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that she, too, such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;rule out&quot; roughly at some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, physicists rank the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, there are good citizens appointed shutting, who wisely adhere to the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move bosons, a dirty Gaza anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they may well find themselves in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons then split into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley Laboratories: the mésons, that we shall not here, and the &quot;particles strength&quot;, by which the major forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs boson would somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons-là, it must be noted here, are not all of the bugs as exotic as it might seem. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a Higgs boson extraordinary banality: the photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot; who is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerating or changes direction, this &quot;disturb&quot; the electromagnetic field in that particular spot, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;inconvenience&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared and ultraviolet rays, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons &quot;bearers of force&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same goes with the Higgs boson, except for the fact that this is a different field, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; that the Higgs boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, we have to reach a very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could wrinkled the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like the magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never himself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what does &quot;can bring&quot; all these research, asked Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the MOH. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also several earnestly hoped that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and fill some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80 percent of the matter in the universe (re-oups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But there was no such gaps at CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Take: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the Bell Laboratories, do not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They see scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, has already told us the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsés) in 1962 - initially lasers were seen as a &quot;gimmick of lab&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation surrounding research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during its work in perspective. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not at all its original intent, now serves &quot;eye&quot; to all digital cameras of the world, and it won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Commission die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir tried to for a closer look. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer who rongeait left him with a break of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago&quot;, he said, wry mi-raisin, lying in his bed at home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, as housekeeper, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, you can&apos;t be prepared for it&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is his masterpiece: a huge weakness that prevents go only to the toilet, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Aware before a sexy lunch, he agrees to get help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, they sometimes smile, talk to strangers who gathered around him, give him his medication, offer a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I am cure diarrhea, it is humiliating&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learned that a man, standing problem&quot;, says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back at the stage of the Child, for some people, is a humiliation unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the person&apos;s ability&quot; to accept the decline, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people involved in palliative care, great moments are at the heart of this downturn. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them sufferer so-called curative care &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is dying &quot;conscious and stifled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have lost my wishes in life&quot;, she says, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She still expected in the coming days, a last visit to his son come to Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> To Victor-Gadbois, it cares, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and assistance to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are the palliative care, given when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make their lives more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 residents. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when we know that we end up all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions &quot;, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> That the physical comfort, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The dying, it will provide care to mouth the brandy or Pepsi, according to demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, it served beer to Mr X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son, who completed the beer to the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It helps the families as well as patients&quot;, says Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Home Victor-Gadbois, the days are too &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Alongside an old man of 93 years who is relishing his final assembly of family in the courtyard, propped up on pillows while it is taking the rap in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two young children, after having tried everything possible to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, there are still three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years&quot;, worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrived from their homes, 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great gap in health care that worried many physicians specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto, signed by luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, &quot;I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency in great pain, and they do what is necessary for the relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists are struggling on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I would have to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stop to beat me &quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that I was over! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients seeking to die thank the caregivers of not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely empowered in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of palliative care at home in Quebec, patients would be unwilling to treatment for pain in 8 percent of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, who returns to lull the patient until the time of his death, sporadically, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend not to hear that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean &quot;I want you euthanasiiez me&quot;, it means &quot;I want to be relieved&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> This story was made possible by a grant of journalism of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Major property scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of roads, construction contractors, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a great &quot;system&quot;, a mixture of construction industry, government officials, politicians, unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry&quot; which was very expensive to taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It&apos;s funny how the system crumbles since that we took the major ways&quot;, &quot;Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through investigation on the substance of wrongdoing related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, made only begrudgingly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report was &quot;on a direct link between industry, covert funding of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he says, the only Department of Transportation could have saved $1 billion on contracts&quot;, some réfrénant their instincts to collect co-payments! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already brought down two mayors&quot;, he says, hoping that it gets to &quot;demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> An anti-corruption permanent unit, established in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The anti-corruption permanent Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> More officers of the &quot;Marteau Squad&quot;, which, since 2009, led the sewer &quot;cartel&quot; of Montreal to soft pedal on the swelling of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has conducted searches in series and laid charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a town in the suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles&apos;ll, who resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Are formally charged by the engineers to roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> He caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia reversait money in Union Montreal mayor Gerald Tremblay&apos;s party. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. Zambito has sown in all directions in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He said also have organized a fund-raising illegal ex-vice-premier liberal Minister Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts which it soared costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, ex-ingénieur in public works, detailed well before the commission: in 10 years, he has received gifts of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes totaling $736 million, in exchange for contracts which it soared sewer costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials confessed to being grease the leg by pumping up 30% to 40% bills, by false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then a party organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately ignored a budget parallel fueling its boxes with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following the revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies district, east of the island, it complains in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation that eventually will be put in place, she says she &quot;pull one thread to understanding the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pinpoint the culprits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but there should be an investigative unit own in Montreal and a day before, not to see the dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As they cleaned. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but worried particularly the role of &quot;elected during the ploy&quot;, when they do not soaking in the Tammany! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Believing at 70% share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec, he &quot;:&quot; They told me that this was only a pale reflection of reality &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties but it will not change the equation, adding: &quot;As long as it is not strictly limit campaign spending, there will be dirty money in politics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and financing of political parties: &quot;You can&apos;t go and get to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by individual conscience but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Major players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I was on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also told me. </seg>
<seg id="257"> On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I didn&apos;t fire. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My debut at the centre of the INF préformation Clairefontaine during my visit, I always advanced by levels. </seg>
<seg id="262"> So you pull competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits this summer are used to compete in games to a very high standard. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> What makes a player like me want to confront and provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect among all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience and won a lot of titles with high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He played great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a comforting discussion with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I was coming out of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust that he gives me also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What is your view on the first part of the season. </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the finals with the Paris fashion. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We&apos;ll try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we will have our say in the face of very good teams in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to receive at the 8th finals return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG can become a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, PSG to have the means to make this happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we were really at heart of pocketing the championship title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it has not gone away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It has been a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has made a season even more fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think he has the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media waiting too PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is only natural that we should expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> You would completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Later, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> You can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> It is trying to implement a draft game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It has been proven in the Champions League that you could meet present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, who are not, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the final in Paris, they also enormous costs! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead in the truce! </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglect our opponents and the French championship. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, had been &quot;boostés&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can hear the smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevail. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much better that it says that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It is time for that and he proves that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He has shown everywhere he went that he was a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group are complying with the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> It is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I want to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury stopped me to garner the game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things there and I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I can achieve good games in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I was hoping for my baptism with the Azzurri. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learnt lessons from what happened in Ukraine and now needs to have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What is your view of the first months of Didier Deschamps led the Azzurri? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well positioned in the group qualification for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Like Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had reached her goal in qualifying for Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Azzurri in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good none (1-1) snatched on 16 October, Spain is a match founder? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this clash in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the opposite of the current currency transactions, based on central banks, identified and transaction processing fee among stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros) and a memorandum of exchange secured in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer file-sharing. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A thousand of Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The price of bitcoin, after peaking at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (courses are registered on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She described bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with the more successful&quot;, &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin stands out other types of virtual currency as the &quot;credits&quot;, used to make progress in a video game win by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time a central authority and control trafficking trade. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the knots of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users is in reality between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose an address different for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual encryption key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged do exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The étape-clé is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase of hachage to file, i.e. conversion of a big file in a digital fingerprint shorter and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;are&quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot;chop&quot; the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number who gives a unique footprint (lots of zeros early). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number found, other knots check easily that this is the right approach. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisibles until 100 millionth, which leaves room... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also rising in each increase of the computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already been ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins stolen in deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The loophole used is not the protocol itself&quot;, said Pierre Noizat, which has just launched paymium, a company payments in real currency Bitcoin using the network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also outlined the potential money laundering through this anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Actors weight as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins not run. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;giants&quot; balances have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged&quot;, says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this educational currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses to validate Bitcoin transactions, which costs less. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The porter manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement among merchants, who have no need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They can communicate an address that a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize&quot;, said Pierre Noizat, who also claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement challenging hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point&quot;, prédit-il. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in his report, plans to reassess the risks various, today considered high, in case of success of the currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We went to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished by considering them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign military presence, as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadis, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local insurgents, they would be more when Westerners will be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops of the Nijrab base, that I&apos;ve seen from the top of hills planted almond trees thanks to funding from French, is in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored joined Kabul without being attacked, examined by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no tidal wave of Taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their advance irresistible from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country as a result of fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban converge in the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They reversed in wheeler-dealers, seizing of government land for resale in building lots to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They face; most of them have not fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I&apos;ve heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who seized the American largesse: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have worked alongside the modern world during their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65 percent of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In cities, government schools are full, girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will provide work to these young people who will not return to the dark days of the old parties or corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas with a modern world is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities who will command be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is already to rebuild provincial militias, which will be irrelevant to the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the powerful local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been called into map, no dam is in a state, no important irrigation system is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control on infrastructure was needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that Westerners were only there to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat iron ore and copper on the spot, or means of transportation for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the My Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will be a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of French fighting troops was completed on November 20. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French Department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support for the Archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try to &quot;win hearts and minds and achieve the impossible task of match aid and offensive actions, a service&quot; civil-military actions &quot;of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, led, and carry out by a small French NGO, many public works and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> The work, known to local workforce, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, trees, protection of soil and increase cultivable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> That do we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of local, very tough in these valleys located often at more than 2,000 metres. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in Kapisa Province. </seg>
<seg id="450"> For release of the insurgency waged by foreign groups, what farmers told me to want, it should keep in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and affects them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Forcing through a constitution in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily granted full powers, he decided to play its protagonists. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everybody by surprise, it announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly approves the final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had given two months to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a first draft, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, President pushes ahead with his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a means to an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time that requires the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For President, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic, while the dispute raged throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi appears convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> As the use of a vote precipitated&apos;s ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, I retain full powers&quot;, supposedly they should end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It was a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, most Islamist, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals were still missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing it had not been able to assert their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, members replacements, have been added to the anxious, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Unsurprisingly, it is usually unanimously that the items were voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Analysts are also amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day has spoken around... prayer times, some members of the committee, claiming that the pendulum of the evil constituent was resolved. </seg>

<seg id="587"> While MPs and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, the selling of &quot;false&quot; certificates have mushroomed in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their purpose: to earn money to help their families at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December legislation came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian. </seg>

<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce exams has been supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law takes effect, human rights defenders have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: why bother? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering &quot;of slavery in work&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organized will resolve to 90 per cent of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, certify Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of help him will provide a &quot;journey&quot; in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of its tourmenteront similar for months without food and without paper and will work between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We have received many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, you take their passports, and they do not affect the salary anticipated&quot;, confirms the head of the Directorate of migration services to the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Don&apos;t disputez me, sir the officer! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many nationals of Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia said they are not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> This of course is not their fault, but their woes: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families have not even to feed their children without talking about the dress properly and equip them for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people make money when the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when you don&apos;t know the language, confient-ils. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You sense declined and stunted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> The defenders of human rights notice, however, one important aspect of the law on the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The reviews are intended solely for migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no review or official working thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or defence enter&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants say it is not so easy to get official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason? the administrative barriers and always these language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, legalizing costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you can get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we have no registration, hence the extortion cases. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea&quot;, confided to reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Dream quickly, without skimping and buy yourself a beautiful work of art&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers migrants were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of reviews of languages have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The papers forged out of a common colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to be facilitating the task of exams spent seven thousand rubles to the document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Representatives of power and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption to ensure that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give the migrant workers who have not been able to validate the test for the first time to language courses. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior is not involved in arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against carrying civilian arms. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether firing performed at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to ban the carrying of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age to obtain permits from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced in the State Duma shortly. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;turns the screws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, require to abandon this hardening &quot;foolish&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, told the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police while 1,168 1,000 crimes were recorded in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws governing the civilian arms will not deter criminals to buy on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, you can find in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of Interior says he controls the dissemination of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: the factory to the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market weapons are provided through multiple channels. </seg>

<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is both looted weapons in stocks of the police as those stolen directly to representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal guns go on sale since the military stores. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of these children are often suffered explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Previous versions appearing indicate that some of these fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit&quot;, says the former military. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, arms manufacturers are for something. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;You see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow&quot;, says one expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of black market is smuggling. </seg>

<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have estimated the approximate every source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was formed in 2011 by the Center analysis of problems and studying for public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal cases and the public data relating to weapons portals. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, say the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement officials. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of weapons on the black market is found &quot;by the lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons&quot;, explique-t-on in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of weapons from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from &quot;surreptitious searches&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A seller and consultant had requested an armoury of anonymity ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists of the illegal search; they are too old. </seg>

<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a boutique luxury&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are generally through knowledge. </seg>

<seg id="709"> I have heard of this type of patterns: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer makes the payment to the automatic. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;It gets in return a photo and instructions indicating where is hiding the weapon&quot;, says the secretary of the association &quot;Right to a weapon&quot;, Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, they can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service issued a vast network of fake sites with shovels and picks up those wishing to buy weapons to fight. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;People are jumping into the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia&quot;, he says. </seg>

<seg id="717"> The purchase of a firearm illegal, the experts say, can cost between $100 and $900. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the association &quot;Right to a weapon&quot;, you can buy a gun for 100-300 24 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It will take about a month and a half. </seg>

<seg id="721"> According to official data from the ministry, compared with the period janvier-octobre 2011, the number of these crimes has generally declined in Russia 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="722"> United States: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of American teenagers spend by working as a cashier at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against the low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or diminish rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Alongside the increase modest wages earned by employees of Walmart and home base in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector at present is not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when a freak rain balances seizing million befell America and triggering sometimes esclandres. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some employees of society Walmart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organize picketing with unions and the left-wing activists in stores the company whose products are intended for consumers and middle class. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles through the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many poorly paid workers at Walmart shop solely on their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of Walmart&apos;s products were one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products including because of low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants demonstrations of &quot;black Friday&quot; demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the employee base among Walmart affecting 9.5 dollars an hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California Berkeley show that if Walmart increased the average salary at $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1.1% more of what it spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart went any higher wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would be tantamount to 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests took place in just nine states and has borne no harm to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;black Friday&quot; continued in stores from 8 a.m. the night at midnight the following day and Walmart has sold over this period 5,000 articles in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its funds have done in all 100 million transactions for the &quot;black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company spokesperson Dan limitation said in an interview with the left-wing site Huffington Post that &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a &quot;Operation com &apos;among many others&quot; on the part of the union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Following involved!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests were held this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants cheap. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announced sell billion servings and after they don&apos;t even make you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you&apos;ve done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage set by federal law and New York is $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast food restaurants have increased over time, but not by much, on average its employees in New York are $29 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody is getting less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time where almost a quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald&apos;s after high school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself to interview employees of McDonald&apos;s who complain of having to live with the wage and sometimes have to feed their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. near the McDonald&apos;s 40th Street and Madison Avenue on the cashiers and cooks the restaurant are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also appealed to set up trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The U.S. law prohibits the administration obstruct and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration their simplifies rarely life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a union, grab the fast-food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the extraordinary staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They disagree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other demonstrations were tumultuous several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protest was the gathering around midday near the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square with the intervention of several policies local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s announced sell billion servings and after they don&apos;t even make you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you&apos;ve done honestly!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that &quot;we must all support employees fast food so that they get a fair pay and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized the event as the largest ever of the fast-food industry throughout its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people participated without counting that not all were employees of alchemy, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is still difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, nothing happens only mildly to fool the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Lately, fans of new technologies are used to collect augmented reality through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Initially, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it emerged from the meeting with the director of the interactive 3D technology group Microsoft&apos;s lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands through the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could we say in a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole remained at the moment the pixels on flat screen and sometimes the tactile. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox it sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What we also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - While the Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including the projection technology. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to break the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For that, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And start, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but is it not overstated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> You can&apos;t say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we didn&apos;t always want to inform the other of his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the machines in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to subtle gestures restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - It is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how am demanderiez-vous you miss this brew? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would with words and deeds. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - But I speak only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So, you want to force users to adjust depending on what the machine may or may not do at one point? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - No mandatory, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work for the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may include laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and that is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you don&apos;t like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on our work on the recognition 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> It would be nice to get about 8 playlists with a speed of 1,000 c / sec. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the playlists themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it added jobs for designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> We must bear in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is also much, the number of executives in the second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement are aggressive enough, and the 30 c / o don&apos;t really enough, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave to the touch sensors a regular delay treatment between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I&apos;d need a device of its kind in my work, but no longer requiring touch, to have more cadres in the second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But don&apos;t increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third is in fact a camera sensor field the usual visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the amount required of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, playing with the curve and cameras to see how it could help define the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Much as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that a view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone hands is not practice, but here&apos;s what I think: the best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality allow you to leave a cloud platform to move glasses in the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality glasses to leave you will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> He proposes - a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographiques objects in the air is more accessible than Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man but also to mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem on that critics are pointing the finger at this idea: there is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group making compared to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could very well be the addition of touch sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of interesting is the use of the second hand for support of image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It captures perfectly the pressure! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute the palpabilité to these &quot;images in the air&quot;: for example the interference of several ultrasound beams directed at a specific point the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breeze on the ends of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the wristbands worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also an axis of work with prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him believe that he feels it should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task today on which it will take longer still have difficulty: how to pretend to someone who is physically in a very small space that it works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, nothing happens only mildly to fool the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; has the project &quot;The Petersburg avant-garde&quot; dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list ultra-sélective has hosted prominent players in the arts of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the painter outgoing Metropolitan Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city is Metropolitan Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all dressed in red that can cross near the Russian Museum, Garden of summer or the holidays and vernissages connected. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The paintings of Metropolitan Kirill Miller together always crowds, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the storytellers pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Metropolitan Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also a symbol of the city, his appearance made people smile and puts them in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> It has recently taken in his hands a organ grinders who were playing and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since it was ripe for this difficult role in its existence, philosophy, and with his image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Metropolitan Kirill, why do you hit the streets in red and yellow or blue turquoise for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the red as designer specializing in the look and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in society, everything that is not gray raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to start the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy the whereabouts of my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of unofficial painters from old and new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started to become friends with the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then there has been no wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in drama, fashion, music, all genres except the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took seated Pouchkinskaya-10 housed before the work a club music and arts, with a club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: the NOM Tequila-Jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project &quot;The Van Gogh&apos;s ear&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang songs easy in own voice in T-shirts moulants, they included Igor Vdovin, composer today fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began performing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Anti-war Trakhtenberg not bad for emissions before the time of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that he has received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> &quot;D137 galérie&quot;, Club &quot;Griboïedov&quot;: these are the repercussions of the artistic Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are parties as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the past century, the time when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: that was the price &quot;The leaders of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was appointed &quot;Peintre of the year&quot;, and it was then that my reign ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they possess a valid and a very strong vision. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I&apos;m having an exhibition scheduled &quot;The Russian museum through the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a category timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it&apos;s scary to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, just disappears, the tragic tomb. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the garb total and compulsory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress that matters, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Maybe you can&apos;t give him the hand, but that it should instead be him spit the Laid To Rest. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lies will be erased by the garb. </seg>
<seg id="894"> You - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A city cultural must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else that I can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But perhaps commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art should be treated, delicate, sweet wine. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of culture is taking place. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the twisted another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it&apos;s hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket of $100 to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, we need to think about who you please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - These are people that we have laid who came to see him, it is the social and sexual side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately it is less management, money, just waning. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the essential thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the lived. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I peignais paintings that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually are those that are painted in end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, often confused ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> We say: there is the impostor, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption is not culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Metropolitan Kirill, what&apos;s missing in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone can work in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of good Tsars, it wasn&apos;t like that, the Tsars might misunderstand culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because it takes higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot;, displayed. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, there are artists who must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is far more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art is hard to push. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it&apos;s bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there is a lot of curious to see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, this is very thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make art fashionable as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project with the support of the St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or asteroid collision murderer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of shuttles with earthlings aboard go in search of a planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a large question arises: how to continue to provide our species in weightlessness or on a planet of rescue? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It&apos;s Venus and Mars&quot;, said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of State P.K., Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It has begun to address the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a century, it was conducting experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown on orbit is in no way différenciaient varieties explains. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then it was put into orbit insects, small flies drosophiles breeders. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get out a poussin quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems start. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the poussin must find a medium, it must get on its feet and start moving&quot;, says the director of the laboratory of the problems médico-biologiques Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By not finding no support, the chicks were splashing in a disorderly manner. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours, the newborns were entirely atrophying instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks do not respond to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they died just after quattre days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We his eyes widened twice, then we abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there&quot;, says Vladimir Sychev in determining the failure of the experience with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;miniature ark&quot; organic with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; embarquera that species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it has not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was still biosatellites and this is the only experience. we must do this kind of research&quot;, said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the rats of the space has given birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly into space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is no small feat. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their natural environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, the man is capable, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens possesses the abstract, he was able to create a proper emotional. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women are in space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity has more valuable. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our seagull flew and person on Earth could not say if it held after flying in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody answering this question&quot;, said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, sector pensioner rockets and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaïev. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and has even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and giving birth to a healthy offspring after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during the flight into orbit&quot;, says the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity has to seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre for preparation of cosmonauts: compulsory stage of the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in flottabilité null, cosmonauts train monitoring space walks out. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants is their real element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> To the extent that the baby is changing around nine months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb, it is easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> This is, in principle, logical, because since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little to forget&quot;, says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if the child has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, women need gravitational force weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles in the abdomen, the pelvis well very quickly, the ability to surge of baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> OK, do not know it based on simulators childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course you can prepare a baby in a special chamber, the woman arrives at the break. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then?&quot; asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the pull of Earth, the agency does not form the skeleton nor the muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t pay an infant as an adult with a special suit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of his livelihood. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience we would envisage in this case imagining the birth of a child in an alien environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté&quot;, predicts the Director of the committee on bioethics issues médico-biologiques Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in outer space is still theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time it will become a reality, when can visit their shuttle buses to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the ISC (Supreme Audit Institution) said: &quot;control of the so-called independent work (in Czech&quot; system Švarc &quot;) has failed because of the politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and legislation of quality but it is lagging behind in terms of its implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what said Miloslav Kala, the deputy head of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking among us&quot;, said Kala in his commentary on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control conducted jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot;system&quot; by Petr Nečas Švarc. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Premier said recently that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with testing; so is allowed or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go inspect to demand respect for the law&quot;, said Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the review committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in which have been likened the laws in public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was the question? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the EU legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national laws as well as a practice proper him follow. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We gathered all this and although the vetting process is not yet complete, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be &quot;tougher and better quality&quot;, however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to develop continuously rules increasingly detailed but that it was necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What this project can help you in practice and in equilibrium situation for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A joint control of this type should contribute to what we get to try to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means getting it at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork that those who seek loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained above. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the public procurement legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different style? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In terms of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a board formed a bit differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it has also in the past accounts of this kind at the level of individual states. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts of Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In terms of national legislation, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would not make comparison without any concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but you can certainly not say that it is better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don&apos;t have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is also true that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a range of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In terms of national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on the public markets, its effects are already being felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our operations of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we do checks in retrospect, it takes with a lag. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations include only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls, we launched a new tool to detect risks &quot;mismanagement&quot; with which we have scrutinised almost 14,000 public markets - where these changes will come naturally feel, because the thresholds were modified, as well as certain types of procedures for tendering and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> So what do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will prove that. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can happen is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to respect them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forcing control subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it really useful to make the law more severe this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not in this way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse, but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> So what is the solution to get out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look where we will not. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that DOS would not upset the entrepreneurs with checks on so-called Švarc system - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system Švarc prohibited or is it? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and move to demand respect for the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We will change the law and authorize it&quot;, but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities to accomplish and what, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder will be removed only for cause of faults. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are frozen in places, but most remain passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network is still largely practical, in some places with increased vigilance. </seg>

<seg id="1105"> The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to the trees that are bowed under the weight of snow to reach the road. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest said: &quot;In the concert, we want to collect positive energy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month that should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Only one of these new alarming, the kind of traps in which we love fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, rather laugh and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, you get in December a project completely unique: three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you present in more detail this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity that we prepare for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will conclude practically the moment will end the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati which lies in the Pacific Ocean, one time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Whose idea was it? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think it was my idea, then we all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to together, with the public, reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of artifacts, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys on the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world is entitled &quot;Ending world cancelled&quot; (in Czech &quot;Konec světa zrušeno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, the entendra-t-on also during these charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has no place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Hymns will join also at one point in the context of a live show, completely unique, Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The lyrics to the song were written by Tomáš Hanák that also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip Xindl X sings also... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How are you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We are working with other leading figures in the Czech show-biz, owing to the fact that we have many concerts and charity events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to involve them intensively on these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the training centre Studeo accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and that for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly with the students at the institute and offer them Jedličkův activities that interest and the fun. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička, we transférerons this project in a new building independent. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several groups of music and performers climb on stage during each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria do you have the chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to develop a program that is available to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, climb on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Get ready to other &quot;mega events&quot; of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; again, surely we will prepare a quality program with guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United States, I&apos;d like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimalist, so here you played by example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you handle the organization and logistics of your touring? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not so terrible that it looks at first. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in the electric chair whose devices must travel in the hold, naturally we trimbalons also lots of luggage and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything is more or less always well past ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of ease of access for the disabled, the attitude of the public towards the disabled and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiences until now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other locations where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow to the east all is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet known, a person moves only in electric chair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not see even as evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately there, too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what can still catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things for which we are still behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are still dependent on the efforts of the people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not very common there that many people with disabilities are actively involved in social life on this point you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary to the forefront of progress! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The public&apos;s respect and accessibility are one thing, but the situation really start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started working as a teacher at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I myself am musician (I plays the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created an activity music. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, creating links with singers and work actively to promote the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if he did not exist in the background. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can also afford to have professors of quality, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Have you designed to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Show business is full of tips that mimic each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a way, it&apos;s logical: everything new is agreed with caution and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not sick, abandoned by all, that we must take pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a full life and thrive, if the necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for all of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Does your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are described by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they are rapidly losing their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> A single, Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group opened, people come and go, you can&apos;t help it. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 21 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will be in the arena Incheba in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in to Fléda Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Late at night, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when will jointly sung the song from the band The Tap Tap &quot;Ending world cancelled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to collect funds (25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo which lies in Prague in the institute Jedlička. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, advance ticket sales of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At last week&apos;s meeting of ministers from countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became full-fledged member on November 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years has participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The map of Poland into space, much sooner. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on spaceflight; they could not meet always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like for example the conference of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled &quot;Introduction to the Astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld was reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book &quot;Introduction to the Astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagateur astronomy and Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in newspapers Polish and wrote many books this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagateur of Astronautics world-class, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925 was built in Poland a hand car designed to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> There is neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was meant to propel or curb the hand car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known about this hand car are those of the press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> According to documents held that this research had reached the stage of testing. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, plans a hunting photoélectrique rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński emerged in the press and the following year was published the book &quot;Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects had to use a military rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all projects to use of the technique rockets were led by the scientific committee interim advisory (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), who coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish company, Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautics (Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, there is talk of a society in November 1954 Issue newspaper, in which stand four more detailed articles devoted to aviation. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the Astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, society Polish Astronautics (PTA) made efforts to enter the international federation Astronautics (established in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA in became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the Federation International Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He retained his post until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA each made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the rocket two-story RM-2 were begun in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was a 1.4 metres long and weighed probably 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Following the prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development work were halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period 1962, 1965, succeeding the first rocket type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were dominated by the scale of the space for scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of device was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965 - 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first test flight of botanical garden in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently were built and Meteor-3 Meteor-2H versions. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is worth mentioning the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviétique cosmonaut program. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on the work of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No doubt it is interesting to examine the issues from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic unregulated competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are always in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and the free circulation (unlimited) of private capital ally to financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The differences in the cost of labour (wages) generate pressure on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term meaning: a producer tries by the import of goods sold cheap to resist economic competition in &quot;making it more expensive&quot; the price of competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and to increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad or buy at low prices, or disappear. the result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and thus responsibility toward the unemployment, the social costs of the state increase necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race to profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies create a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the standard of their own people in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This occurs primarily in the amendments of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to force economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and the restriction of the rights of employees in the area of labour laws. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are points for years of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already by million the number of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such salaries that the state was forced to pay a premium to reach the bare minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as helpers in the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The cost-saving measures of virtually all Member States southern EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to languish with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Now we have to ask the question: where will this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian national or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> That includes all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media say, to get bored with it, that the state cannot make equity investments in its own economy, that the command economy led to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then you can ask if private capital does not influence and, even, is not running today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the state as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer is definitely yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is a powerful lobby and present in almost all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, for the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, domestic departments lending the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The entire power does not come from the people, as saying the Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now rapidly facing the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire to the time of Caesar and Pompée&quot;: &quot;The rule had long been in complete decline and functions were attributed by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Kickbacks and corruption collapsed without limits and people went to the election with votes already sold &quot;&quot;... The honest people did not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State was 8 months without consuls &quot;... &apos;We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he had to choose an energetic man&quot;... It is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, the society is based on the profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to represent the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Therefore we have to seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> As things stand, we can see the disappearance of such systems in favor of liberal democracies such as a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current elites totally ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by history and recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to explore ways to reduce the level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is to be subject to political reforms, which will enhance capital investments of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will ever of violence and never will&quot;, says Sting in the song, whose main Fragile towards the refrain is &quot;let us not forget how we are fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my son did not want wars, there wouldn&apos;t be&quot;, said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are taking the side of Israel, claiming the right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recurrent waves of killing; after all, the current residents of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a view, located behind the curtain &quot;, to which benefit mainly tensions that persist already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individuals who were acting independently or whether they should their actions to the throne to someone who ran their actions based on previously defined goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration causing some financial powers did not happen in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families with an astronomical wealth is particularly noted the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I don&apos;t know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule it). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they have acquired the first World news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to establish links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in most of the world&apos;s central banks and preparing or conducting wars against the countries in which they have not yet of such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq five after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America of the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (governmental, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to send money home and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed to have triggered the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst of global power has led in the years 1859 in 1871 in formulating a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason introduced to the 33rd degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aimed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient to their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme was nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, to acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then suggest a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent a repetition of such crises as they arrived in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Czarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Easier for an outbreak of the second world war, bankers have left politicians create a situation of simmering conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany to sky-high war reparations and the conditions of radicalization of impoverished masses (they can then make a strong enough leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she actually) was fifth column to ignite and trigger a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war began; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had held initially; or if everything he did was planned, the fact remains that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that repairs war imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has sparked a conflagration that could spark a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers can trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the Arab population or mostly Muslim Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a big laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at international level (just see how people bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrongly in a circle of violence and where there are at the root of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> We must make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers did not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, who are keen to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expanded to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which passes 20% of all the world&apos;s oil (naval corridor has a width that 2 miles) and lead to the destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light now appears the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree a new world order&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which all new born at birth is implanted a microchip making him a fully controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;What they require all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to focus on hand or the front a brand, so that he could neither buy nor sell anyone who is not the name of this wild beast or the figure of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> You have to understand: that made sense in the figures of this wild beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> This refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: when everything is worse, call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamist students took over the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation didn&apos;t offer to the US administration of positive outcome, she couldn&apos;t abandon the Shah, because it has seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to secure the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow compounded later by the fiasco of the attempt to rescue hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate in the United States prompted a wave of solidarity and a sense anti-Iran government from emerging. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the face of Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it was occupied, escaped six employees of the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a few detours complicated, they met in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through an implausible coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a crew doing the repérages for shooting a film epic of fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requit collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magasines did rule of this film project, press conferences were held and a production company was fictitious real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film, Affleck is an unusual combination of different genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller designed realistic but also a &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy &quot;Ocean&apos;s seen, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The atmospheres are unfolding: footage of Tehran to documentary style (in the sequences are presented iconiques captioned photographs of the days of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retranscrites in the film, there is no great difference) </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to be ironic remarks. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature after the dark policeman &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first movie to Affleck who is not taking place in his home city of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put his first films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck also is showing that sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran &quot;is required&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given location, wrote a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his staff get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the wrong camera crew in the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many shares at too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to settle for a subject which was in fact little thrilling scenes, the film sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He fared well, he sometimes add some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a telephone call in America and the continued on the runway are quite far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in his character dissipated, due to the need to show too many things to too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are delightful in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters have deserved greater attention and they are far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film of Affleck lack a bit of tension, he allows himself to do with moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a story yet somehow incomplete to date, and as illustration of the character exaggeration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotents and omniscient, he made the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into banking fees the most absurd, decided now to launch the competition of the settlement and ideas from &quot;the workshop EU&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU plan, recently, adopt a quota of 40 percent of women on the boards of large European companies was at the root of our decision&quot;, said to the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> So far however, women were favoured in terms of insurance rates on life because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report until the end of the year any idea unbelievable &quot;the workshop of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of February 2013&quot;, informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, which has adverse implications for the environment, or the ban on using the reliable to mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics have also been issued in the past against a ban on use of the phrase &quot;butter spreads&quot; or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas of quality must have a size 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic now dominates the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of lobbyists are also, for example, responsible for the fact that in the EU, bananas should not be of a size smaller than 14 cm or submit an &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has defended by arguing that she did that harmonize national standards not homogeneous who made the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that the existing guidelines waste food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the resolution of the EU last year that should be on the inflatable balloons a warning stating that children under 8 years should not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has referred to a US inquiry that balls are among the toys, the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 years for what is blowing in trumpets. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> At home, too bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot;, and must instead refer to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot;Let&apos;s Roll&quot; liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in the investigation, in addition to certain absurdity mentioned above, the resolution of the Union on the volume of reserves of food on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set higher volumes for the reserves of food products that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, the volume set for risqua canned mushrooms and a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey found merit in the idea of pay sums of money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of a grant to apply for the subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact that you have no sea handicaps. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will ask the European Union a refund &quot;. so said, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued that because of our wheat production, and following the so-called &quot;interventionist&quot; purchases, the state got full stocks he had then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic was far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic, and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access by sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for obtaining grants have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should actually be used to write applications for grants awarded by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU says: &quot;the bizarre regulations are rare&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations are often criticised by the member states, according to many experts, efforts by the EU in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the member states during the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other EU countries, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it cannot fight not always winner) raises profound emotions for the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot;, to which the name &quot;Tuzemský rum&quot; dating back home in the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name &quot;Tuzemák&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the alcohol products of cane sugar, not sugar beet, can carry the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of products made in the EU are today with internationally renowned as the mostly cheese or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or of Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarské suchary&quot;), carps of Pohořelice and in Třeboň (&quot;Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr&quot;) and hops of Žatec (&quot;Žatecký Chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Bread of spice of Pardubice (&quot;Pardubický perník&quot;) and cakes called &quot;Cornets of Hořice&quot; (&quot;hořické trubičky&quot;) can also be proud of their community brand. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want I saved the Republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur, expresses senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how was it the idea to stand in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president who account for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn candidate nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I cannot cope with how the country is looted since the last 20 years that thieves are not behind bars and taxes and the retirement age rise. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something I&apos;m not, so I try to find a solution for change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You took in the Senate but you quickly en route to the Chateau (We: chair). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do you don&apos;t turn your back on who you have elected? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I am in the battle for the Chateau depending on the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Afterwards, I said that if I was elected senator, I would in presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, it is merely a tool allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need the influence the largest and broadest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television, but it is also that we piétinons cough those trying to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the press who breaks the reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It was, for example, I said to my misreporting journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Moving to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You started the fight for the castle with as hobbyhorse themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond 20 million CZK [of]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To that end, you have to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you don&apos;t have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I pressed for the activities of tourist guide is a profession liberal, successfully. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the politicking: when someone comes from the left or right with a good draft, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As independent, a member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, take each party that is best for our country and its implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You see, rather like a man left or right? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A Czech point of view, I feel that people put me rather left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that this is a little to the left or right, it is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> For me, it is not that people are left or right but to bring people together &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I am always any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you enragez when someone calls you a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you said do not prouve-t-il? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When choosing a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to bring you. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all proposals that I talk were implemented by the world and leading experts have talked about it. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of parliament, you can still slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You don&apos;t survivrez long in politics with it. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you&apos;re going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my camp to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I am elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Then they should possibly explain why they do not want to. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality who can identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been achieved through the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, unequivocally, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I&apos;m trying to find allies for my views and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I launch into politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try, alone, to make things, and if it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;ll quit in six years and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I&apos;m not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person can&apos;t tell the difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run in the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud to fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, there are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite everything, I lutterai for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to start your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I do not have the time to check if the past of each potential member is without blemish and then I don&apos;t have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about tax returns, what&apos;s yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think about 60 million worth of my personal property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I in Prague a ground worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always loved James Bond, travelling by car, and you&apos;ve got to dress up with women and fought against evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive your Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a $60 million and you don&apos;t have money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested $2 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I don&apos;t have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I couldn&apos;t live on, for instance, pay the English school my son costing 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my sole objective was to make money, I will submit to any election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So you will continue your business to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Don&apos;t you said you mettriez your activities muted? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not linked to the amount of the compensation. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy will take in the spring of the leadership of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> However, it should be while I deep something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would end my commercial activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in Saturday&apos;s edition of the journal Práva. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only imagination. we need only watch Spijkenisse mountain of books and the newly built - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think this building is funny, it&apos;s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see&quot;, said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer in a large company neighbour, we said: &quot;Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today to a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has Internet, an iPad and Oklahoma. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of those libraries ringardes, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a ville-dortoir which has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80,000 souls has the lowest level of education of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and replicate the seven fictional bridges on tickets euros in the form of cute little miniatures of reinforced concrete painted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics: the construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the Rotterdam architectural firm, MVRDV, master of diagrams sticks bold and creator of buildings witty and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and won the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the board members were still, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and ended his speech buttressed arguments by activists: &quot;expensive town!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up from land. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 houses. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Moreover, the project has been shortlisted for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> The small town dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian zone and a mayor of a postmodern ugliness bewildering, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy plant, has been fueled by a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural edifice in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell to cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Admittedly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you foulez the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The Interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in the Netherlands and the elegant brick lamp-posts unequivocally speak the language of municipal public places. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> There is already the gaze of public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and even books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a room large and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal&quot;, says Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely changed the classic Space configuration and open spaces in reading from the inside looking out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Inside the mountain of books has been skillfully fashioned: amid the offices, the library Internet, the chess club, the Centre for Environment and the technique of building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes ramps of stairs. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for the sight, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers of hardened building materials are not unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials&quot;, said Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> One day we found in a farm frisonne an ad hoc waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and we win over time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressée, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis four inches thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the effect of the heat and pressure, the &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) change colour and transforms into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose smell evokes both a new car and shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> On top of the 105 stairs is the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> After nearly 500 metres, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, but also Dutch nuggets and potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They create an atmosphere, but mostly they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity in the air of the mountain literary. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the soul new </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is unbelievable, but despite all surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in terms of ecology&quot;, says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is resolved by geothermal. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is below a bell glass, the sun lights that little time inside, even the days of good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick timber beams mounted wrong compared to the facade of glass used pare-soleil, intercepting a large part of the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The prevailing atmosphere is very nice. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The blinds completely automated can do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the septic computer programmer, has already risky to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even the Boekenberg describes as the &quot;soul&quot; of Spijkenisse finally found. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago indeed, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book based on his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This has led to fill the voids of the library, which was not yet fully loaded (today it has 70,000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are overflowing from all sides. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a half-empty library&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV reached discipline mistress that is referred to in the professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Although it may seem young and poorly educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, a new starting point for the birth of a new identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;Germans should play a bigger role&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: earlier this week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then she chose abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany did not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin should exercise caution, because it has a special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support either the US position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO attacked this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany éprouve-t-elle difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are therefore on several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they still are experimenting to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy &quot;more normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That means so concretely the term of foreign policy &quot;normal&quot; for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to adopt positions beyond those of the United States and European partners, including the national issues. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relationship with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced Germany&apos;s stance on the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention at the United Nations vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why Berlin should take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is undoubtedly a key element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I do not accorderais too much importance, because it is not exclusively relationship unilateral. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is certainly an important element in the German strategic thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany nuit-elle to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think the gap is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps that Germany will be respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States announced its veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> The opinions diffèrent-elles between the United States and most European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly a great understanding toward the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course not defend his position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you&apos;ll notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm about the policies of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany éprouve-t-elle struggling to reconcile its close relationship with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it is not helpful for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They may not register within a broader political line and must assert their unique position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is what they are currently in the issue of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will continue to play a leading role and will push Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But to me, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany into play a role of weight on the international stage, Germany, want only assume a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or she always struggle to assume leading roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still unaccustomed, it was always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties to play a bigger role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not help matters for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: we don&apos;t want to be surrounded hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must deal with neighbours and opinions varied, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only diminished, but at the moment, the EU is not filling the vacuum, then who is left? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if you don&apos;t like them, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts in Europe and North America to analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, in US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of brands&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are trademarks known around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is this really about? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind the name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand has a certain protection as the company bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, there is no assurance that it would succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China&quot;, says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new file arrived on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators did need some additional letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So, instead of Gucci, recorded Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, recorded Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the maker of sporting goods. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a file cabinet in the recordings with the trademark office of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in siphoning off part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In major cities, the malls on several floors that virtually that sell counterfeit goods. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituencies the responsibility to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak of &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, is relative. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from &quot;Bang dakuan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are designated women who marry rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say he had nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, we must fight against this trend&quot;, requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is paltry, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs are estimated to be in the millions for sectors, especially regarding key products expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third global market for luxury goods and fastest growing faster. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to write off the dubious recordings of the register trademarks and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reported cases in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a &quot;reality of the marketplace&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch explained to us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money in plagiaire, because it would have interfered with its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also concern graphics. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the maker of construction machinery Sany, the same company that had bought the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the acquisiteur Volvo, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. the conflict was settled and Geely had to amend it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademark office ctmo in Beijing admitted, however, have faced some challenges in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the IPO would be spent last year of an &quot;emergency situation in the conduct of the work to a newfound normality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> The number of procedures untreated opposition has dropped 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending in the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Expensive act </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for filing marks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the 10th consecutive time at the top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It would also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, every recording reported on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle is costing far more, as illustrated by the case of the German family-owned Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of components of vehicles will be suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitateur was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault because names cannot be protected in Germany&quot;, said Hanno Wentzler, president of the leadership of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The trademark office had rejected the objection of Feld-herrnhalle. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has certainly been successful with the following two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Vigilance is </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending at the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and extols the professionalism of judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, he added: &quot;the procedure is long, hard and cost us a lot of time and money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. the service archives has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a &quot;large sum in euros to six figures&quot; to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This is what you see what this means for us&quot;, says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if the imitators of this region assured the exploitation of unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company in footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;vigilance is required&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international law, foreigners should instead &quot;record in China everything which is likely to be protected&quot;, said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the recording. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay a license fee to the other side for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will lose our place on the segment of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeats Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans of Swaziland welcome their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> This is the story of a link that is much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, you pat the foot: the cowboy boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and moccasins for men seek the pace by hitting the ground underfoot. very quickly, they are. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, the voices of the singers are growing slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they go overboard, mesmerised and unfold. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years, lost almost his canvas shoes when he conducted the orchestra with its actions of a wild flexibility. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the music room of the 12 hours of labor Médicale Institute in Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years came, the généticienne in human medicine to the man at home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;OM&apos; Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each choir member has different words, all in a language very exotic: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help themselves </seg>
<seg id="1713"> UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide have the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland has 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attending secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become godfather. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the centre gogo. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi Zulu means &quot;raconteur&quot; or even &quot;singer of praise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak fluent in the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly 10 years, the choir repeat songs in the foreign language that she has brought in Germany to now make it to his native region: southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because at 8,733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland is eSitjeni the village, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of sufferers </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 residents, some of whom live in modest straw huts or land and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them are orphaned, because HIV took their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> To eSitjeni, one can see smaller scale the ills plaguing Swaziland: HIV infection rates, the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population accepts almost never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction proved the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the HIV virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the middle 30s. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a group trip in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had discovered the village. the imbongis have seen many children in the street it not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country without school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the beginning, it was just some people who pledged personally to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely a year later, the choir based &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, an association that has since then almost professional of AIDS orphans in eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial STI, syphilis, and gonorrhea patients chlamydiées (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The STIs common are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The pubis lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STD. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the groups mainly concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea patients often appear among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are at the root of at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Among adults straight, infections linked to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidose fungal (), the gonorrhoea and human papillomavirus are sexually transmitted diseases common. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. however, some 20 percent of new HIV infections are occurring within the group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, there is a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the trend in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not required to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in the past 10 years: the figure rose to 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there have been about massive case. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a disease sexual? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urinary tract pain, white losses, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the emergence of buttons and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do not have regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubrifiante or close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts recommend to anyone frequent changes of sexual partners to conduct regular reviews. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of STIs diagnosed quickly can be cured of late and the consequences can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially to funds that are reaping the repertoire with their votes through Germany as a whole, the means accumulates. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent nearly 200,000 euros to eSitjeni&quot;, says Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that orphans are well housed, with one of their grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The gogos, thus so-called old women in Zulu are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that they get up every day on time at school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has no person is hosted in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has established a school of fashion and allowed the construction of two barns. with the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association has organized an HIV test for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a matter of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;The AIDS is a real taboo&quot;, says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is an issue which affects sexuality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 wives official. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These social mores sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also planted the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> There is however condoms on every street corner, says Annette Lennartz, &quot;but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Culture is different, flesh on flesh &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> Somewhat to promote cultural exchange, the repertoire of Imbongi go together in trip every two or three years in southern Africa and entonnent songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the edge of the black continent still know the time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full of white people who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only a good mood and joy, but sometimes also rips a tear to some formidable border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes them always to eSitjeni where the repertoire visit their filleuls. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, eSitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to eSitjeni, you&apos;ll find the light&quot;, say the people there. </seg>

<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains water ice, one three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the world permanently mired in the shade. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Water probably comes from comets or asteroids, which may have hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, there is no link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, says the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help understand how water and other essentials to life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Notice of the world&apos;s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, they send images to land, such small interstices through which there is forever. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by scientists in Germany of the Max-Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> As Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet&quot;, according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of a photograph taken by the Spitzer infrared telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;babies&quot; in the delivery room of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, called &quot;W5&quot;, a name few romantic, in the constellation Cassiopeia, to 6,500 light-years away. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a star dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The circle in the form of a grand is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the vast nebula Trifide, 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope has photographed the delivery room Plane. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades, star cluster also called the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, can be seen with the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope is more colors in value. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> In this photo scrapbook, the nebula Hélice, as a red eye, looking directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a continent on earth earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo reveals a dramatic hue. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its glory. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the biggest riddles of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the photographs the larger and sharper that has taken the Hubble Space Telescope is the galaxy of Tourbillon. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the tint, photographs of galaxies can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light-years away. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, split into three), because three dragged dust divide the gleaming heart the birthplace of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pileup in the constellation of Serpentaire: to 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two galaxies in merger rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble Space Telescope has seen the birth of these stars in the galaxy spiral M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you don&apos;t like the abbreviations techniques, you can use his nickname &quot;wheel of Southern fire&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula Iris, in the constellation King Cepheus &quot;daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is at 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was developed from photos taken by various optical and X-ray telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle of black holes which lies 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the greatest &quot;GC 1810 spiral galaxy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula is the group of young brightest stars of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The cradle heavenly still gives birth to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by the the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5000 light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is that gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our view of the universe: the main telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galilee utilisât a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, mirrors optical telescopes have not stopped growing thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world&apos;s largest telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa was Action segmented to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reached just about 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set in the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> The peculiarity to his great ability to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes to mirror of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists listen to the universe in search of space aliens signals using the Arecibo radio telescope of (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or&quot; search for alien intelligence &quot;) involving the computing power of his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope (&quot;very large telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum means. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a huge telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror should reach impressive size 42 meters. it will consist of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope can take photos before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirror with a diameter of 10 metres each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Keck telescopes are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration can admire it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of space the most important we come from the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since the April 24, 1990, we book images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The Hubble Space James-Webb (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be tasked to find the light from the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists think the South Pole Mercury is also home to the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data exists on this theory, because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole to Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar data indicated for decades ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> With the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to circling around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In southern Azerbaijan, many people are ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In southern Azerbaijan, many people are ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip in the mountains Talysh is a romantic échevelé. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The sort of many turning points of the road, the small bus cahote along forested hills, torrential rivers and farms modest. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the remote south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which little is known, if only they are fluent in Persian and the Azeri and they have a very great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town plastronne too aggressive with its architecture of the Soviet era that is not at all with the picturesque mountain scenery. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road has only one way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist site. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest in the world&quot;, says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> You can discover the lives of approximately eight tens of Talysh region with more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows a black and white image. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here are my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Still have a child to 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the star of the controversial museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is however no birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when you think the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems an unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973&quot;, says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and he would have been 23 children. at the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Şirali Müslümov would have misled few decades in calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;People older surprisingly also live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan&quot;, says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia, too, there are men who are incredibly old&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> However, it is in fact that people in the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, about 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So what is the reason for longevity in the southern part of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, think it is a question of diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that meals rich in calories of Talysh, who like meat, bread and mainly dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the young people? to Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the floor beside a baratte, it beats the content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children gambadent also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, we prepare tea to guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of stomach. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide long braids of a dark blonde reveals that his son with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always washed my hair with milk, and this is how I have not lost and they have kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I&apos;ve never used shampoo&quot;, adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always ate what comes from his own firm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells us of her husband, who was in the military. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the &quot;beloved&quot; father Heydar Aliyev took the lead. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, grows almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded to him afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And maybe the son of long grisonnant Mirzayeva is right: &quot;seniors enjoy great respect in our culture&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the center of the great family, they are loved, treated and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;Human rights&quot; failed in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution was reborn in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not a man of few words so full of emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must succeed the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God&quot;, he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was aimed at the entire people, and especially the Christian Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition fear desperately confused and divided. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its responsibilities &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world didn&apos;t really know what to save this engineer 61 years, received a doctorate degree from the American University of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary be overthrown? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the constituent assembly muslim 100 people during a nighttime tour de force of 15 hours are indeed worrisome to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the bill proposes that the case law is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that really means the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and still is always a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the room for manoeuvre resulting legal to implement a stricter interpretation of sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case is that suggests an article stipulating that newly introduced, regarding all issues relating to the Sharia, the university Al-Azhar ulema must be consulted. the facility is the Islamic institution, the country&apos;s largest and its lustre radiates throughout the Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislature, which would lead to the de facto guardianship of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another issue is the maintenance of the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts if employèrent suppress opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state must also, reads the project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote morality and values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of filmmaking art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, it is simply censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantees equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another article prohibits to offend or to defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> By contrast, the article does not define what is offensive or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are open to interpretation in the project that Morsi will submit to the vote and who, in his own words, will &quot;very soon&quot; the subject of a referendum among Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The renait revolution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition mobilizes for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to unseat sharia law before it takes effect. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is resurgent, and we&apos;re going to win&quot;, Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is &quot;to throw in the dustbin of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to stage a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If it affirms the referendum, we will go to his palace and the renversera&quot;, exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié&quot;, said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced not wanting to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well-organized, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer service was held at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Veiled women and supporters of Salafist who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;the people are asking for the implementation of the law of God&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Nettoie our country!&quot; demandaient-ils to Morsi, saying that &quot;the Koran [their] Constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where it all began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Clearly, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of Islamists win certainly the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned once&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process which should have imposed until February and include all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The lawyer of human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> That is why he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the end is not even mentioned once in the new constitution&quot;, he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag &quot;newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of the three branches Morsi has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will spark a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president denied all its powers&quot;, says Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could afford. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protester in the square Tharir warns: &quot;You accouchez a monster that you will no longer be possible to control&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk Norway: is this the most fragrant fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway enjoy some of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite for a fish extremely fragrant? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take cheese developed. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Taking in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It&apos;s snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and that smell, pervasive, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout saupoudrée salt and what in the water for a period - according to the smell that you want it collections Friend - which can be up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness settled and it&apos;s cold, the Norwegians gathered en masse to attend a festival held here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat raw, then you avalez a glass of aquavit&quot;, says Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full-time also called &quot;rakfisk General&quot;, responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and slip a large quantity of beverage. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk&quot;, says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The beverage kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid the move under your nose, it&apos;s not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi who reportedly spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in this water resistant to the air, then salty in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once well fermented, fish is out and - no doubt with the direction undermined by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now, the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the top earners and a comprehensive health system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, although fragrant, the past Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This dish is more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not for her debuts. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist, racist who shot 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they evoke this killing, they talk about &quot;the incident on 22 July&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians are unwilling to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their number had been able to commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the single reason for our success&quot;, says Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk by hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how do you say - people prudent. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are quiet, we don&apos;t like to shine. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with caution - all, except for a small percentage of the proceeds of this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries were throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept the purse strings tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as you can ski in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy&quot;, says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk&quot;, she adds with a laugh happy-go-lucky. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my share of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stayed is one of many places using the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV where the presenter wearing his trademark bowties, surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> You would think the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What did you score the best fish in the mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;This is our points, Havard&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> You hear laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls to his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC looks at the challenges ahead and expectations of the people, of which there are many. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from reaching their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, the results for the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence&quot;, said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A populous state and sprawling on the capital. on his land of choice, the new leader&apos;s views on this are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A man direct </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The local attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was given to these roads, formerly bosselées and full of crevasses. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Displaying his name plates hang outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to establish lasting change&quot;, said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change that our country desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejected criticism from opponents who blame the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Indeed, it is very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It&apos;s a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden beneath the autoponts highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also practical and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone, we found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the killings perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this neighborhood dilapidated Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back the tears when she shows me pictures of his daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version reported a suicide by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believe she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed&quot;, says the Buendia disembarked. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigidity cadaverous was already underway. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dressing the wall beside a cross which contains the word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family was denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a fautrice disquiet, a pleurnicheuse. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and to cease. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be as good as president when he was governor&quot;, said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, say prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of mistreatment of Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial covers the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia, USA. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning is in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to show Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the Manning case be dropped on the grounds that the kidnapping was done in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that officers had fulfilled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison at Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers have raised questions on Manning and entered his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that gave him his guards had &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had been within the prison was generally &quot;very professional&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do no complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison, said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded the issues raised. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote&quot; no problem &quot; (after addressing the concerns), however, this does not mean that I had not raised problems&quot;, said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special committee which had gathered to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months ago. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said his intention during the meeting was to alter his status restrictive indicating a &quot;risk of injury&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they had assigned the restrictive status -- a level below the surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the staff know that I was going well, and I wanted that I withdraw this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view&quot;, said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, USA, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and be gone once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact that we have not been kept abreast of what was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage&quot;, said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also added that the only things he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He tried to keep moving, because sleep or lie down during the day was against the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he would come back at night, they so as to be able to see her face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer has filed a formal complaint to the treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also on Friday, the judge asked questions Manning on an allegation reported in her testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked a whole night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, he was only allowed to cover themselves with a blanket during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said he knew from his custody order that he should drop its coverage that could not hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered him to unleash it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning reportedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or with his flip-flops to harm themselves, but that it did not. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that her underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account of his experiences during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence should he be found guilty at a court martial trial that should be held early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty to the offences and fight for abandoning other charges deemed too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who will argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was jailed under the rules governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all charges are being held, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans difficult times, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette said that the Mexico-américains are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two tracks: one for the &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for the &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Étrangers&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed motionless for several seconds, leading to what I would do. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I was called the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is an ethnic epithet, as my friends from Boston use when they say, &quot;Irish&quot;, or my friends in New York when they say &quot;Italian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then I became &quot;mexico-américain&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land that has seen my grandfather, no need for special word or link. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can&apos;t lose my accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my U.S. passport and I headed towards the queue &quot;Étrangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visit President Obama at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when leaders of the two countries meet, their themes include immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also wanted to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the US invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give written half their territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism against Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints about how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And children Montezuma seek the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship the more difficult is that the country&apos;s relationship with the more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want broaching the subject of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a certain point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most often, this person matched a profile type -- a dark-skinned, uneducated man from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not that of Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We attach to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn&apos;t like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were individuals and not enough ethnic below Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would be not stuck on the wrong side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who immigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between the Mexicans and the Mexico-Américains because Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Américains are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although American citizen, she has a sense of belonging to two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Moreover, many Mexico-Américains I know don&apos;t have the sense of being part of a country or the other. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the Mexican group, Los del Norte Tigers, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And the United States, we are seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There are too many bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if one considers the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half, they must accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members were treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can only ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed seems to indicate that this was a vain hope. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While the same arguments persist futile to know which began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by the regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Maybe their fight will continue to rise a little more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help break the impasse fatal. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser or winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire granted on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to give up even if Gaza had been crushed. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power booming, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Hamas members jubilent and say that the Islamist is growing curve around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has ruled, through Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Al-Assad and to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player who will not be excluded even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, hardliners of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been called into box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has prospered, including under Binyamin Netanyahu, the premier-ministre, which has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that cuts into the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and to protect Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegality in terms of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with a party even more combative, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, has the most beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why dorloter these fichus giving them a Palestinian state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they run the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe hardliners prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere enjoy little Israel, their first priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israelis should also look to the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world who becomes more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression weakens already democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates the problem as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need to be driven by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give an opportunity to people outside of this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with exchange of ground and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs abroad should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the establishment of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a pseudo state at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not submitted its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a vision very narrow. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Middle East stability is vital for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws of cigarette packs neutral came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and pictures of diseased organs incorporated the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and images of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Outside of the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the strict regime in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government has said that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they never starting. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their image&quot;, said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children pooled the crown of a logo with a princess &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would boost the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The consequences of this legislation&quot;, said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters China and Indonesia will sell well over counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have said the law had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for holsters to cigarettes, including silicone to conceal the horrific packaging, rose sharply two months since British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the proportion of the population being targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, the sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it can prevent foreign sites to do. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the marketing of tobacco and you more than a small display to promote your products, the Internet is the place unavoidable par excellence&quot;, said after Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask if it is a simple citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and that has bothered to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses on the new regulations into effect rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have reported to the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has been significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to interlocks photos of warning on the packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tighter laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to those photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos don&apos;t bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you put the package&quot;, said Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package that included a photo of cancer of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be honest, the only reason that will make me stop, this is my daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult storage packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I needed one hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours&quot;, said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to ban them once and for all, and we said OK, it&apos;s good, and you put the key in the door&quot;, he added, in their arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it can be good to get bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I had plenty of time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I&apos;m not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract yourself (not to mention the duty free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development spoke highly of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal to us - and our children - bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to borrow roads interesting, even feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we know more about the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So should we host boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But that is not the case &quot;, says Peter Justice Toohey (Australia), Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of&quot; Boredom: a Lively History &quot; (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The problem goes back a long way&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then there&apos;s the definition that we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After numerous publications and presented the idea in a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but had failed to engage in an activity satisfactory&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, there is not the desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, combined with a grumpy and feel that time passes slowly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can greatly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be related, people who are bored tend to think the problem is the environment or the world, while people who are depressed believe that the problem comes from them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we often think that we&apos;re bored when in fact it is a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> As part of their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Caution&quot;, which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience oldest in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV who had no report, others have just heard the TV, and the third group has not all heard the pc. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard the TV to a low noise level said they had more annoyed that the other two groups - they have struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you&apos;re trying to concentrate on a difficult task or stakeholder, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> In contrast, when you perform a task boring, &quot;like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bother you&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, now we know that when we are tortille or scrawls, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and get more information than those who are forced to stay without moving&quot;, said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We&apos;re bored one day or another - the delay of my plane ride, a listener with a voice lifeless, a film particularly annoying. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;Nuclear Event Scale of predisposition to boredom&quot; in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes statements such as, &quot;Among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous&quot;, and &quot;I have so much interest that I do not have time to do everything&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, including need stimulation many and varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are quickly blase. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32 percent of teens reported bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent said they get bored when they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of parents said bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew &quot;adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level&quot;, partly because children and adolescents don&apos;t have much control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I based my question: boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take risks physical absurd, make bets or abusing certain substances to pass the time, as studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity &quot;, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The problem is the way that the brain has found to inform you that you should do something else&quot;, said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cooking, that make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it gets lonely, but it will not have learned to handle alone or autorégler, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this autorèglement passes from one situation to another&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think we should glorify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think we should criticize him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable outside the constant upheavals that generate the activities and technology is the goal for which we should strive for. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to be bored more often, but boredom an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are looking for is a way to get away and enjoy downtime. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés&quot;, he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no guidelines for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and footballer in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon be legal in his state: the meatballs possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were driving a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a subpoena for drug possession and material consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a scheduled court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals&quot;, said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving a low use of drugs is more dependent on the place of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were closed. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have ceased to indict adults 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts of Colorado called for accelerating the affairs of existing marijuana and continue to charge people who possess them. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the Denver suburbs to the mountains of West currently vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the state in their neighbourhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what the future holds for us&quot;, said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in Washington state are also a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing him to produce, produce, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulations on marijuana, firstly concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator&quot;, said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could base, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a void for a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the rule which guarantees adequate access to marijuana accredited and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to install an Agreed trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle&quot;, said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis Centre, a research group recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that &quot;City attorney&quot; (public prosecutor) would only pursue more people 21 years and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police must cease to charge people for this type of offence &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> To Weld County in northern Colorado, the &quot;district attorney&quot; (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users that they will be fully detox. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At present, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has an obligation to pursue legal action against those who have committed a crime which, at the time, was an offence recognized&quot;, said Mr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions have been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but has also decided not to drop a case all cases of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offer a proper governmental and legal framework for the personal use of marijuana is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier&quot; with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws &quot; (National Organization for the reform of laws on marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who consumed marijuana, also, they find it hard to accept that this is legal&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to treat the limited use of marijuana at the same level of alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials predict a new frontier of legalised sales, they expect with concern the federal government guidelines, which designs always sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will yield. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the commercial sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police aren&apos;t likely kicking down doors to seize small packets of drugs, it is likely that she opposes accredited businesses for sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities of Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is only a year&apos;s delay. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a moratorium of six months, and is expected to impose the ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem&quot;, said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We&apos;re interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and ruled out of Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not just today&apos;s students who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother have studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university because I had objected to the fact that of undergraduates had sex in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in cups ébréchées. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and been the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why am I talking about it today, I agree. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Rising hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the room students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were &quot;often isolated, attacked personally and feel undesirable&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want there to be a representative on the committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;The Wonderland: young, Intelligents and Right&quot;), devoted to the policy among students, and the Tories &quot;&quot; being portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It discovered including the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) &quot;, which uses a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver and moves with a cane to head chromée. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the &quot;Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that&quot; there is a growing left-wing bias in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of members of the JCR to the people who are center-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;It was an impediment to freedom of intellectual debate and the well-being of members&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came in September 1986, I was 18 and a crippling shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a title, because of reduced funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week, when new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that teachers not only attended the sarcasm to students Tory but they were having fun. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm that I have been the victim was a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I wasn&apos;t prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt&quot;, said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please bring the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost my footing. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man in the face pustuleux, easily prevailed. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Tears burnt the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you take French during your free time - finally, if you&apos;re not too busy to make friends&quot;, he launched a 127 tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room, weeping inconsolably. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner that evening, I sat only then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in second grade in English, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are&quot;, he said, gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I fear it. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I did not agree with everything that had said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This ploy failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first year student of philosophy, political science and economic, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was distorted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do the Tories love?&quot; asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, isn&apos;t it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Labour and disown my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Tory was openly professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher&apos;s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view of marxiste-déterministe history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here&quot;, he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started commuting between Oxford and home to my parents in London, finding refuge with family and friends urban more open-minded. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was in disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But this is the best place in the world&quot;, he told me pathétiquement. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They wouldn&apos;t do that, not in the city to dreamers church steeples. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends Communists had ways blameless. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He was in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Laisse-leur a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure this is to tease. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I break the heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has steadily deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a meeting of work directed the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously in the world, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Rougissant internally of shame, I recognised to be a victim of brainwashing of my parents and the traitai &quot;old&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> Nestling I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I have never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me to wimp pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no one under 18 should not be a victim of such a bullying at school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The tragedy is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a solid reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefer elegance to notoriety&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: master of Couture&quot;, opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other celebrity clients of the Italian designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer acknowledged at the opening of &quot;Valentino: master of Couture&quot;, a retrospective prestigious which brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this&quot;, he said with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;signore&quot; Garavani, who but that could not be written without his famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino exposes memorabilia as trophies of his upward mobility: the designer of the small town of Voghera, in northern Italy, the toast of the international jet set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong with love royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least they don&apos;t break their cigarette butts on your splendid carpet as do some pop stars&quot;, says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, we all lived both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a host spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We adorions all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad&quot;, says the ex-wife of &quot;&quot; Heini Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred to elegance to notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, did not forget the charisma of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decor, the food, the music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, each guest was important and appreciated&quot;, recalls the &quot;top model&quot;, who began working with him during the week of the doubt anxious in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;He never will it be fashion, because his creations are works of art&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of noble lineage </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of love obsessions but shared. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He likes the people well behaved and with the biggest titles and they love it too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must be marching on the podium to admire a &quot;public&quot; dream of bringing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among the public of models include names like Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Abascal Naty and designer in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of her clients say that the first clothes Valentino are like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I still remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat &quot;Gillette&quot; and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a gift that he had done to me&quot;, said Naty Abascal, a muses of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer to all the other for her femininity, his great love of women, and because it sublime our beauty&quot;, adds the ex-duchesse of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colors he uses, they are bright and shed light on the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Princess and Patricia della Giovampaola modeuse d&apos;Arenberg can not forget the first time she has been a model Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red evening dress with a skirt to flying a bustier draped and a Sandwich Islands to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true&quot;, said the widow of Rodrigue d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless&quot;, says Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess d&apos;Arenberg retains the designer&apos;s evening dresses with &quot;great care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, she is also all the memories she vehicle&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The final major exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage to Paul Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the designer calls its seamstresses) to achieve this dress in ivory silk with coloured beads, 12 kinds of different laces and a train of four and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of couture of the late 20th century, &quot;the return of client high society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> For years by the nerd &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani has so many honours as any husband of her clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;His sophistication, his calm, he looks perfect cared for and I have always been evident&quot;, d&apos;Arenberg acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him, it was a month at a gala dinner at the Musée d&apos;Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;He was spotless, the years have no effect on him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If this is a princess who says... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen human mules </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilos of sulphur stone pathways across the top. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom work is hell and others who work literally hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living in bringing the sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having reaped large rocks of sulfur, weighing a total of nearly 70 pounds, he moved in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders trails across the top. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters, but the porters exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a pace of turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened in a French tourist who suffered a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur excerpt. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once on top, it their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and wearing painfully heavy baskets, walked the three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, you might say, its employees, to whom she pays 662 rupees (Indonesian 5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> She then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry because it is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whitewash the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we carry about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip&quot;, explains Anto, usually three trips a day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> All it took 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it may be a misery for such a superhuman effort is triple what he would win in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.20 euros) a day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) &quot;, said the porter who once worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also no doubt that the sulfur: &quot;I married a girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I reduced to Java to that she should convert to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing constantly, and his eyes are angered by the toxic gas. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At age 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and door special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing constantly, and his eyes are angered by the toxic gas emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work even two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French&quot; promet-t-il English in a more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this young friendly and intelligent could be guidebook, server or a receptionist at a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a hovel of substandard wood with other carriers, rises every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because of sulphur does not out at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow becomes shines in the middle of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the dark, Anto goes down into the crater in illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porters load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters who are self-employed and are paid to the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Moreover, they do not affect either a under 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees ($1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is done for the animals, not humans&quot;, protests Madrusin, a portly 42-year-old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that he will not stop working &quot;as long as it can&quot;, because he needs money to raise her three sons, aged between 10 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I won&apos;t retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur damaged throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turned and trap the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so tough that no one complains to suffer serious diseases... plus of course their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in his knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> In balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, age 53, can only charge 50 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, his companions and extracting him 15 tons of sulfur in volcano that three trucks carry the Tamansari warehouse, 18 miles away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I won&apos;t retire, I will die here because the volcano is my life&quot;, says Unainik opening of the mouth, revealing several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as porter of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time is running out, but poverty persist from generation to generation, one of the hardest jobs in the world: what are the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore research babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans cast the responsibility of this lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore should develop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfilling our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that those words come from an advertisement for the mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a rap group which uses local references like &quot;Come put an open secret in the drawer&quot; to mock the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem of funny way through this publicity. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to &quot;fulfill their national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the birth rate, and we felt it was an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things as launch pheromone fragrances or hold speed-dating evenings. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative but they don&apos;t necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We are therefore said the following: what could be more creative in solving this problem than to do a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The Singapore government does not take this lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers is providing up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high-tech cité-état Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time he has been above 2, considered the renewal rate was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says that it is the &quot;best education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the formation of a family&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and to delay marriage and the births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increase immigration to curb the population has created a resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites that shares a barely disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese who are accused of shooting down wages and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year has experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it started to get the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot;, which can be built in specific areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale enjoyed great success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities were concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers who want to build large family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the property company EL Developers, says his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sell much faster than the housing greatest. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more quickly than those of larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more profitable for cash. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards give instructions clearer to developers, who was previously a spanner in the works if they wanted to offer too small in a housing project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a cité-État. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations could be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, chatting with Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would seem that they are not having much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that&apos;s why people give to later&quot;, says a young framework. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my money and my time&quot;, said another young 20s. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of homeownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies are Singaporeans themselves have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private is private offline online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or &quot;the area of privacy that we can protect any intrusion&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> That est-ce-qui is in the private domain for those under 16? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Understand the dangers it is exposed to broadcast on the Internet of events that he does not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they associate the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level and &quot;the password and username&quot; when they have applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I&apos;m not my personal secrets in a post&quot;, says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are very secrets secret, my mother can know them but not everyone&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB I&apos;ll post images nice or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discusses with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I don&apos;t share any of my pictures or someone who would be a fool&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy recognized that it was wrong to publish lewd photos of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 on FB friends as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His mother is a part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write of interesting ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they say, I simply post&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;The social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or friends, rapid way&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He says he would never accept the demand for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> He wouldn&apos;t trust someone who would recommend a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits he does not know 20 of those on its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, nobody gave him advances or asked for her address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they gave me pressure or required, I simply supprimerais of my account&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today under the name of cyber-stalking are not foreign to the boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The near one of my friends was deputy on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He spent only in private profile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> We then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account of safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I&apos;d do if I was angry or upset. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know that this is the cyberstalking&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos says, professor of English and dismissed in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Says reports that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book &quot;Natifs and digital immigrants&quot;, uses these words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, we are digital immigrants who must then teach them, while we ourselves are learning&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He added that the issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what is needed or not disclose, to publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences&quot;, she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality for children and adolescents is to use issues that are sobering. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Their to not do it serves no purpose&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, says lists examples: there are things that you don&apos;t would tell a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you like they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Did you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identifies pictures of holidays, demandes-tu other people permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone he need to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In each consisting of words, they will have a solid foundation for talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to share or publishing&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind the children not to talk to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of the Unasur ended without the Declaration of Lima is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended in Peru today without the Declaration of Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 proxies present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE has tried repeatedly to access the document signed during the sixth Oedipus Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency reported initially that he would be released after the close of the summit, then said that it would be published at a moment&apos;s notice on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists &quot;access to information about the summit has consistently been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the presidential meeting with the message, &quot;private session, audio restricted&quot; was broadcast in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among the journalists were those of the officers of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents here, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding information more important. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd summit of South American and Arab countries (takes) and, on this occasion, although this has been insisted by the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the takes, we can verify that the document was published in March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems safe for all journalists, but they have the most limited obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit has also signed a joint agreement with Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Court in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the lawsuit that Lima filed against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect the verdict and exécuterons who solve disputes that we wear today in this international court&quot;, said President Humala, beside his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law to the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals&quot;, added President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, beside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of two presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Stability Bogota by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua she considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> Host President Ollanta Humala has been asked to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The trustee has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would put in place of &quot;important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residency permits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He was informed that shares would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, equities for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess together and effective the risks of natural disasters &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triomphaliste but should help increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our people&quot;, concluded the President Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection spaces for South America, particularly in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic system&quot;, said the Peruvian president in a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he noted that five were Peru and were on the broad lines of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two targeted a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give any more details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations&quot;, which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly of maritime dispute through the ICJ judgment requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega&quot;, said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua who will ask to have a discussion with the country&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and environmentally friendly as possible&quot;, said President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the take-over of the new President, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers gather prior to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru is the President Pro Tempore of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;The South America must learn from Europe how to fit a citizenship&quot;, says Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal to which &quot;South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Cairns Group, that Europeans &quot;were killed during the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but that they were now almost a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We must reach the free movement of citizens and workers in any Latin American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to do a thing of the past&quot;, he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, the president of Ecuador has shown for the restoration of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the pact in San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who we rebattent ears will never compromise, conversely, we, the South American countries, have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States&quot;, he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he does not regret her decision, because he has himself betrayed its principles, but instead it met its &quot;profound democratic values and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that, at the time, &quot;there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Moreover, it criticized the Swedish justice who demanded that he had misrepresented on its territory to interrogation for an alleged sexual offence while &quot;own Swedish laws can do this by videoconference, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the physical and mental health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, the ambassador told me that he had had a small lung problem, but nothing serious&quot;, said the president of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked into a small space without being able to exercise in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of anyone&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a pass that would allow her to travel to Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and emphasized that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the constraints of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we don&apos;t use that word in this case, but there have been discussions permanent. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European institutions&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he believes that &quot;if Britain gave the safe-conduct tomorrow, it would end up&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as is quite suitable for its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa was able to reassert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that what he did was &quot;not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that are detrimental to freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians or malicious perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, he welcomed this is not that kind of journalists &quot;neither bankers nor the hegemonic countries and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador&quot;, and rather than put forward his re-election, &quot;he approfondirait the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, by arguing that the agency &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts&quot;, because in reality &quot;that destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> What is more, the president of Ecuador is &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this ruling is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a Latin American country and a Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We must solve them together to overtake them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he expressed confidence in the right resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said it is &quot;beneficial that Latin America seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so strong that it is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has assured me that if he lost the primary to February 2013, he withdrew from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be solved through the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement thought it was me who guarantees this possible victory but we must accept that responsibility&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last presidential term and I retirerai then politics. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will also. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It&apos;s my decision&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talk with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chavez&quot;, he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of state of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS-related deaths are now due to a belated detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the test result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky was dropped on the head&quot;, he says, referring to the time of the announcement, the physician had tried to make &quot;less painful&quot;, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man was hidden from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take care only of his illness and began to inquire about her and her effort was such that he just celebrate his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients unity of HIV to the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more scars. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye &quot;because he was speechless&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In the meantime, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their disease, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same&quot;, said the head of the unit&apos;s HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those subsisting on drugs: up to 30 years to a rate of CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those rising at a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a diagnosis HIV positive for 25 years, &quot;as long as he remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years&quot;, said the scientist asked. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To put this in context, you should know that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why is there still death? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think the problem is not with access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed medicine, the problem is that patients are able to stadiums very developed countries because they don&apos;t know they are infected, or they learn in the advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine in ten patients come when they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is deliver early diagnosis, and for that we have to offer screening tests, to all those who ask for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the State Council of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who was making his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already infected with AIDS and sarcoma&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are going to die and don&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I&apos;m going to die, it is better that I broke out three times a week&quot;, they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was good, I eat well, exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents knew only that he was suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, as anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but share responsibility, I pay attention to me and the other person&quot;, says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share its intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World Day against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They make the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, they should know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summed up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who have embraced the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the greatest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places dedicated to this, &quot;it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now we have packages of 100 is very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &apos;What are you going to do? &quot;asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers did not want to hear&quot;, says the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposes to reorient the inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold to retail outlets, but only found in distributors of public toilets and in places that are attending the young. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This is not to encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not their pay girls and the motel, as the governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;This is not how it works sexuality, it&apos;s best to provide condoms to people already sexually active&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is the fourth state in the country in terms of number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV-infected people. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are through sexual contact, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every case recorded four or five people who do not. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores debt restructuring of the group Vitro arrived via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. the scenario is causing a negative precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and having solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the starry banner, different approach to international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to seize the US Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register according to the bankruptcy law, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean to denounce the cooperation of international legal procedure in cases of insolvency of businesses with a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the law Model United Nations Uniformité Commercial International Law was set up for this purpose in taking the American Law Institute as a referee. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling establishes that without the vote intersociétés, recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy commercial debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Electoral Institute of des Faillites had guaranteed the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, what is certain is that, because there remained the votes of subsidiaries in all ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in U.S. courts, i.e. &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have acquired the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Given a reversal by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that dealt with the US response costs in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the moment, the company of the family González Sada interjettera appeal at the same court of appeal for the vote to be held in its entirety, that is to say, with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance to pay the non-prospérité and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court had ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on business failures, pointing out that the freed up conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as the paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Moreover, he noted that the country has fulfilled the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pileup of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General assessment </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Complaints from unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the company head, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Trade Unions of Cameras Aviateurs has already encountered problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has come up with a request from the National Commission&apos;s values and who is accused of obstructing justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provides information the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation conducted by the contractor to remove from 61 F / 589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds were used to purchase stocks of the Administration Professionnelles of Hotels. </seg>

<seg id="2856"> As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products from the countries of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees to 150 companies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the Governors of the Southeast zone to oppose the monumental project which lies in part on protected areas and is the largest of all threats to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> Acta is dead </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador from Mexico in Japan had signed the Agreement Commercial Anti-contrefaçon, known by its French acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Intellectual Property Institute, this theme is already history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As everyone knows, this was done while the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Héctor &quot;Hetin Reyes&quot; &quot;The basketball is all my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotteur basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor &quot;Hetin Reyes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage from condemning it in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s&quot;, recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;The basketball is all my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes did not exaggerate when he said that. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia reminiscent of his itinerary out standards, evidenced by. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all his memories, those he relishes the most are those that reminded her stint as a player in the team of the Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;This has been my best years, I have benefited most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team &quot;, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a big player for you, two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow was recommended Raymond gausse, who became a naturalized and who was a better shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember him saying that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship gausse would help us try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He was happy with gausse Vaqueros championship, but only at a distance as in 1988 he was the big brother of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the meantime, he preferred to take advantage of his charges and Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States at the World Cup warming-up tourney • tournament in Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game &quot;, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The 1990 World Cup team is the best national team that you view? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favourite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and that we have taken a beating in the United States team, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who could not attend the global 90 because of a knee problem. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a World Cup warming-up tourney • delight in the tournament of Neuquén in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics in international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Person to Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In young people, I love the work being done by Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What&apos;s next? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are some things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example that the boys Ponce play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the national league. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people travel and play too, though not necessarily needed. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory and certification courses for leaders, the field staff and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been in my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became internationally known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in which he was a businessman without scruples, daunting and manipulator. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R into a new season of &quot;Dallas&quot;, died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production of &quot;Dallas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, regaining the role ironic that he loved the most&quot;, said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who was performing the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it goes much miss them. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional person and he lived life&quot;, Gray said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had acknowledged having much drink for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant liver and he underwent a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Years before &quot;Dallas&quot;, Hagman became known to television in the role of a regular guy in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he was the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius seductive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and return home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He also played in two comedies that have remained little time on air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his film credits include roles well received by critics in &quot;The Group&quot;, &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the delicious detestable Larry Hagman as J.R. reached its greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotion in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in betting. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to that, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers on average before their screens and have made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most watched entertainment in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which was attended by 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was J.R. &apos;s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. had put pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack him. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman played Ewing as corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smile: a contractor dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to commit his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what it would be like epitaph for J.R&quot;, Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> You should write: &quot;Ci-gît the honest citizen J.R. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here are the only party that it has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, recalled Hagman this Friday as a man of &quot;immense, both on screen and in life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The registration of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the moment, neither Warner nor the chain TNT did warn about the way will be incorporated into the death of Hagman in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who found fame with classical works like &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It was there that he met the young décoratrice Swedish interior Maj Axelsson and that he has married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he titled his memoirs &quot;Hello Darlin &apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&apos;: the ruthless memoirs of J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I have nothing written in this book that might hurt someone or affect in any way&quot;, he said to the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to help patients worried. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I advises them, I renewed confidence, I&apos;m with them when they come to operate and after&quot;, he said in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to give them a bit of comfort, like &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid, it will not be easy for a small moment, but it will go well&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been working against tobacco and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course on the &quot;End of the World&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the religious teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;countdown&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, by which many people as evidence of the impending end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited them over the following months: the recent catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the &quot;Armageddon&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time thought to trigger the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that this would be the half the apocalyptic more than I&apos;ve ever known&quot;, said Professor Charmé this week to its students from the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and the You, it has been a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only teacher to teach courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple, the assistant professor Barry vacker provides the course &quot;Media, culture and the end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze this because these ideas abound with time&quot;, he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> Though nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students scan movies with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible&quot;, said vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew Restall Amara Solari, an associate professor of the History of Art and welcomed, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled &quot;The end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add&quot; 2012 &quot;to have the opportunity to run the course again, if the world does not disparaitrait&quot;, said Professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;looming disaster&quot;, students must study, create projects and spend their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In Pennsylvania, the final review will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which the student leaves no other choice than to work &quot;until the night of the supposed end of the world&quot;, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses have proven quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was complete in two hours&quot;, said Restall about his course for students, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the semester, the share of people who asked if there was still space. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, claimed that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It intrigues me to see what people can do to comfort&quot;, says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychologie and Infirmerie 25 years, says viewing all apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this area&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed, much less a teacher, told us believe in the end of the world on 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited&quot;, says Julie zegle, last year at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester. </seg>
