<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to block Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Centre Brennan considers this a myth and says that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in Canada, American states are responsible for the organisation of the federal election in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in the same vein from 2009, a majority of American governments passed new laws that hamper the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Accordingly, during the course of 2011, there were 180 draft laws that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a test of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, these laws reduced early-voting periods, weaken the right to register as voters on polling day and call their right to vote to citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The state of Indiana was the first to demand it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years they have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American people, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity card with photo issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, the search for identity document required costs more than $100. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With the new restrictions, which disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of african-americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters aged between 18 and 29 years do not have an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there are still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In many States, voters who vote for democratic candidates, most students cannot use the identity card with photograph issued by his institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who tend to vote in the Republican Party for using documents issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no State demanded proof of citizenship in order to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to release such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are, clearly, limiting the vote hispano. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws which abolían the registration of voters on polling day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the entrance fee of new voters into 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other States favouring the reduction of the voting period in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were african-american, while they did not represent more than 13% of the state&apos;s voters. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of the Hispanic was exactly the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which equates to 24% of the people who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, who account for 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the people who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this regard, the governors democrats have blocked several draft laws. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The prosecution of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was, in part, to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics denounce Democrats the partisan nature of the laws that have been adopted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Centre Brennan 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the required 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: take the test or not letting? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test of PSA presents, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a good enough reason to doubt the men, already reluctant in itself, on whether or not should be screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We sought advice from two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality among patients who had been made the detection and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, a follow-up to the 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% of potential from metastasis if there has been the detection test. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test at the age of 50 years, or at the age of 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Source african-american as men have a higher level of risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lax. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not violate the long-term life, in which case they should instead opt for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today many men to which they have been detected a cancer are not treated as the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, they suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it proceeds, we offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> See increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should be treated or not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I would do the test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to take the test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in cooperation with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows PSA evaluate the pros and cons of the test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (for the moment only in English, but will be offered translations shortly) along the following lines: http:// ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Preventing disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We estimate that if everyone eat well and would move enough, a 30% of cancers could be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If anybody smoke, that rate would be increased, at least 50%,&quot; underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian cancer society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead, we assess that around 10% of cancers are inherited. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others are still totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the canadian cancer society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is, moreover, a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Does enormous damage people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> A hopeful statistic: 10 years after stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esófago, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Agency recommends, too, limiting the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large numbers, they climbed the risk from a cancer colorrectal. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Prepared meat products should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat for its ahumado, drying or salazón can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;Can damage the body&apos;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; tell us. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, scientists have studied the links between the complex vitamin and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, by the time their investigations are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Segú SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what they observed was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been clearly defined. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Furthermore, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and the family background of each with their doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Do the screening test does not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The bosón Higgs in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the likely discovery of bosón Higgs provoked consternation last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> There is, in fact, that this bosón is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> What is more, the Particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model: our best or &quot;less bad&quot; explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physical is not entirely clear that they Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a doubt that there is a new Particle and that is very close to bosón Higgs predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data disclosed this week in a major conference of physics seem to confirm that it is held in kyoto, although still more data to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong are few. We will see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in the wider world, a general law and inescapable that means that two things must not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way of breaking this rule and not try to do too much, because it will end up getting hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although Particle physics is a very complex world, it has also proved that there is such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;state&quot; which consists basically of some of its features. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists classified particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermiones supporting the principle of Pauli wisely. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And then there are the dirty bosones, a bunch of anarchists that has no respect for all, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website the Particle Adventure of Berkeley laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosones were divided into two groups: the mesones, about which we will discuss here, and the &quot;particles of strength,&quot; for which the great forces of nature spreads and with whom the bosón Higgs would somehow relative. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These exotic bosones, I should underline here, are not the gruesome creatures that we might expect. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this story, it is thanks to a remarkably banal: the bosón fotón or &quot;Particle of light&quot; which acts as a &quot;Messenger&quot; of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when a Particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes direction,&quot; desordena &quot;the electromagnetic field at that very environment; a bit like when we launched a Stone into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;mess&quot; born an electromagnetic wave (of the infrared, ultraviolet light, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a fotón; that is, one of the bosones &quot;proxy force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> Field more stable </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the bosón Higgs, except that this is another area, the field of Higgs which needs to be &quot;messy&quot; for this bosón appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the field of Higgs is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. activarlo requires reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a pond ice cream in which only a heavy rock could slip on the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Why we need a huge Particle accelerator at the CERN (the large hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of girth!) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all the particles and all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, they do, but others don&apos;t: a piece of paper, for example, never keep for itself on the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those which do have a mass, while the rest (how the fotón, incidentally), do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> But what &quot;can bring all these investigations?&quot; asks MS Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also permits that physicists escrutinen differences between the observations and predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For their part, many fervently want are, because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that tape some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, admittedly, still has enormous problems, such as that proposed no explanation on the seriousness (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the area of the universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we found no such differences in the CERN so far. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of these investigations in our daily are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories in no way suspected the revolution that their work would lead. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, as the physical said Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and by the first laser ongoing (the first was pulsados) in 1962, the laser was rather initially deemed a &quot;laboratory apparatus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> Furthermore, applications can also come from the implementation that surrounds the entire investigation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador of light in 1969 in the course of their optical research. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was certainly not his original intention, this captador serves now &apos;eye&apos; for all digital equipment in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC would necessarily transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way to die... | him Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In your committee die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be adopted as it prepares a draft law soon. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this key area, there is still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I Devoir has tried to see it closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. Montérégie lived alone in her apartment. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a break for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years of life, but I have been seven,&quot; relata, made a pass, lying on his bed in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, reached the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, we cannot be ready for this,&quot; continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has ravaged: a huge weakness that prevents him from going only to bath and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting before a apetitoso lunch, accepts resigned to help him eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, it even smile, to talk to the unknown that heaping attention, I bring medicines and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I heal diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; are. informed </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found to remedy this wrong. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pis up,&quot; relata Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the centre Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Return to their childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the person&apos;s ability to accept this regression,&quot; notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of the majority of people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place in the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients entering the heart of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Have a prognosis of life more than three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide care &quot;curative.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of mrs A., 89 years, is dying &quot;conscious and drowning.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made him discover to their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a good child,&quot; adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer are more wishes in this life,&quot; he says, before agreeing that he puts a mascarilla to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> In the coming days and hopes a final visit to her son who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and helps to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Are palliative care being given when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help his death is more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec have a bed of palliative care for each 11.700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Is very little, because we know that we will all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the female doctors of central male. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The dying offer from shenanigans with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> In diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The death is part of the everyday. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening I serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son ended the beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; relata Nathalie Savard, Director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the Centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever be equal. </seg>
<seg id="187"> On the side of a family man of 94 saborea their last meeting in the courtyard, well placed between its almohadas while all drink to his health, a young man of 36 years dies in a tragic, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For the last six months, there are always three to five beds are occupied by people under 45 years with cancer,&quot; Dr. is concerned Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% of canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care designed to alleviate the suffering in hospital when a patient arrives at the terminal stage of his life, is in his home or in a care centre. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several bodies, such as the centre Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of the grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great relative shortage in the health care of Quebec which makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto signed by Balfour of palliative care, as Dr eminences, Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec&apos;s health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before they accept proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Recently,&quot; relata, &quot;I saw a patient spend 14 days on urgencies suffering great pain without there being enough to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists members with their patients until the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low ebb when left a tiring chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that made him great pity that wanted to fight,&quot; relata. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;However, she had said that there was nothing more to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> No all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking die thank their carers who do not have heeded in its demands once they have eased their pain through a palliative care team. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it has to be said that palliative care are absolutely not all-powerful in treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at home of grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatments for pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to sedating palliative, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either permanently or sporadically. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the disease is not relieved to be able to have the sedating palliative. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &apos;I relieve euthanasia,&quot; but &quot;I want.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report has been made possible by a Grant of journalism of research institutes of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Far-reaching scandals property in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP political parties, fundraisers and specialists from the italian mafia, day after day, they do have a formidable &quot;system,&quot; which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry&quot; that was too expensive to taxpayers natives of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how the system is pulveriza once we have shot to the big media,&quot; ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, Member in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to contracts of roads in Quebec, the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than to delay. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts,&quot; contains some of his instincts to stay with a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already laid two mayors,&quot; adds, waiting to get to &quot;show the stratagems existing behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, also applies to his team of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit works in addition to the police of &quot;the firing squad Marteau sewage,&quot; which, since 2009, have made the &quot;cartel&quot; of Montreal was moderate in inflating contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> These past few weeks, the unit has taken the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has now resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, Quebec city third. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected that he pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs have been formally accused of italian origin, as Tony Accurso and flax Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused shock in explaining to the committee the mechanics of &quot;system&quot; for obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid over three years 3% of the value of the contracts awarded in Montreal to a broker linked to the Mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the mayor&apos;s party Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. Zambito distributed money to left and right during the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberal in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He admitted, too, having organised a fundraising illegal for liberal ex-viceprimera minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The inflation in the cost of the contracts sewage </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant exingeniero of public works, explained it well before the committee: in ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000 sewage, all in exchange for contracts whose inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the roads have admitted that received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent in the form of fake extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Moreover, a party organiser, Martin Dumont, accused the mayor M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Political Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected in Montreal that raised an alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies since 2010, in the east of the island, was opposed to the sale of city land acquired by their $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to Developers in the housing boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of the cost of the election campaigns was dirty Money </seg>
<seg id="240"> Of research that will eventually take place, it guarantees that twist &quot;on a knife edge to understand how the system works, infiltrado by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> And added that the process is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices are not repeated. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is concerned about the role of the elected politicians aware of the ploy. &quot;&quot; &apos; </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironiza: &quot;I have said that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government quebequés proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, he said, &quot;while not strictly limit election spending, will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> Recommends a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: &quot;We can&apos;t get any lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the home with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Montreal, Quebec and M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The Barcelona PSG is not the qe!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Could be explained by an individual awareness, but also for the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Have got great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Go from day to day by his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also brought me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And these elements I drive every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a party, that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything moves very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early in the centre of preformación INF Clairefontaine until my time in Saint-Etienne, I always advanced by leaps and bounds. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Will benefit from competition reclutada by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruited this summer are accustomed to play matches at a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player as I wish to fight and take everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Is backed by Deputy as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technical. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no one like in the European league 1 and is among the best coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence we have in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the League 1, Lyon, we took the post of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But remain in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final elimination round in style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have a lot to say to many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against the port to qualify for the final round of elimination round. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Will the PSG can become a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> In economic terms, the PSG is delivered to their means for that project is achieved. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not winning the cup at the 1, and in the league last season, would be a huge failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we will invest all our efforts on lead that title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season do not get far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May we have a disappointment, as had the best position to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, the Montpellier, had significantly better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I think it will be good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect more than PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been spent on the players we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accepted completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After ganáramos 4-0 Troyes at home, that there are things that criticise is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what most people expected. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the qe Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to put in place a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built in time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Just look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for final elimination round, and they also have invested much! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums invested, you imaginaríamos with 15 points ahead of the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship in France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been &quot;driven&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking us the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that gets many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Has been to demonstrate that it is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And he has shown in all the teams it has been a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group that we respect the man and the gambler. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men around them. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all move. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How has experienced the euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> Has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> He was very enthusiastic about participating in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury stopped me scoring game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I was strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today achievement play good matches in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I expected from my baptism with the &quot;bleus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lessons of what happened in ukraine and that is why we today have exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What is your view of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the forefront of the &quot;bleus?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are well situated in the classification for the world group. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The seleccionador is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc clasificarnos achieved its goal for the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps leads the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The standoff (1-1) of 16 October in Spain helped lay the foundations? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought by all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before that shock in Spain, had not experienced a game like this in my whole career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified and the burdens of processing transactions between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Furthermore, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudónimo), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc and a protocol of change in the manner of BitTorrent insurance, which allows the exchange of files on an equal footing. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been close to 200 transactions through 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And about a thousand websites accepted the bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The price of Bitcoin, having risen to the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, today before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Is nothing impressive when compared with the global changes in actual currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) expressed by him in a report on virtual coins issued in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> In it, he described the Bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;that competes with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coins as the &quot;credits,&quot; used to run a vídeojuego and that we can win playing or you can buy (and even sometimes swap). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But in any exchange a central authority monitors and addresses the changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the Bitcoin all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user may choose a different direction for each payment, thereby guaranteeing the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A range of information related to this transaction is concluded electronically through a double key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins appear in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write this new compromise in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a stage of troceado file processing, i.e. a large file in a smaller footprint in numbers and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;caught&quot; the new compromise and add a number &quot;chop up&quot; before the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more noughts initially). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once it is that number, the other nodes easily verify which is good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any change would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to commit a fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very quickly - in less than 10 minutes), the only network would accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would get an orphan, as both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer to resolve the challenge is 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this reward is in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by cienmillonésimo, leaving a large margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also in each increase in the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have stolen bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The ruling does not affect the same protocol used,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium real currency payment, a company that uses the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of anonymous blanquo of money from this service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Players in weight as Wikipedia reject such payments. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the platform Wordpress, the accepted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit rum, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, discussed the book of accounting and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, it launched the &quot;discounts giants.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;It changed 30,000 dollars,&quot; regocija Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which makes the bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat pedagogical, author of a book on the currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier, moreover, manages its identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or softwares. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Simply have to provide a precise direction for a phone to &quot;recognize photographed and logged,&quot; Pierre Noizat, which assures having thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take a while to Bitcoin sets, but in 2013 could be a change,&quot; predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Moreover, in his report, the ECB provides revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that the currency is successful. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We pulled out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the US must leave by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army picked up possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished especially to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the injured and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but also often with peasants who reject the presence of foreign forces, as in the days of the soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if their causes join jihadists, pakistanis, arabs, uzbeks and tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They will no longer be tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, when Westerners get more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops on the basis of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the hills planted almendros thanks to credit French, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The trucks and tanks convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since his breakthrough irresistible between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then vacuum and the country involved in fire and blood because of infighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of its farmers exceeded by the al-Qaeda organisation, but their situation is no better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old mujahedin, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main figures of the anti-soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators, and with government land for solar revenderlos as for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the pair of massive American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Are discredited; most of them do not have fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people I have heard in the countryside, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who were able to take advantage of the American generosity: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are weary of the war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived the modern world for its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and praised its benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> We must give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties and the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. television and its folletines turks with the modern world has great admirers around the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will be deemed legitimate authorities who want to lead the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-soviet struggle have already provincial to reconstitute the militias who huirán of power plant. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform into a centralised state, with a strong presidential power by abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed from the 1964 constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular during the elections due in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, the country relies on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has restored its services, no major has managed no dam and irrigation systems have been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported, and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, would have been necessary government control. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumour that Afghanistan had vast mining wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And this only served to increase the feeling of Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to extract the mineral Iron and copper to the ground and no means of transport for export through the mountains, there are no mining operation. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already have left the copper mines of month Aynak, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) excaven the immense site búdico and remain there as the major employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that largely depend on imports and exports, restore its normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> French troops left on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new Cooperation Agreement provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: girls&apos; schools, schools for children, a French department at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, with the aim of trying to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and making the impossible task of making aid and the offensive action &quot;civilian and military actions&quot; tally, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and did bring in a small French ngo many agricultural collective interest and rehabilitation work in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, golosos to obtain local labour, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation wells, clean water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar and increase protection of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What will continue as memory after two billion in military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often situated over 2,000 metres high. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To break free of the uprising carried out by foreign groups, which farmers have told me that they wish, we need to maintain a small civilian support, well controlled and goes directly to them. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution after a struggle in egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While egypt is more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play the all for the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when it announced that the constituent assembly would vote his final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the Head of State had given two months more to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And nearly two years ago that egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, weakening the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only exacerbated the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the autocratic President persisting in its &quot;delirium&quot; and is &quot;betraying his word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> For his supporters, it says that this is a measure to end more quickly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days should organise a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time that requires the brothers to renounce its project to explain the text, article by article, to the egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the egyptians will vote for it, as stated in an interview with the weekly American time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Considering that the resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people,&quot; or &quot;vote my text or maintain full powers, powers which will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange atmosphere in which 85 members of the constituent assembly, islamist with a big majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The majority of liberals not came to the call. </seg>

<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, st. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of them are citizens of countries of central Asia - uzbekistan, tajikistan and turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Its sole aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December comes into effect a law, whereby each immigrant labour should carry out a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the service sector, domestic institutions of community services, services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, as promise at the federal migration service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>

<seg id="597"> This law will not be subject to the people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>

<seg id="599"> The network of centres examiners will sponsored by the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of peoples, the Moscow State University, Russian st. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants can stand for the tests in all the towns, in Russia are now open more than 160 facilities of this type. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by members of the State Duma and the federal migration service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, were often put this question to the press: What will this actually? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will the terms of knowledge of the language, for both the Russians and the immigrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, are the representatives of the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;slave labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people talk today about the defence of the rights of immigrants, explains labour Victor Sebelev, head of Russia&apos;s federal migration service representation in tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defence of their rights must begin before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organised will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems are immigrants without occupation, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without an understanding of the language, says Sebelev immigrant, the future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping him get an eerie and close a &quot;viajecito paid&quot; covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>

<seg id="612"> Not enoje jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognise that not only do not know the language of the country to go, but in their own language write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not their fault but their own misfortune: few the turkmen people, uzbeks, tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is because their families even have nothing to feed children, let alone vestirlos calzarlos and buy for them what is needed for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> To reach adolescence, these guys have set out to work at the earliest opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if you do not know the language, recognise them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel humiliated and lower.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, when it comes to the law on the language, rights campaigners point to an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they do not have this status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or banned the step to strangers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be done quickly and with only 500 roubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, are not registered and listed the cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;We call 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea,&quot; commented to journalists the citizen of tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Come on, don&apos;t be tacaño, buying a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> The first day of the entry into force of the law on the tongue, it became clear that not only documents of registration of immigrants can be fake. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several certificates&apos; false &apos;knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the federal migration service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The forged documents had been printed in color printer standard. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners not as gift: every immigrant queriéndose facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption for the &apos;diplomas&apos; cannot be bought, meet government officials and rights activists. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities can promise the migrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic course of language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will give them jobs that do not require active communication with the people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with firearms registered is fairly limited </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to gun owners for civil use. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the government&apos;s reaction to the recent incidents: press shot during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre started by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinográdov, which tighten seven people lost their lives. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raising the minimum age for obtaining licence for carrying guns, of 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This view was supported by the head of the state Duma&apos;s Committee on Security and fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised reforms in the law on weapons possession will be carried to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem applying the &quot;Iron fist&quot; policy. </seg>
<seg id="646"> In the social network has published an open letter, whose authors, representatives of organisations of marksmen, need us to desist from such measures of &quot;thoroughness senseless.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their bit. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under cover to the black market, including that of Moscow,&quot; the expert said. </seg>

<seg id="692"> The schemes, he said, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He delivered an album of photos where there was no &quot;all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to Baranets, do not offer to buy a pig in a poke: all that can be proven. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, as a potential customer, not just buy; we are going with the seller to forests, where we put a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon fired well, we started to negotiate,&quot; describes the procedure the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Sofás shop </seg>
<seg id="699"> Web search engines lead to sites and groups of &quot;Vkontakte &apos;, which offers to buy arms for different purposes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> That this does not require any document or personal meetings. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It is sufficient to have a certain amount of money,&quot; they write in the title of the notice advertising &quot;buy a gun or a machine gun.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> There, users make their orders and put questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And sold to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Without permission, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;ivan&quot; (ortografía preserved). </seg>

<seg id="708"> Military commentator and exmilitar Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard of these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People give orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer makes the payment through an atm. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, he sent a photograph and instructions to let them know where the gun is hidden,&quot; The press secretary of the ngo relata &quot;the right to arms,&quot; Dmitri Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets says that if there is an order online, one is left without a weapon and thrown into jail. </seg>

<seg id="722"> Go on strike employees in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as a teller in &quot;McDonald&quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against the corporation Walmart the low wages paid in supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald&apos;s,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell,&quot; &quot;Wendy&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> By now no one dares to state whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if it meant losing strength and amansarse in their early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests have the support of left-wing trade unions and a number of NGOs. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of the modest salaries earned by workers from Walmart and the system of fast food, the aim of the organisers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Forty-six cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The action began last week, after the day&apos;s action thanks, the so-called &quot;Black Friday.&quot; that day, in United States coomenzaba the orgy of cuts that captured millions of inhabitants, and sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and proceeded with trade unions and left-wing activists protest pickets in the shops of the corporation, whose products go to people on modest incomes and moderates. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from nappies, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% lower than those of the major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many low-paid workers of Walmart buy only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and choice of products made of Walmart one of America&apos;s largest corporations. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because paid little for their employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of montacargas or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; the participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it spent on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Within a year they spent the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what they earn now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of happy Walmart commented that the protest took place in only nine States and that caused no loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; took in its stores from Thursday 8 p.m. to midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their cash registers, performed the &apos;Black Friday&apos; boxes nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington post, who left his job &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than &quot;another public relations conjuring trick,&quot; organised by the workers&apos; union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free box!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued in New York this week, in which the targets were not exactly the supermarkets Walmart (which in this progressive city would not have appreciated, and why now there are none), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants cheap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="750"> Let McDonald says that sells billions of pieces, and then even honest you attach the sick leave and you do not pay for your work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, in accordance with federal law and in New York, the minimum wage is 7,25$ per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody earns less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with this money, for me it is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers are having the McDonald&apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school but still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly setback in interviews with McDonald&apos;s workers who complain that they have to live in this salary, and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author says that it is irresponsible to have children if they do not know what to eat. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Those involved in the protests, which began at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday morning in the McDonald&apos;s 40th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, double its current minimum wage for them. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It also demanded that in the fast-food sector workers&apos; unions are created. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the government from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Moreover, the administration are seldom makes life easier. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy for the unions cover the food sector rápid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the biggest is the excessive staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The completion of the action took place at half the rally in the McDonald situated near Times Square, involving several local democratic politicians, in particular the city&apos;s municipal council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it is selling billions of pieces, and then even teaches you a hospital or honest you paid for your work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other leading Democrats, for example of candidate for mayor of the city of New York Blasio Bill, which said that &quot;we must support the workers in the fast food industry to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity they deserve every neoyorkino.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the New York Times described him, this was the biggest demonstration of its kind in the history of the American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But there were only a few hundred people, not even all of them were employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether that will spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For now, trick the brain is not easy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The subject of heightened reality, so popular among fans to modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> In early summer, at its annual conference Google showed a model on the move and then, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted an application to reclaim the relevant patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, in a conversation with the head of Microsoft&apos;s interactive 3D technology group in the laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom dilucidó that that company for scientists, the glasses already belonged to a passing phase. </seg>
<seg id="777"> To them attracts the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please, in general terms, what is the purpose of study of its research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - we are the interaction persona-ordenador, but also try to extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now the humanity in its mass has remained trapped in the stage of work with the flat screen, sometimes the píxeles touches the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the console Xbox and sensors Kinect represent a step forward, and today any Xbox sold without Kinect, because we all care about the control of gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what does the future hold? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - although Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more information), and the exit is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, worked on truly three-dimensional imaging systems, based ​ ​ in various technologies, including the designer. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It must release the world of computers to our physical, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Firstly, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - what do you think about the control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A detail very popular, but do you not think we overestimate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - clear that it cannot be considered a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, if not always wants others to be aware of our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think signs, but not in loose movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Moreover, the gestures were captured by the House of the device, but not by a band that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a watch band. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined rate of control, for example of gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - how is that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - for example, how I would ask you to forward this tin of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You speak and the show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - or do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do at the moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of Sensors that can accurately gauge the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These may be, for example, laser sensors, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - speaking of his work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have complaints from modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do you lack resolution, depth or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - in principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapíxeles at the speed of 1,000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the issue is not the megapíxeles, but on the quality of the matrix and in depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this makes more work for the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and y axes, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also important is the speed, the number of pictures per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are very dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche Redmond, our laboratory, made a sensor processing of contact with adjustable retardation of 1 to 100 MS and it is worth mentioning that the Modern sensor produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction hombre-máquina. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It would be very useful to me in my work an equivalent of such a measure, but that does not require contact to the tables for two more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - and it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared rays and the second recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third chamber is in fact a simple sensor include the standard visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, more of cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the requisite amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be a good idea to create a flexible Kinect analogous, playing with the curvature of location of cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you think that, in terms of daily use of technologies of heightened reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - of course, miss out all day arguing in a smart phone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think that the best option would be a heightened reality &quot;transmutable&quot; when, on the basis of a cloud platform, the smart phone, you could go from glasses </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private things you can only see them), but also its weakness: increased reality based on glasses will not allow it to work on virtual objects along with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holográficos virtual in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film &quot;Iron man,&quot; but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem with this idea that the critics often point out: there is no answer táctil! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers prepares his group for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my conferences often say that the reality is the seventh arrival on the increased interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could well be the addition of sensations táctiles. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand as the anchor for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Has the touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really aimed at bringing tangibilidad to these &quot;images in the air.&quot; for example, the interference of several rays ultrasónicos targeted at a specific point where the blame lies is a feeling similar to that one feels if someone were soplándole yemas of fingers, but that feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the terminaciones nerve of the fingers, this also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - has tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Do you think he feels it seems that she should feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - that is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that will open, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the run - not as the tapes of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For now, fool the brain is not so easy, there is still work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it attractive work with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Personal taste subjective rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the st. Petersburg &quot;Vanguardismo project,&quot; dedicated to the people that are saying, at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of st. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the City: often find recognition in Europe without Russia even the known. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a man barbudo dressed in red from head to toe, which can be found near the Russian museum, near the garden of summer or at meetings of fashion and inauguraciones. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever the display. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of those cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of st. Petersburg, creators of new mitologías. </seg>
<seg id="854"> St. Petersburg Vanguardismo Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative at the end of the 1980s - the early 1990&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Moreover, it is a city man, whose appearance on the streets of the city of people smile and lifts all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, took in their hands a organillo and became the st. Petersburg organillero, as it has matured to make difficult role, for its Bohemian existence, his philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why do you go the city dressed as red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I have been in the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society, everything that is not a little grey prompts aggressiveness and turmoil of properties nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are designed to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when comprendiste debías be artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition of the palace of culture Nevsky, where it but my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free and I were still incomprendidos. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I took a friend of artists in the new wave, with the subsequent to which were referred to in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10,&quot; and the new wave is over. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sumí in the theatre for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not by the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - and this is all juntó in your Art Clinic... - was important for me to be in the cultural centre of St Petersburg, where they were to gather together the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and, while there was no reforms, there was a musical art club, a club bohemio, the home of the St Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms Tequila, Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to &quot;van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and her friends danced under light songs phonogram vestían tight trousers, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play in alive, became &quot;leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg cheerleader was of many programmes before the days of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> I gave Trachtenberg and was the start of his great career; basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> &quot;D 137 gallery,&quot; the &quot;club Griboyedov, are the remnants of the clinic&apos;s art. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were assiduous our employees and customers. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was &quot;the people of our City.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In nominating &quot;artist of the Year&quot; elected I ended my completion. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In this new era is not comfortable work; I am a man he likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our time is easy to be popular, but the culture and the popularity are separate. You can be popular but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - there are in your work something recognisable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - many of my paintings are hits, which clearly expresses the topical and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to make a scheduled exhibition,&quot; the Russian Museum in clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I was previously sociable, but now it is painful and terrifying. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But everything in the clowns embadurna and tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love my mind the grotesque, grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through compulsory totalitarian and a change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now you are by the clothes, moving it outside, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And perhaps that person not to shake hands, but he should escupirle in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deceit will be abolished when they change clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - you saw recently in the role of urban organillero. - A cultured city must have a hero as well. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than me to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> But - well, perhaps the art trade can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - now the art trade must be careful, sweet, having tact. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the unraveling of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people are agrupaba in herds, the bohemios wanted one thing, the simplones others. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is hard to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a $100 ticket for taste at all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we need to think about who you want to please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every hero worship has its 100 fan. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - will see the abandoned, there is the sexo-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event are 300 people, 10,000 never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marchita. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I hold my fan, the most important thing is not deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young had a coleccionista possess such paintings hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which people usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Say spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint charts. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is it that is missing in St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - good experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can go to culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the kings were the right there was another way, kings may not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow there is now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St Petersburg that could well be experts, but they are closed, because it requires experts at a higher level to evaluate them properly and I open way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> It is now thriving the subjective personal taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that all modern art is not accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - what is it for you St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. in Moscow there is much more culture, there are ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural and we now have more writers than readers, that is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We have to make the art of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The draft was presented with a subsidy of st. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The land is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or an asteroid strike killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space craft with humans on board are in search of a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To preserve mankind is the main question: how do you continue the species in terms of atmosphere or replacement on the same planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is little choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;These are Venus and mars,&quot; says the chief investigator of the astronomical Institute state, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus is the temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago that were conducted experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit is not diferenciaban land on none of the species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, were sent into space quail eggs to check how the embryo develops in terms of atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Get as a result a normal polluelo. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that this polluelo must find support, must stand on its own feet and start moving,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev laboratory, the director of the institute of biomedical problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By not find support, the polluelos gave volteretas at random. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 p.m. in the newborn was a total atrophy of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The polluelos not they reacted to light or sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the misfortune was that after four days simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice we were born the polluelos, but then we leave because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the polluelos in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time a &quot;biological&quot; miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the biosatélite Bion &quot;only will travel species of the same sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the area with foetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;This was precisely in the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and Vladimir Sychev studies like this should be done,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Space after the landing, the rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it has not yet managed to address the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, having lost their usual habitat, simply cannot make their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has the right emotional abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a fund. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar tests are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel into space 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious thing that humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gaviota flying, and no one on earth could say: if it is after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> May or may not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, nobody has responded to this question,&quot; he says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just after a year of the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, also was a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open area, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> There are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights have been well, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if I may say more, it is dangerous even in flights orbitales,&quot; summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, mankind must find some new avenues in biotechnology, in the radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The centre&apos;s hidrolaboratorio cosmonauts is a mandatory in the preparation stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Under conditions of flotabilidad void, the cosmonauts practise their skills to work in the area. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water it pretends the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile environment, for a newborn child is his native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, because then it will be easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, swimming monitora of newborn babies. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the political atmosphere is a more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the atmosphere the muscles abdominales and pelvis decrepitan very rapidly, the ability of expulsion from the foetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we ignore this, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will drive. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot; Valeri Polyakov is this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Furthermore, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the sense of gravity, the body does not produce the skeleton and the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> For a child born in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a special suit for exercises, as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is merely strip of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment we will do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring to the land to a disabled person, a person totally unsuited &apos;, provides for the head of the bioethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in the area is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time it will become a reality, when human beings in their houses are directed to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of nkú: inspection of the political system &quot;švarc&quot; has not found the culprit </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good quality inspectors and legislation, although its implementation falls. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> It says Mr Kala, Vice-President of the office of supreme control (nkú) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be right.&quot; This is, in my opinion, what we need, &quot;describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The joint inspection of the inspectors czechs and germans come to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of a bad practice, says Petr Nečas&apos;s attitude to the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;švarc system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would have annoyed entrepreneurs with inspectors. So it is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be regulated in some way and if ban something, in this case, neither the Prime Minister can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations,&quot; notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the committee&apos;s attention of control in the Congress of Deputies, spoke of the joint project between the Czech and the German team, within the framework of which was likened the legislation concerning public procurement procedures in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control we make about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Put simply: European legislation regulariza how to organise a public procurement procedures, this follows the existing law in each country, and then the practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have united and, although control is not yet finished, we got very interesting differences. Generally, the law of our country is &quot;tougher and more comprehensive,&quot; however, specific practice in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can bring to this project? What you think are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Exactly a joint control of this kind could help that we failed to invest efforts to implement the laws, the reduction and improvement of the limits, although this will not have a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of savings mean getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which means that the price is not always the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not just for the sake of reducing the limit in procurement procedures means that we will achieve this. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated with both &quot;red tape,&quot; that those who want to find flaws in the system can do it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &apos;s attention about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the prácticaa of public procurement procedures. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of controls in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is it an office like our nkú or is organized differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> How much at the office, such as the nkú, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of auditors), with a similar to our organization, with a school, it is just that in his case is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the powers are to some extent analógas, however, as Germany has a federal structure, the courts of auditors are even at this level. Here differs slightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are in the Federal Court of auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation, is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Usually, I would draw a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some ways, but you cannot accurately specify in what is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That certainly not, but, again, I do not like to make such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It must be said that even those countries that take as a model must face a number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If not, do not pose any real benefit collaborate with our office, do you not think? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office&apos;s amendment law on public procurement procedures? is somehow its incidence? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been demonstrated on the actions of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Given that we ex post controls, there need to be a delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, it is in the process of preparing future controls: &quot;We have launched a new tool to detect risks not economic,&quot; for which we did spend nearly 14,000 public contracts, which have been tested. The changes will be perfectly at home here, as are the limits, are adjusted for certain types of the selection process and similar conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it does. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the rules &quot;strengthened&quot; and it is impossible to deliver. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the old rules, people already controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every law not respected in matters of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense then toughen the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attacking or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> What emerges from this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> See where this road leads started. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would have annoyed entrepreneurs with no controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper, what does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Does the system švarc &quot;it is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be regulated in some way and, if ban something, then even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Can say: &quot;change the law and allow,&quot; but you cannot say that we will do as usual. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the Law on Public procurement procedures, the regulations are quite strict about the way in which it must act formally. And that is as it should be to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be right. This is, in my opinion, what we need. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads are passable, although most of them are ice plates </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places in the Czech Republic roads are plates of ice and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Although most of the tracks are passable, in some particular care should be careful. </seg>

<seg id="1108"> It is just one of many such alarmist news to which we like agarrarnos. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The Group of the music tap tap we like rather to make jokes about this music and we like to say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in December organizáis a truly original project: three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you explain it to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charitable Act state have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the potential of marketing that is the end of the mayan calendar enunciated 11:10 a.m. on 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, on 20 December at 9 p.m., organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Kiribati will be around the same time that the mayan calendar ends on the island, in the Pacific ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, after we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state as we leave the world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of original articles: shoes, t-shirts, bags and key rings at the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another form of support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group the tap tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled &quot;end of the world, cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the beneficial concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course we do, and it will be just the latest, well, if all goes well and is not the end of the world... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The cantarán all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems enlazarán each other simultaneously with the special broadcasting live on Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tomáš Hanák wrote the lyrics of this song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in the complete with, where also sings Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Work together with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organising many charitable acts and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put every effort to participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and entertaining them work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will be the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> With equipment for the educational Center without walls Studeo we term in its sixth consecutive year with civil partnership tap in Jedličkův ústav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils at the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly the visit of teachers with the performing amusing and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students do not have sufficient financial resources to pay for teachers and do a efuerzo to make that possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building that we we will convey to this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert act several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Try to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support Lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>

<seg id="1140"> Do you have plans to take another &quot;spectacular&quot; similar action in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May go for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here probably will prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also touch on the Bohemian national Hall in New York and to me personally, while we are in the United States, I would be complemented by action in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so difficult that may seem at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five Member in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel for luggage in the hold and also carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, so far we have fared well. čsa and British Airways were fully prepared, which never ceases to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently come back, went smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What I have found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In London, luxembourg, Madrid and other cities, everything works better than here; we have seen that in Russia, in the East, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike in Prague, Moscow is full of obstacles, there is still not often that a person moves alone for the centre of the city in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as ordinary as, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in a lift, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, it has created a civil partnership that strives to focus attention the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Where do we must follow the example of more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many ways in which we are behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the refinement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability go it alone in public and can go to the service to the museum, wherever... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very often that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with the tap tap going a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in which arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, really will change everything. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of character. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group the tap tap is now very popular, but looking a few years ago, what led you to form the Group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered as educador Jedličkův ústav, where he was quite young people around me who wanted to engage in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am musician, raised, among others, the amateur saxofón, founded a group with a work colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And over time, as our moderator says Láďa Angelovič, there was a little out of hand (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work is not, it is as if there were no. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> You had intended to go so far with the tap tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the outset I saw he had potential, that something can be done otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment industry is full of things that resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its own way, everything new is cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that the tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who see us for the first time is clearly the compassion, it is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not left to suffer and the beings that we have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and developed, provided, of course, that has the necessary means. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Did the fact that many people&apos;s attention is a demanding boss, as he describes? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do an excellent job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demanding discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with its head in the clouds and when they hear that they must come two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend much time travelling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently the group the tap tap has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group open, people enters and leaves, cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who will and desire will always open doors </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Will take place in Prague, Brno and Plynojem Fléda in Ostrava Incheba sand and included 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via videoconference with together to sing the song of the group the tap tap &quot;end of the world, cancelled &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to bring together the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of educational centre without barriers Studeo in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, Czech whose cost amounts to 25 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of selling early in Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week agreed to Poland as a 12th Member of this. Is the second Member of the bloc that country in Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started strong collaboration with the esa in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the Commission of the agency projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, Poland&apos;s path to the cosmos began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The Polish enthusiasts already went to flights into space before the Second World War, although not always understood their work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the Conference of A.\ xC5 ternfeld in the astronomical observatory of warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study &quot;introduction to the cosmonáutica.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left indifferent assistants and, years later,\ xC5 ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the one who had shown interest in her work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In the year 1934\ xC5 ternfeld won in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his &quot;introduction to the cosmonáutica.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and the cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Published hundreds of articles in magazines Polish and wrote a number of books on this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonáutica, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the cráteres of the dark side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Back in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was to be provided with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> It is unknown who was the author of the proposal and does not know the destalles project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for the start of dresina or for braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information on this dresina is confined to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the material preserved, it is evident that the investigation came to the stadium of testing practices. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of German troops, was interrupted research. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In the year 1937 appeared in the farming press the prototype of a missile of hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna R rakietobomba lotnicza,&quot; the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Provisional shortly before the war, the scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) took care of all the projects of missile technology for military use and coordinated all of the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies on the Polish cosmonáutica appeared in the press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish society of Astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy first referred to society with four articles very extensive devoted to the Astronáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to the cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a forward-looking discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 Polish society Astronáutica (PTA) aspired to be part of the international federation of Astronáutica (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice-President of the International federation of Astronáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Played this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA participated in a meaningful way in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which was carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a peak of 1.8 metres, about 80 cm and not reached the 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, it ended the RM-1A version of building and testing began in the summer of 1959 Błędów two-stage rockets RM-2 air in the desert. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket, measured 1.4 metres and he weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of rocket under development would be subject to real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 was to have a peak of 14.5 km and their mission would be monitoring the wind up. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, in 1962 were suspended business. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor to the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> They developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A -1B and -1C), diferenciaban each other for the space available for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the rocket was Meteor-1A space available in the volume of Meteor-1B 0.4 litres, it is 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The height was possible in the three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between the years 1965 and 1968 was developed at the aviation institute the rocket Meteor-2 airline, whose first trials started in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> We must also mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for space research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> As part of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of Soviet cósmico on artificial satellites and space, in 1978, the year the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law traabajos social. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution was a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Existing will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a wider level. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means that the different ways economic and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, along with the unbridled speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the big differences in the cost of labour (salaries) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with imports of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for that &quot;causes a bajadda &apos;the price of competitor with the aim of taking the lion&apos;s share of the market and thus increase their profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale means, for the majority of employers, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, nor is it necessarily responsible for this phenomenon creates, growing unemployment social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation brings the total disregard for employers to pay taxes and offset the economic and social damage that caused in their pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so universally known that there is no need to submit specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Little escrupulosas practices of private capital creates situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the standard of living of the population itself and thus attract foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is evident especially in the changes to the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially when it comes to wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of employees on labour rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years in Germany, there are points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot stay with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people receiving this type of aid arrives at the million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing competitiveness of the German economy, there is a case quite frequent: people with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to get to a bare minimum to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It issued a scandal of this type on the situation of junior employees of the German Federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The savings of almost all the southern States of the EU, without a doubt, lead to the same situation. persons, pressured by a dismal decline of its social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with an appalling salary on the fringes of society, in the hope that one day reaches the country private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary preguntrarse comes from where? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the case in question from other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or is never, as Chinese, turks, moroccans, egyptians, Indians, brazilians or African still work for a tiny portion of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the media ad nauseam claim that the state should not bring capital into the economy, to manage the economy leads to failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private equity defends tooth and nail the theory that the state should not intervene in the economy meddled in the own control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then, the question arises whether the private capital with its political selfishness in the March and, therefore, not influence the entire state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all the States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that exists in the field of corruption, in the mutual favours, in legislation that is pretty damning everywhere but it is not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is this: the state ministries, for lack of funding, the drafting of draft laws to do private law firms, which are often linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> In this way, all power emanates from the people, not as announced in the constitutions of the Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that liberal democracies with a guideline are quickly into a situation that describes how Appiános in his play the crisis of the Roman republic in times of caesar and Pompeya: &quot;the state was disintegrating and authorities were working to force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favors achieved illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption spread and people acudía no impediment to the polls with the vote... &quot;there were people with character aspirara apalabrado beforehand for a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the State spent eight months without consuls...&quot; began to talk seriously of autocracy was the only remedy for a situation as serious and one had to choose a strong man... &quot;although Appiános thought in Pompeya caesar, rose to power and transformed forever democracy in autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, just as in the old, is that today&apos;s society is based on individual preferences insensitive of profit without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is not capable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without making an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the rise of fascist and Communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy of sorts, as a distinct break, waiting for the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The really damning fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have seen, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the standard of living of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the involvement of the state&apos;s capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (there is no violence and no could do so), sting in his song fragile and whose refrain: &apos;Let&apos;s do not forget how fragile we are&apos; (let us not forget how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my children did not want war, there would be no&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his death bed in the year 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, on the side of Israel, argued in favour of the right of self-defense and encasilla to palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports to the palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, accusing Israel of state terrorism and genocide perpetrated against palestinian arabs. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the killings which occur regularly and who is the victim. After all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the Autonomous territories, born within the current political situation and not lived the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who take advantage of the tensions that are dragging on for 95 years (measured from the 1917 Balfour declaration, in November) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my observations are based on historical facts, other conclusions that I arrived on the basis of my own way to understand the issue, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of mankind&apos;s history of the struggles for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Every time we can find an Alexander the Great or a napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is no longer so clear is whether these characters were always the directing his footsteps autonomously or whether anyone behind his throne had aimed its actions toward a specific goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of power and money that this implies, has not been able to get in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Astronomically wealthy stresses that could be considered the most prominent of these families (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but do not rule that out): the Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 1990s the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating its name with very serious criminal acts. The power and wealth, or both, I covered the back, which for them always meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Have major stakes in almost all the world&apos;s central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, or is preparing a war has been declared: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing gaddafi only four, but Russia has since remained subject the Central Bank to the Russian Government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central bank&apos;s the Rothschild, Bank of America began during the war of secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Jfk began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (edf) and was assassinated in 1963; congressman Louis erm Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after trying to Sue the FED for having triggered the great crash 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Its global thirst for power led them over the years 1859 - 1871 to devise a plan with three world wars, devised by the masón Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was set as an objective of eliminating the big royal states across Europe; the second would eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third was aiming to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (this amount of slaves to their well-being and luxury sufficient energy and not so many resources), in addition to the creation of a world religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a settlement) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group operates from richer families, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamic of the onset of crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (ab order cao - order out of chaos.) </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are, however, always wrong, and carry a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created not to allow a crisis such as the 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, following the success of the assassination of the heir to the austro-hungarian throne, Franz ferdinand in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the First World War broke out, trashed the tsarist Russia with the start of the bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified militarily and economically, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the tsarist Russia were unnecessary) and the subsequent break-up of the great power of central Europe, the austro-hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To prepare the ground for the second world war, allowed bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a difficult situation in the wake of the massive war reparations imposed on Germany, which were created optimum conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses, then I was enough to the germans the Führer&apos;s solution, which was strong enough and simple and noted to blame, and then build a czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities represented so well and with a strong German minority who should play the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild led the foundation of the zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with jerusalem as its capital - return to zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration, laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to palestine and began the first conflict with the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Produced terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The World War II erupted: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too of the rope that had drawn international bankers in principle or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created optimum conditions for accepting the jewish state in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which repairs of war imposed on Germany paved the way for the second world war, with the declaration of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers winning start, the jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the generally Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. For example, take the divide so blunt sympathizers and opponents of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict? where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether it was at the beginning of all the greed of some individuals and global thirst for power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point we must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers just before their candidates in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, which makes every effort to declare war on Iran, and, given that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would become a global conflict and, bearing in mind that Iran controls the strait of hormuz, through which passes 20% of all oil shipping corridor (the world has only two miles across), would lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In light of what are now the speech David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in his imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every new individual he shoots a chip at birth that controls all your being. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And requires all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to a mark on the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand: anyone with two fingers in the face, which leads the numbers of this monster. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The number marks to the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Film Argo: if it is crude, draws on Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 the manifestation of a group of islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release would be in exchange for destronado Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to us, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation for the American administration did not offer any positive perspective: throw the Shah overboard could not afford it, because, if it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available to us. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which then escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were released imprisoned 444 negotiating days after the intervention of government of algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The failure in Iran has played a decisive role in the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film &quot;Argo&quot; the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before holding the embassy, escaped six employees of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a complicated voyage, ended in the residence of the canadian Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA covert, in collaboration with the canadian authorities, managed to keep them out of Iran, this was a story a flamboyant point: film came with canadian passports, as members of a team looking at the location in the country for making an overproduction of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Gender mix </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan drew the expert in &quot;slipping&quot; Tony Mendez required cooperation again Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> So that the lie seems accurate, wrote on the film project in specialist magazines, press conferences were organised, the society of fictitious production had even a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck&apos;s film is a unique combination of various genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called &quot;caper movie &apos;, the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series ocean&apos;s rise). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film are moods. are on the one hand sequences well documented in Tehran. In the flagship credit sequence shown photographs of the time of the events, which were enshrined in the same way in the film; there are not many differences here. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other, scenes typical of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Furthermore, scenes from the centre of the CIA and other institutions: men trajeados that analyse the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been subjected to ridicule, has become a respectable director and its behaviour has ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> It is his third largometraje, small after &quot;goodbye, goodbye&quot; (2007) and the thriller the town. &quot;city of thieves&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film from Affleck in which the action takes place not in the city of Boston, where they raised me. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Furthermore, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature of putting old movie directors over standards of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck demonstrates in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;wheel&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of events truthful. The introductory sequence of the takeover of the embassy is impressive for its capacity sinóptica trasmite which, at the same time, the thrill of uncertainty and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators achieves a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the team imposter in the bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that a story explained film does not offer much in the way of the scenes most intriguing. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here is not quite so elegant (the scene when crises hit at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the pursuit after its runway become crazy). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the fact that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman has a very funny role as participants from Hollywood, although its characters deserved more space and are certainly not alone in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little hint of drama, but it is a film to proceed with a moderate interest, assess their performance and style retro thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But that collapses, it will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a true story and exaggerated as evidence of how that can be the notions of omnipresence and omnisciencia of the secret services, is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for the bloated balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year submits a survey on bank charges more absurd, has now decided to announce the competition on &quot;the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU&apos;s workshop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;It happened after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a 40% quota for women in management positions in large European companies,&quot; explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurd nonsense &quot;is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women are aventajaban of objectively better prices in life insurance because they represent a lower risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at the end of February 2013,&quot; reported Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations in the EU is mandatory, for example, the addition of biocomponentes fuel that, as a result, damage to the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or guideline sombre the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The ban has been criticised factual use the expression &quot;butter,&quot; or the withdrawal of the traditional light bulb in the shops. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The apparatus of the Union takes such decisions often under pressure from either commercial or industrial lobbies, whose demands in Brussels are normally held by any State or group of states - the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that the best quality bananas should take in the EU a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not present &quot;curvaturas abnormal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonise national rules not homogeneizadas to date, which only complicaban marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules relating to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been watered down on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edible. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the US last year under which the balloons inflables traded is mandatory warning that children under 8 years are not allowed to inflarlos without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU referred here to an American study under which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is also present a similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children of up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Curious Ocurrencias born even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. Not to offend the sensitivities of Greece, should we talk of former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominó in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU ruled the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Later, the Czech Republic went through, for example, the required amount for canned mushrooms, which he had a substantial threat of fines. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> To the organisers of the survey were also interested the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of providing funding for the Grant application. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas were not in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are disadvantaged by the fact of not having sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We call on the European Union compensation,&quot; declared in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture Minister Jaroslav spades (čssd). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued with the fact that in our country they produced much grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention buying, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to spades, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of grain from those countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy to receive a Grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is bound to the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: rare prescriptions are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the Member States are often targets of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to some experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the recovery of EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have made in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The czechs also have the heartstrings, in the same way as other countries in the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has always come out well in these pugnas. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The czechs, after six years of disputes with German and austrian, successfully defended the designation of origin of requesón Olomouc, but had to go ahead and change its name to national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as &quot;tuzemák.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only products made from already distilled from sugar cane can be so-called rum, but not those made from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the EU&apos;s official list of protected designations of Origin, together with the feta cheese and gorgonzola known around the world, the German town mazapán Lübeck or Parma ham, already include for example the biscuits Karlovy Vary žatec Pohořelice, carp and Třeboň and, indeed, the variety of hops. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how he happened to run in the elections for President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not to be Senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If it were all right, then I would submit my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I cannot bear to see stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Had no ambitions to be political. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something that I do not like, trying to come up with a solution to change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to stand as a senator or President. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senate has already arrived, but soon after has been on the way to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is he not turning their backs on those people who voted? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later stated that if was elected Senator, would present my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my aim is not the role; the role is the tool with which I can make my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we are a nation that we in the bar or in front of the television, but we ride roughshod over anyone who wants to start a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the media, you discredit and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me is said to have bribed to journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek adviser. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It is presented to the presidential fight with thesis financial and criminal accountability of politicians and the declaration of property over $20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> That must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As the President does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How can you resolve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby group for the job of guide to be recognised as self-employment, and we did. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, is about and this affects the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all the groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without encasillamientos or party dogma, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Is it more a man of right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people I considered more left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important, be it a little left or a little right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters to me is that we come out ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always support openly any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal from the ksčm or the ODS and, in the same way, I am against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> A joke&apos;s attention when it says that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing on what he says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When it creates a business plan for the company, you have certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try acercarte to them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some will call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke already operate in the world or known experts talk about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament only remain slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And so cannot survive in the long term policy. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that if he is going to people and talk to them, will, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my part to achieve this. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If elected President, there would be no problem to organise a broadcasting live on television to urge the leaders of the parliamentary parties legitimaran criminal responsibility for financial and political, state officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they would have to communicate why do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character who says disputes, it can put pressure on the political stage. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for instance the direct election of the President, who has been an achievement of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I say that I am just an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my views and ideals attempt seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I start in politics and try to get the broadest possible support for my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Try getting things through myself, but if it is not well, in six years I will leave and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Sounds a bit like Okamura outside to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that with someone I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if perhaps animaran to submit his nomination to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had much work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which brought to light the fraud with heating oils light. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I stood on the basis that people are really disappointed, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of the population turned out to vote, and those who did not, voted for representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People chose the Senate, so that will be difficult to achieve change. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering forming his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet seen it because I do not have time to check on flawless potential of each of the members of the party, nor have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind open there are only 20,000 kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Has no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Talk of statements of property, how is it yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property in some 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague have a ground valued at 25 million, a flat worth 10 million, another apartment tasado in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, a Aston Martin of around 3.5 million and a\ xC5 koda Superb valued at one million, and I have a couple of million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I have a Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting the evil words and deeds and injustices. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Will lead a Aston Martin, their property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> &apos;s attention says he wants to change the Republic but does not put too much money on their side. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I don&apos;t have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign have already made 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that there is no sponsor shows that there is little interest in my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The costs of the campaign covered in essence we get in the form of salary of Senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live. For example, could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I just make money, then I do not present as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So we will continue with their business to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Is it not said earlier that he was going to stop this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has nothing to do with a higher salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, in part I made my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People wanted to be the samaritan salvase the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How accustomed to win monthly as a businessman? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, which still winning. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If he were President, then leave the business. </seg>

<seg id="1509"> To counter this embarrassment, some years ago we decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven bridges fake euro notes are represented in the form of concrete miniaturas armed decoradas. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive education was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And that was how policymakers decided that there was a possibility to improve the statistics - we had to build a Library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of the Dutch study of architecture MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for buildings fun while cynics, took issue with his usual calm and came to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face. </seg>

<seg id="1526"> In raising the view may come to see the Park&apos;s benches, dogs and children playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all around books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the shelves of books are prepared over the facade and the centre was opened a huge dark room that generally tends to be rather awkward and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done is to upside down the classic shape interior space and make the area of reading abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The Interior of the mountain is very well taken: in the middle are the offices, the Library of the Internet, the chess club, the Center for environmental education and the maintenance room. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> The black shelves deserve special mention to assume the functions of coating mural, parapeto barandilla and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, touch and the nostrils are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the civil engineers and architects more up-to-date shake their heads when they hear talk of this material is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst Spijkenisse, head of the project in the town. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And that is how one day, in a farm friesland, we have the right by-product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the netherlands a few millimetres thick plastic fabric is used as a basis for secured the roots of crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the Library this fabric prensó, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain planks of four centimetres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and the pressure, the so-called plastic agricultural (KLP) color changes and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smacks of a mixture of new car and zapatilla of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 rungs get to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this route of continued almost 500 metres around the mountain lies the reward: from the bar is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but also that it can enjoy the delicious Dutch croquetas and its ficus planted in huge pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a congenial atmosphere to the couple who keep the right atmospheric moisture to this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for a new Soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;Although perish the thought given its large there, this building is an exemplary project glass surfaces which on the ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heating and cooling needed gained from geothermal power. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even in the more sunny days the sun shines only for a few hours in his home. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The enormous wooden cerchas located across the facade of glass used to shadow and absorb most of the rays of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a climate comfortable home. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is left to pull the shutters automatic. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the sceptical of information technology worker, already has dared to get a foothold in the new Library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Equally, the traditional Chinese medicine Professor Cynthia Bogarde try has visited the Library. It calls the &quot;Boekenberg late &apos;and the&apos; soul &apos;of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, at which took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book of his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> In this way is to fill a Library, optical moment, the gaps that still does not have its entire archive; currently has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a Library half empty,&quot; says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that thanks to our initiative all the people now have a certain affinity with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the Library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although he is only there to embellish. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in that discipline prevails in the specialist argot is known as &quot;creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece in the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Regardless of how young and inculta that may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally a starting point to shape its identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The germans must play a more substantive role &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US relations. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position rather trickier. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: earlier this week, Germany hinted they would vote against the proposal to Grant the palestinians the status of observer state of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe it supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the political upheaval in libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was was to establish a zone of flight ban. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> It has finally been declared by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany finds it difficult to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because it is currently with his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Of them are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think we still are operating extremely close to what its role, but have already begun the journey towards a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What &quot;normal&quot; means a foreign policy from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different to the United States and its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Are these economic interests have influenced the position regarding the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason must be careful and not alienate itself from the Arab public opinion, nor of Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give such importance as it is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, we play a fundamental role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has undermined its relationship with us to abstain from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a great deal of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a break as drastic as in the case of libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, it has only show that it is a country that, taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, US was clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disparity of views between us and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been these disparities due to American domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I think that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion really does not have the scale attributed to him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu: Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does Germany finds it difficult to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course it would be a little easier for the germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior being, but must push things from its own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, simply because of the link to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a thorny issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the germans have clear that must play the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Is Germany itself in the role of major international player? would in fact Germany take a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or maybe it is still proving difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet been used, it is always a little embarrassed and, for obvious reasons, it is costing the country to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see every time Germany positions itself as a major player, loosened some antialemanes feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than us. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Must show a receptive attitude to the differing views and neighbours and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of us in European politics increasingly falls, but the EU does not cover that gap, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The germans will have no choice but to take a more central role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not, if it is unpleasant or if you become a people even more unpopular, C&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is executive director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analysed together the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall fund, which specialises in German policy, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks in China:&quot; When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani pole? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After this name is a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, there is protection while the real epónimos not submit a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear that they will agree. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch&apos;s lawyer, law firm Taylor Wessing specialised in protection rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week a new case reaches my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The Putin imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also copy legally in the same way, as has happened to sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a archivador in which holds seats of the trademarks bureau in beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company called registering the brand Zegna DF Puma artificial, a name that is also served in the House of fashion Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are world champions in this of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the cities there are large stores of various plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, cases of Pattloch are of a different kind. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademarks bureau officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it, &apos;Bang Ming Pai &quot;or accompanying brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word comes from the Chinese word &quot;Bang Dakuan,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That refers to women who have &quot;fish&quot; to a wealthy man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for the business, we have to fight this,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is broken, the monopoly position disappears and the damage of the image is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the coast of procedural billions of sectors are affected, especially in the case of luxury flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of $15 billion per year in size, China is the third of luxury goods and the fastest-growing market. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, achieving the annulment of inscriptions of dubious legality in the register of brands is complicated and also makes a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can be extended to nine years and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a demand that so much time had passed the name to the already had become a &quot;fact of market demand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;If the complainant is bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process that has damaged the brand in China,&quot; says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has recently been taken over by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why today the Chinese can continue using a very similar to the star of Mercedes emblem. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, he initially used a blue and white logo that largely BMW; the matter is dirimió in court and Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against Putin imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which represented a turning in the opposite direction to the original crocodile logo. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The trademarks bureau CTMO in beijing recognises that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however,&quot; The emergency labour returned to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the number of complaint processes without processing has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57, 000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 claims are still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Combating this costs a lot of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is customary in China, the numbers are striking. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It is a new record and means that China champions for the tenth consecutive year the list of new applications throughout the world, notes the trademarks bureau. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in concept of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, this means that on average each Registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Combating that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years the Chinese group fighting in the courts against a copier. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation spare car, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copier has managed to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and adviser Freudenberg delegate chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The trademarks bureau CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the subsequent two bodies have given him right Freudenberg, but the other side still struggling today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We must be extremely careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which remains outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to settle for the point and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also says that &quot;the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the archive business has had to review files of up to 100 years old to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other side a &quot;sum of EUR six figures in&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but failed. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much we care,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten to overtake Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Particularly if the Putin imitators will assure there duties on not protected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group long ago abandoned this commercial area, but failed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It has to be extremely careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies that are extremely cautious about doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on the international law on the rights of brand, but what we have to do is &quot;record in China everything which may also be eligible for protection,&quot; as noted Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, would then have to pay the other side licence fees on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question us expulsarían market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: dance, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg is trying the chorus Imbongi and rejoicing in swaziland AIDS orphans </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a link to overcome much more than 8.733 kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, tacón basketball shoes, shoes and mocasines looking up on the parquet floor, and find them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of singers (contralto, low, tenor and soprano) arremolinándose entorpeciéndose and siguiéndose each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the Director of 29 years, threatens to get almost of their boxes to bring order to his vigorous and gentle gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human genetista until the house husband. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om Obani &apos;&quot; is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and in a foreign language barely known: the zulú, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and swaziland in some areas. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate by unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>

<seg id="1715"> In swaziland there are 245.000 orphans of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is already positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The partnership voices for Africa has found in Germany Esitjeni godparents to the village&apos;s 180 orphans of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> By 15 or 20 per month you can endorse a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the plate of school, the uniform and guarantee him a warm meals per day in the Gogo center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Stories &quot;or&quot; panegirista Imbongi means in zulú &quot;storyteller.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody in this Chamber knows speak fluently this bantu language, but claim they know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Ten years ago this chorus is trying songs in this soft foreign language which can sometimes carry them to their place of origin: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> 8.733 miles away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni depends on the voices of this German Choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The 40 percent is infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple shacks of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Esitjeni is a small example of what affects swaziland - the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The people struggled with circumcision, a practice which has been shown reduces by half the risk of contagion. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of people in swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than 30 years has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered this recóndita population, but above all that we saw were many children in the streets that were not only from the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothes and training. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> School with no qualifications, the possibilities in a poor country are more than SLIM. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was just the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child outside the College and disfrutara a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, a year after the chorus founded the association &quot;voices for Africa that since then there has been&quot; professionally for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the ETS of bacterial origin are the syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The ETS from vírico more common are AIDS, the papilloma virus, the herpes genital or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The ladillas and sarna are among the ETS spread by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups of affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and the gonorrea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute works on the assumption that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are more common chlamydia infections, tricomonas, the papilloma virus, the candidiasis (hongo) and the gonorrea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European poll, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the papilloma virus also adds to the most prevalent diseases among the young. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has changed the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections continues a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate that it is a disease venérea? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, trouble urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampollas or verrugas. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore not detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infections by physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, experts recommend regularly subjected to medical examinations, especially if we change often of sexual partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The majority of the ETS can be cured if diagnosed early, and it is possible to avoid any result late. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees they charged the chorus for its actions across Germany, coming to collect enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In total we have had about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni proud,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the very people Zodwa Dlamini a confident woman and qualities of leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Deals with the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The &quot;gogos zulú,&quot; as they are called in older women, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have until 14 orphans in office, offer them a roof where live and take care of children to come to school every day promptly and dressed in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who do not have anyone to remain under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 starving children, receives a salary of the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Furthermore,&quot; voices of Africa &quot;has set up a school of tailoring, has built two barns and, in collaboration with the American Health Organization PSI, has made many of the village&apos;s inhabitants have been subject to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not obvious, since, despite the apparent that this disease is all over the country, not usually speak openly about it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> A rarity in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his affluent lifestyle and full of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has made the HIV virus in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also due to the myriad seasonal who travel the country from one side to another, and they are where they are going. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz,&quot; in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Here is another culture, only accept the skin against skin contact.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To encourage cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, pugnacity, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still recall of the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white singing songs in a language of black; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and arrancarle very pleasing, but has also made a couple of tears to some rabioso border that another soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey leads them always Esitjeni, where the singers visiting children apadrinados. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In spite of the fact that this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is widely known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Acércate Esitjeni, there is the light,&quot; says local people. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after doing the 8.733 miles in a straight line back to Heidelberg street until the trial chambers Bergheimer full of singers dictate the step, you realise that it is also possible to see shine your light from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the ice has a thickness of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Nasa, the American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there are also water helada specialist, as emerged from three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is constantly in the shadow has been formed a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is presumably from comets or asteroids that collided at the time, most likely, against mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one blamed the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature in mercury can reach up to 426 degrees celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help explain how the water and other components of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> So completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, the probes, and small robots such as the Telescope, is dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time send images to earth: small windows to the immensity of space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a House developed by German researchers of the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Plutón neptune, which revolves around the sun just behind, according to the new definition of the term, published by the International astronomical union in 2006 Ceres is no &quot;planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; containing infinite generations of stars: the oldest stars are as blue points, although the most difficult to recognise is the colour pink of the stars &quot;baby.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of formation of stars, called in a little romantic by scientists W5, was spotted by the Telescope Spitzer Casiopea, at a distance of 500 light years away in the constellation. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Disappearing this tornasolada image of a star was taken by the NASA Telescope Spitzer. </seg>

<seg id="1813"> The combination of a normal photograph and a spectacular infrared image gives rise to a colourful. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This budding star behaviour was caught in all its glory for the first time by Telescope&apos;s infrared detectors Spitzer. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: how originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It is probably remains of one of the saturn lunas who disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the greatest and most clear-cut photographs taken by the Telescope Hubble: the galaxy&apos;s Eddy. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the tonalidades, some images of galaxies spirals become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image released by the European southern observatory shows the fog Trífida situated to thousands of light years away in the constellation of Sagitario. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Trífida comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three), as a dark lines of hot dust divide the heart of this area of star formation in three lóbulos. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers were photographed the signs of a cosmic carambola logged: 400 million light years from earth towards one another to finish the nuclei merging of two galaxies abalanzan clash so hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This formation of stars behaviour was caught by the Telescope Hubble in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Those who do not like to abbreviations techniques could refer to it with the nickname of southern Molinillo. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the Hubble space Telescope shows a section of the fog Iris in the constellation of Cefeo. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The fog situated 1.4 miles is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than that of the dust particles that can be found in a house. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created from images optical and x-ray examinations made by different Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a template for NASA&apos;s Hubble space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists call the spiral galaxy of larger UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this fog is the group of bright young stars of our milk route. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This area of stellar formation produces constantly new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, along with the shadowy Roseta, also constantly arise new star; 5,000 light years from earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole is still no dust, gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the big Bang, when the universe was found particularly hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window on the universe: the most important Telescope </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the Telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of the optical Telescope, has stopped growing and images that give us increasingly have depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Telescope Hale situated in the centre near San Diego pigeons was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA., closed the large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The Interior of the great canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the southern African large Telescope in South Africa is segmentado to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, has a diameter of approximately 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of this construction is more economical than the Telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has a fixed angle of elevation. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Their particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller, this ability is matched by that of the world&apos;s largest mirror Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of Arecibo radiotelescopio (puerto rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of life heading. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radiotelescopio has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;search for intelligence heading&quot; (SETI by its acronym in English) can help anyone who has a computer, providing processing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> View the European southern observatory (that) located in the chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here was the very large Telescope, a Telescope to live up to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors, this Telescope can also illuminate the spectrum infrarrojo medium. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The that also will host the so-called E-ELT (European extremely large Telescope or European extremely large Telescope). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflectantes elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Telescope Keck located in the Kea volcano hawaiano of Mauna were considered the world&apos;s largest. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Telescope Keck form part of the Kea observatory Mauna, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Telescope Subaru and IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> On Kea Mauna is planning to build a new Telescope mirror of enormous proportions and with a diameter of 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is a picture of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important information in the cosmos comes hand in hand with the Hubble space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990 sends images of distant galaxies. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space Telescope Kepler seeks planets extrasolares, mainly those that are livable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of his mission had been located 1.235 candidate planets. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the image are the final preparations prior to the launch of the space Telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb space Telescope Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The space Telescope&apos;s primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of this Telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Researchers from the basis that there are ice on the South pole of mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no hard evidence, as the probe Messenger revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades the radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbita on mercury, scientists now have the certainty that is so. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Daily drink butter and live 168 years </seg>

<seg id="1879"> South of azerbaijan can people reach age biblical. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> It even has a museum dedicated to longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search for fingerprints in a country in which people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as savage and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minibús moves with great commotion through the between road that passes the side of forest hills, rivers of wealth and the simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the black forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> However, we are in the southernmost area of azerbaijan; the border with Iran is just a few miles from here. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here are the &quot;talyshi&quot; well, a people that does not know much, apart from that dominate the persian and the azeri and are very longevos. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small town boasts a robust architecture perhaps too we have here designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit that into such a scenic mountainous landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The European tourists barely come to this place, because the road from the capital of azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> To go 323 kilometers from both city centres, eight hours are needed because the road is one-way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The astonishing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the caspian sea oil has not yet reached this recóndita region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May at the conclusion of the eurovision song contest and next year we will celebrate the festival of the world&apos;s most elderly people,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is the director of the Museum of longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> This is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis the place beyond the age of 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> His son died at the age of 136 </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no departure of birth that assurance. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite disturbing. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children. apparently still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Is wrong then şirali Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Rostock Institute, has also heard of the age of this inhabitant of central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also very old people live,&quot; Scholz says, &quot;even in sardinia, many older men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil register. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day full of butter derretida flasks </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people over the age of 100. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why do you live here in the south, many elderly? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The tourist guide azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The Director of the museum, mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that food rich in calories from the talyshi, who worship the meat, bread and milk products and many of whom, moreover, drink a glass of butter derretida daily, is so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or perhaps it is the natural way of life which keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small town not far from the town of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In its 97 years is relatively young for what is estila at these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden House typical of the entire caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting on the ground, moving unremittingly a huge tub of butter. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also brincan from one side to another two small children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea served in a typical flasks with abombada form. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and lurking beneath the headscarf two long dark hair that his son found us proud trenzas. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed leather with milk, so I have been dropped and never has maintained its colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used a shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Of has always eaten only what produced on its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In my life I have never gone to shopping at a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she speaks of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was the time after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> However, all returned to their feet when the &quot;dear father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This kind of propaganda sounds strange from an older woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> In azerbaijan, however, the cult professes to paternal figure of the nation, who runs the country as a dictator, knows no bounds. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He remained in power until 2003, when he gave up the baton to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least the elderly people of azerbaijan does not know what is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva claims 230 manat (roughly the same amount in euros) in the form of monthly pension, an amount that you can live well, considering the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;the elderly are very respected in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Living in a large family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if this were not reason enough to stay alive many years... </seg>
<seg id="1938"> In the Constitution lack the expression &apos;human rights&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Demonstrations vying with one another in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division currently facing the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future Constitution, with Sharia as the basis, it is very controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian President he gave in patetismo. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> &quot;We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; said on public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was aimed at all the people, especially the coptic christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and the secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them, inevitably plunged so far in a confusing opposition, they fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking forgiveness, has had to cancel on a temporary basis the powers of the constitutional court and extend theirs &quot;to save the Revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, neither the egyptians and the whole world knows full well what this engineer of 61 years with a phd awarded by the University of southern California really wants to save. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Depriving their power to the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval was prompted by a constituent Assembly consisting of 100 Members predominantly islamist in 15 hours a night, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, in the draft also says that the law is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> &quot;Principles&quot; however, what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the islamists will seize this vague wording, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that brings Forth, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> That at least is suggesting a new article added: in all issues relating to the Sharia is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country&apos;s largest Islamic institution with a great power in Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It need not be this way, but this may mean that the clergy should monitor the legislation, which - in fact - as a result the incapacitation of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> It is also a problem that aims to maintain the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts have put a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the dictator was until 11 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As set out in the draft, the state will protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that this article with the help of state institutions could even control the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Let me make it clear it is not a matter of anything other than censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> But that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead another prohibits offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, it is not clear what is an offence and how to be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits the &quot;affront to people &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a letrado? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for signing and according to his words,&quot; very soon &quot;will be presented to the egyptians to be put to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has become&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir square of Cario and swore themselves drive minutes before it can come into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and we will overcome,&quot; says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists for the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace and exdirector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft Constitution should be &quot;in the dustbin of History.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2006"> Make that there a week here. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Can then tell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the exquisiteces of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It snowed. The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, fleet in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is trout in salazón is making wine in water during stale, depending on how you prefer, up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As tinted and is doing more cold, they come in droves to a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, mesmerizing. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;Can be eaten raw and then drink a glass of aquavit of a pill,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen rakfisk, fireman of the city that is what is known as the &quot;general&quot;, which is in charge of organising the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> People eating this fish from all directions that is kept in small buckets and sipping from a pill significant quantities of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people like the aquavit rakfisk &apos;, says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The beverage can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Pruebo some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid pass near the nose, is not bad; it is not very different from a piece of sushi that has travelled a few miles by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty sweeping Norway and where, before cooling existed, the fish was during the autumn immersed in water and salt in barrels watertight. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in the winter, when enough is enough fermented, lifts and obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, can be eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, higher wages and a comprehensive system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until recently not too much richer than Norway, arrived in this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite stale, of Norway&apos;s past. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. A rod of beer or a sandwich you cost the tune of €10 ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians like that. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist acribilló shot and killed 77 people, among which included men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, they refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of 22 July.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2030"> Behind much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970&apos;s, one of the world&apos;s largest oil and gas industries. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we go as well,&quot; says Anna, our camarera, while passes bandejas rakfisk and that, with its long melena rubia and its striking blue eyes, is the image of the Norwegian welfare. </seg>

<seg id="2034"> &quot;We don&apos;t like to boast, we do not like the ostentation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As the whole world waste money that did not during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;While we ski in winter and making rambling in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; adds with a desenvuelta belly laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I just had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now a hamburguesa raise is certainly something different and quite suculento to savour. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But at night, becomes the stale fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I alojo is one of many in which is hosting a dinner of local rakfisk where the comensales vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tests the graves nasales. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> A live television has connected with a broadcaster that brings pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes. </seg>

<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here is our score, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from the chair, perhaps outplayed by aquavit. </seg>

<seg id="2050"> Mexico: henry Peña grandson faces a tough start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico&apos;s incoming President, Enrique Peña grandson, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, will Grant, looks at the challenges facing the new President and the different expectations of its people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, has been installed since Monday an Iron fence that short several main roads leading to the city and that is causing considerable chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim, however, was not stopping people could come to their place of work, but to prevent the demonstrators could come to Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña grandson, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against the narcotráfco that has already killed some 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; explained Mr Peña grandson earlier this week the US President, Barack Obama, in the Oval office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the President of the US, Mr Peña&apos;s previous political experience was as Governor of his home state, Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A populous state and a rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; the views on the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> An Honest Man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valley Bravo, for example, he recalls with affection. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr Peña grandson, which is a huge improvement compared with roads agrietadas and full of potholes that were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> One can also see plates with his name on the entry of a modern polideportivo and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We hope that he will make a real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr Peña grandson, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;Particularly in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Member Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of pine trees within the Party there are many expectations of henry Peña grandson. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The opposition also rejects the rating to lack of substance of the new President. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;It is a very honest, very committed and man with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a fantastic statesman and, above all, is a person who you listen to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> On the other side of the state, however, that is not the impression that many people on its former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast with the streets adoquinadas Valley Bravo could not be higher. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under sections of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the municipality&apos;s problems are too tough and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert area, located next to a rubbish dump, have been abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of women killed. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña grandson was the governor, a rate far higher than that of ciudad Juárez, unfortunately, famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr Peña grandson say, at best, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a house of concrete, typical of the blighted neighborhood, Irinea Buendía must make efforts to stem the tears while shows photographs of their deceased daughter, Mariana moon. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believes that her partner murdered. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I came home, it seemed as if he had cleared the body,&quot; recalls mrs Buendía. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;There were signs that had been hit and rigour mortis had already appeared.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother relata history, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross in which you read a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a alborotadora, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that you simply accept what they say and street.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that cannot be true when there have been so many irregularities and such negligence,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash that President Peña grandson will on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to make it a priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it will be the kind of President that was when I was Governor,&quot; the Member said the PRI Olvera in Valley Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But that is precisely what the families of the victims of city Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not reported mistreatment, according to state prosecutors </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to cope with complaints of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the period of Quantico Manning in the military prison in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to be immediately discard the case on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The army&apos;s soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce abuses now alleges that military suffered while he was in detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During interrogation that Manning in a hearing prior to the trial the prosecution made in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor commander Ashden Fein said that the records of weekly visits from officials of the unity that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted following the request from the defence of desestimara since his incarceration had been hard and that it had already seen enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Wikileaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In view of the Friday, Fein reviewed with officers Manning the forms rellenaban after visits to Quantico Manning during his detention at the military prison, where he was imprisoned in solitary maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers would have asked questions to Manning and noted their answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Friday Fein asked on the forms, Manning admitted that he had described the treatment they gave the celadores as &quot;excellent&quot; and treatment facilities in general as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not show any complaints of abuse, even though the official asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said he had expressed his concerns about certain issues and that the officers I visited had talked about these problems and I had to be treated, but indicated that they were not aware of these issues in the register. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;Wrote&quot; without consequences&apos; after having spoken of the problems - but that does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems, &quot;said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, army col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why it had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting which took place in January 2011 with a Council to explore the intentions of suicide that was expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the &quot;Prevention of injury&quot; scheme under which was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said it had put him under restrictive regime, which is a level below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their safety and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the staff knew that I was well and (wanted) to be under Prevention of injury... to be able to enjoy what is, in my view, a better quality of life,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located on the basis of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said that the fact that they are not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell only the camp Arafjon, to that cage,&quot; Manning explained on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought he was going to die in that cage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning said that once moved to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said he was only allowed to have a cushion, a blanket, a chancletas, some clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He explained that trying to move all the time, which was already prohibited sleep or even lying during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while slept. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if the celadores could not see him up when he gave a return at night, woken him for you to take the ride. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer submitted a formal complaint about the treatment he received in January 2011 Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that had made in Thursday&apos;s statement, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell one night Quantico forced him during a morning count to remain standing desdnudo before the celadores and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he was never given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said that dedujo by the order, which gave him the celador to slip the blanket with which could have covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to stop falling. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified on Thursday that she was forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that he had told the official that could have used the elastic of his underwear or their chanclas for autolesionarse but that it had not. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his underwear, their chanclas and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers have the hope that the judge will at least look at the experiences for which happened during his time in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted in the Council of war, which is due to begin early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense claimed that it intends to make Manning is guilty of minor offences and defend other allegations considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> It is expected that the hearing will resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held according to the rules apply to all detainee who is maximum custody in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, cause illegally publication of information on the Internet, leak of national defense information and theft of public property or records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is convicted of all charges, could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identity crisis mexicano-estadounidense </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to criticise those who were; he says that recall Mexicans in those difficult times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that the mexicano-estadounidenses are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had declined by the explanada handling of immigration and come to the area and was totally confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Some posters showing the way to two lines: one for &quot;Mexicans&quot; and another for &quot;foreigners.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there a few seconds without being sure where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Having grown up in central California, all my life I have called &quot;Mexican.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is about ethnic taquigrafía, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my italian friends in New York to call themselves&quot;. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided to &quot;mexicano-estadounidense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the country of my grandfather, the taquigrafía or the scripts were not needed. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> It was American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish. well enough and manejarme during an interview in that language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native American and I cannot get rid of my accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport, and I was in the queue of foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of this week in which Mexico&apos;s president-elect, Enrique Peña grandson, visited the White House to meet President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the day&apos;s agenda, as always to meet the leaders of those two countries, was: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Peña grandson was also keen to talk about growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons that at the moment is as likely to stay in Mexico as a Mexican who venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a trading bloc in the style of the European Union in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Furthermore, Peña grandson promised to continue to fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, but did not give details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably the majority of Americans will never remember that in 1848 America invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give half of its territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that you remember are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, in the time in which a United States official says anything that involves the slightest criticism to Mexico, if you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite Mexican, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Moctezuma are on a war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is quite a challenge we have with the more than 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> About grudge? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, las Vegas, Denver, San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was one person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, which was closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the time that person fitted in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of qualifications, from a poor people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their top-down and they are loyal. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> To Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexican belonging to the elite of the ruling class are not gustamos. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over the shoulder as if we were of a lower status that is not sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not been gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not now be trapped behind this silk screen, living in the United States but, yet, as a solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when he was a child, I am reminded that there is this roce between Mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know all the more forceful who they are and the seconds it bothers them. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel they are not part of either of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love to hear the Mexican group the tigers in the north, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States we are considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to complicate matters further, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot;ambassadors&quot; of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We say to our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with the inequality of wages, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you you will be alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some mexicano-estadounidenses are still very bitter about how his family was treated for much less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> We are perhaps more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, New Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and hamas could well be an unlikely basis for Peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will one day be a lasting peace between arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual useless and discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen Near Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s metropolis, and the Holy City of jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite the fact that the Israelis and palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has made everything shattered like it or not, palestinians and Israelis have been stuck in the regional uproar. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will make his fight even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that their deadly impasse could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither is lost or wins </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism is now very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if it keeps the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, the clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of hamas, the islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kicking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of their leaders and got pressure on Gaza&apos;s 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel could not deal with hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other side of palestine currently governed by their ruthless rival Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of hamas could come to the conclusion that the time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Since the islamists have gained influence across the Arab world, hamas has made rich and powerful friendships. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has also embraced the cause of hamas. did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic in the gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubilant the member of hamas say the Islamic crescent is persistently surrounding Israel from lebanon to the north, which dominates the partido-milicia hezbollah via syria, where islamist rebels from a growing tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to jordan, where hamas&apos;s allies are threatening to the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> On Israel&apos;s southern flank, the growth of the Muslim brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in egypt, by far the most populous Arab countries, and fundamental has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not too long to hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Muslim brotherhood are cousins Brothers of hamas and its leaders depend more on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic action, it is possible that hamas emerges as the player cannot be excluded, including Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, Israel&apos;s hardline wing will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> With regard to the military aspect, have put hamas in its place. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Israel&apos;s top Iron missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of the hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis dormirán happier... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that hollowed out West Bank, the main chunk of a territory contender to become state of palestine, and protects the jewish settlements that are still rising in spite of the fact that, under international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddling those clever palestinians giving them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If it really gobernaran in the West Bank, does not dispararían rockets as did their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them after that wall and give them a good blow if rose to head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps we impose a hard wing, although the Arab Spring could upset their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the islamists to take power in egypt and elsewhere not have much love for Israel, his priority will be tackling the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is higher than that of his four Arab neighbours together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> That the pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also the Israelis should think long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive the palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that blew up a bus in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state and demographics worsens the situation as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The harsh missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject hamas will pay a toll increasing diplomatic. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution remains the who preach sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire given a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which should start to curb the entry of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to persuade hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state that the imminent bid for a virtual statehood at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr Obama also has an important role when it comes to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Once in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The generic packaging of Tobacco law comes into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs of a muted green colour, which are the same for all the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian law on smoking and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and colours of the brands by wrapping a muted green olive, a horrific images of body parts with diseases and depictions of children and babies ill as children of smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the various images and mandatory health warnings, the only difference between packets, since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them small print on a type of source. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the world&apos;s stricter regime for Tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Australia&apos;s federal government says that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that it never will. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see that children, even from a very early age, understood the message that the Tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,&quot; said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not greatly affect the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The Tobacco companies said that the law would encourage Tobacco black market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Increase the amount of Tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra has, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for silicone pitilleras and covered to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had soared almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> She has said that Zico had sold Up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and that was awaiting further supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;For us it is good business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the target demographic sector as the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a number of Australian laws which prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sport and putting the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of Tobacco has gone through online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned Internet advertising companies and local websites, but cannot restrict it in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If comercializas Tobacco and you can only this brief window to promote your products, the most convincing in the online Space is the place to be,&quot; said Becky freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase in statements on brands from &quot;ordinary people&quot; published on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> I wonder if it is just a private citizen who really loves cigars Marlboro and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any company of marketing is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry is focused more on what the new rules mean that marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has even pay for ukraine, Honduras and the dominican Republic recusen the new rules; those countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the wto issued a resolution by the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on Tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images on packets. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Currently are compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Britain, new zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia many smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;The photographs do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply not case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Coges cigarro and guards the package,&quot; says Victor Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;Frankly, there is only one reason why would stop smoking: for my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of watertight king of the pack at the centre of Sydney, indicates that the packs uniform make it more difficult to bring them on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Normally tardaba an hour in desenvalar; now tardo four delivery,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have banned all Tobacco and then, as is, well, goodbye and shut the shop,&quot; says while lifted their hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly connected world, is not so bad aburrirse a little </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the holidays thanks to this year&apos;s day of action, so unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for it to another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had plenty of time to think about the Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend the day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is rather dull, even if you have the wherewithal to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to forget the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But there are more and more academics and experts in child development that praise the virtues of Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is right that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Aburrirse forces the brain to find interesting options and may encourage creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Given that, at present, the majority of us are connected to this or the screen, experienced the benefits of Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, should we accept in good mood Boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, as we will talk about that later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, Boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as Peter says Toohey Greek and Roman, professor of History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book &quot;Boredom: Lively History&quot; (&quot;Boredom, a Lively history&quot;) published in 2011 by Yale university press, is not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the history of Boredom is very extensive,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeya graffitis exist in Latin on the Boredom, dating from the first century a.d. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We must also consider how we define the Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the published research and raise the idea with a focus group composed of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined Boredom as the experience of &quot;hope, but we cannot participate in an activity that fills you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> He says that the difference between the Boredom and the apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Notes that with the apathy there is a desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of Boredom, he says, is &quot;the disruption of the care process, coupled with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The Boredom may sound terribly reminiscent of the depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are dreary tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem is with them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when what happens in reality is that we have problems concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;the Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person who was reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups were in the neighbouring room a television programme to all volume that bore no relation, others listened to the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group that had the programme with the volume low showed more boring than the other two groups; cost them focus, but were not sure why and attributed the Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;When you try concentrarte in a difficult task or interesting, the disruption of the attention can lead to Boredom,&quot; said mark J. Fenske, professor of the University of Neurociencia Guelph Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a line of manufacturing, a music you distract you can help not aburrirte.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;In fact, we know today that move or make garabatos, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of Boredom, may actually help to combat it, because it makes that person is physically more alert.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are being forced to stand still,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is aburrirse at some point: the delay of a plane, a dull speaker, a particularly boring film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are likely to aburrirse than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a &quot;level of trend to Boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale covers issues such as &quot;many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that by using these scales, researchers have found that children are likely to aburrirse more often than girls, and particularly need more external stimulation and more varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that was weary quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and Community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in contact with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Found that 32 per cent of teenagers said that aburría while in school or doing homework, while 23 per cent said that it was aburría when he was in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, the 3 per cent of parents said they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rates of Boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what we knew was that &quot;adolescence is a period in which the Boredom reaches its highest levels,&quot; in large part because both children and adolescents are not given a great control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my question of principle: is it good aburrirse? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, as absurd, taken to extremes, can push us to expose to physical risks, such as gambling or fall in the consumption of substances as a way to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between Boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;Boredom is the brain&apos;s way to tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and utilizas that energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, that you will. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you see the television, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;So, if your child is boring and give him an iPad, it is possible that it is no longer aburra, but there will be no less learned to entertain itself or to dosificarse,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this ability to dosificarse applies to other situations,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child not only less learns to entertain themselves, but are learning to be better in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to praise the Boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of the persistent rumour activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;In our view, we need more tiresome, but the Boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing to link it with something worthwhile,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Points out that what people really want is a way of blocking and enjoy a time-out. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados,&quot; says, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to turn our attention when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: no book of instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years in a community and footballer Institute student from Southeast Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to fumarla. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco says that a day of September, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and a later judicial Orozco was given a citation for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that carry a fine of 100 US dollars) each in which he reported on the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Treat us like criminals,&quot; says Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> And what are they? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalisation of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are canceling both here and in Washington State, where it passed a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have failed to bring charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, to be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors of more conservative districts in Colorado are committed to proceeding with open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent Opening shops in marijuana, approved recently, in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington also are dwelling on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And are still seeking advice for establishing a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all before the deadline, 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most of the States on the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with terapeúticos purposes and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, as well as a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the alcohol control committee in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr Smith admits that somewhere or system can only make suggestions about what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent that will serve as a model,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, leaving a year during which nadará between two stools, as the licensing system in this state still exists, but the acquisition will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Moreover, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, and how to maintain a balance between the state&apos;s obligation to provide a suitable &quot;access&quot; to the authorized marijuana and a ban on doing business of cannabis in a radio under 300 metres of schools, parks, play areas for children or day-care centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Nowhere is more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorised that in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group recently established. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates Aurora, the police chief, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which they reported that the prosecution of the city would cease to prosecute minor offences for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years of age and that the police would bring charges against these crimes &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said that they should be in charge of enforcing the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that would continue chasing drug smugglers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he assured that his office would pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, even though many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has a duty to bring legal proceedings against those mistakes that at the time that occurred were crime,&quot; Mr Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The answer was complicated, even in places like rural county of table, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in grand Junction, the largest city in the county, it quoted adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, County district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think that it is losing the time to continue enforcing the law until it changes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The contradictory reactions that occur around the state show a sharp ambivalence among officials about the large green experiment in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;This is a cultural barrier with the tax district,&quot; says sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants for possession of marijuana and is local spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent so much time pushing people before the courts that, in fact, still can&apos;t accept that is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states that consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases nationally on the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sale, also are looking forward to receiving information from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will subside. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the Federal Government has allowed mostly offering businesses for sale of marijuana for such purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;Although it is likely that the anti-drug agents not to pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will balk at the operation of shops regulated by the state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,&quot; said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor anti-drug policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and are likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which allow someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;Our Community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are looking for what the Community voted against a vote in favour of what the State voted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many questions about it. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I acosaron until echarme of Oxford as a Tory&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It attacks the University for their points of view not only now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming in securing a place at the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that drove the two pillars of civilisation: the free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, in the two weeks to take my place in the Worcester college in the late 1980s for the purpose of the race in history, had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and was in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were bemused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The evening standard newspaper said that I had left because they tolerated some colleagues from university maintained sexual relationships in the room next door. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I forced drinking rates desconchadas. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Huí there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, Huí, because she had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my flamboyant name, or the fact that came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I acosaron for one reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my Father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You may wonder what this is in now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering a similar prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The institutionalised and growing hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them have called for the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Member of the conservative JCR (grouping students in grade) of Corpus Christi college say they are &quot;often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirables&quot; for his political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a seat on the board of equal opportunities for its University College to make sure they can express their views freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called &quot;Wonderland: young, bright and on the right&quot; (paradise: young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of students and presenting the Tories as eccentrics and neo-nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Showed the Oxford university graduate student Joe Cooke, former head of the conservative party Association (OUCA), in a silver Rolls-Royce, looking a suit and a cane with the silver empuñadura. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Conservative in other universities, students say they are treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; for the introduction of higher tuition rates. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke black, 20 years and deputy chairman of the conservative party association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon club without even know.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi who tabled the motion for a better protection, says that this environment is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected President of OUCA, says that the attitude of the Member of the center-right JCR towards people who are worse. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the Members,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first weeks in Oxford was more alone than the one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I joined the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old man terribly timid. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the conservative party was at its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former pupil, an honorary title &quot;cause&quot; following cuts in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere had done shudder of horror to any stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first few days of the week to welcome the new university, when the new students are known and unknown to the professors, received a sign of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I found that the professors did not only turning a blind eye to the derision that was of the university conservative, but willingly participated in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The policy of the miners&apos; strike, privatisation and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa spilled into the Wood of the seminar rooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first I attended were translated into English French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;Please lead the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Di no. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a man bajito with a face that seemed mass of bizcocho, knew well how to oust bad bilis. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Do the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or, simply, is that they are stupid?&quot; asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other university rieron. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> My eyes were burning of tears trying to contain. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, provided that is not too busy knowing people,&quot; gruñó Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room and a soul in pity. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university; then I felt a mild slap on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a second year student of English called James that was presented as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; I said politely. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this is how will the thing. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> They pick on anyone who is suspected of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers seeming to be Labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at a local pub, I tried a cowardly manner disguise. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> Stressed that he did not agree with everything that mrs Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The trick was useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics that, paradoxically, had studied in Eton fascist, said: &quot;You are the product of a pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Are contaminated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took this cancioncilla. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How have sex the Tories?&quot; asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;There are a beating each other, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I was in the same way that should have been the liberal gay before the law in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I will end up having to be with people who think like me just after dusk? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Would to labour and repress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that I hoped posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history at my university college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the conservative party, but also of Thatcher in foreign policy adviser and one of the people he wrote his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Detestaba the place that they regarded as parochial and insignificant and his adherence to the marxista-determinista vision of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 accepted a post at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you will not be happy,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to go daily from Oxford to my parents house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan more open-minded. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he studied there in the 1940s, it accepted all the political points of view. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But if it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sadly. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;They never do that, not there between my dear dream needles. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Communist to my friends always had a faultless attitude.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> With their pain eyes began to nublarse. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Dale another chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that we have done just to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> Makes my heart partiría if dejaras.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stress was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the conservative party, had succumbed to the pressure and had resigned his creed. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had intimated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Red embarrassment inside, admití that my parents I had washed the brain &quot;and called them&quot; old &quot;stupid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted a short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> By the time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was inside acurrucada fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors desistieron. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they were made the suitcase and cogí the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I llaméis weak llorona. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no one of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 Prime Ministers of the conservative party but, to date, is hiding behind a nothing deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance to the fame&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> At the shows &quot;Valentino: master of the tailoring,&quot; which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous italian designer&apos;s clientas </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset house, a former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has said during the opening of &quot;Valentino: master of the tailoring,&quot; a retrospective apoteósica bringing together more than 130 high tailoring clothes created by its &quot;maison&quot; during the last 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Very dear &quot;me this palace,&quot; he says with his unmistakable italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This display is the pinnacle of a story whose sole player is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but that could not have been written without honourable clientas. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the poisoned and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and photos with the signing of the most granado aristocracy abound, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, via the Marie-Chantal of Greece and Princess Margarita of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: from humble Voghera fashion of the city, in northern Italy, the &quot;idol jet-set&quot; international. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Be lover of the royalty is not at all bad. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least not apagan colillas their pitillos on your wonderful carpet and make some beautiful celebrities of pop music,&quot; says lady Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino host is a spectacular and expensive enough with generosity and grace. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all encantaba be guests to his villa in Gstaad,&quot; explains the exmujer &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, intimate of neglected beauty spots such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And yet, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, looking a Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forgets the charisma of the fashion. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, went to dinner at his flat. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> There were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the apartment, layout, food, music, things looked and felt his spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;Each of the guests made us feel important and dear,&quot; recalls the &quot;top a&quot; high tailoring, which began working with him during the week of Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art,&quot; rounds off. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of alcurnia </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but loves well matched. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they will love it. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset house has been turned into a glamurosa gateway for 60 metres long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models may and must parade for the bridge to see a &quot;hearing&quot; dream that looks Valentino masterpieces such as clothing that chose Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes he used Monica Vitti in &quot;The Notte &apos;, or a wool coat and shoes that belonged to empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In an audience of maniquíes relucen names such as luxembourg Sibilla, Gloria von habsburg Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Bulgaria or sofia story. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the fashion, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clientas say that the first Valentino is like the first love,&quot; impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Name was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a chaleco gillette &quot;and a jacket of the collection otoño-invierno 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift that I did it,&quot; says Naty Abascal, &apos;one of the muses of&apos; designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer him over other for their femininity, for his great love for women, because enhances our beauty,&quot; added the former duchess of fair. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like very much the colours that uses, are very light and are &quot;donors&quot; in the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I was clothed Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> As a teenager and lived in Italy, dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to use one of his suits at night... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Eventually the time came in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first dress Valentino for use at a party at the House of my cousin, prince Edouard Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red suit, with skirt volados,&quot; corsage drapeado and escote word of honour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,&quot; explains this aristócrata italian who lives between Paris, New York and buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess d Arenberg keeps its clothes of fashion festival with &quot;the maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the whole of memories that entails.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the Marie-Chantal Miller bride in her wedding dress with Paul in Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as he calls the fashion to their costureras) to develop this colour ivory silk dress with incrustaciones pearls, twelve different types of relationship and a queue of four and a half metres. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes specialist, highest authority of the press, the dress is a milestone in the high end of the 20th century,&quot; the return of the clientas tailoring of high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obnubilado for years with the &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the elite, now Valentino is their best exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di great Croce senior (the distinction in Italy), Cavaliere Lavoro, Commandeur de l Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the legion of honour, Garavani accumulated so many honours as any of the spouses of their clientas. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;I have always been struck its refinement, calm, his appearance pulcro and perfect,&quot; admits d Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time that I saw was a month ago at a dinner gala at the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was on the table of the countess Jacqueline Ribes, a great friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was impeccable, the time is not for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it says a princess... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: the human seen Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> By four euros, the porteadores indonesian volcano risk their lives and health burden 70 kilos of sulphur from empinados Stone paths </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are those for which his work is a hell and another, literally, working in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> In the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> To that end, must come down every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidifica when they come into contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After clawing large rocks of sulphur, reaching a total despite a 70 kilos, carries in two baskets of bamboo that burden on their shoulders through escarpados Stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Are just 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which amounts to 2.386 feet, but the exhausted porteadores take over 40 minutes to amount to a snail&apos;s pace, observing the balance and measuring very cautious in their footsteps to resbalarse and not fall over the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any catch could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the Kawah riscos Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur mining </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once up, are appearing among the tourists that the circus fotografían as if they were monkeys, and charge fatigosamente the heavy canastas, walk three miles until the balance that a mining company has put a little lower, at 1.850 metres high. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is a question of PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating since 1960 the volcano and, rather, their employees, who never pays indonesian 662 rupees (5 EURO cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerillas, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whitewash the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As is normal load 70 kilos, produced a $46 rupees (3.8 euros) on every trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually make three portes daily. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Takes three hours to each one and just molido, but it may raise 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would gain in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The miners jornal is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is EUR two million rupees (167),&quot; clarifies the porteador, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the proportion was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for reasons of weight that is as strong as the sulphur: &quot;married to a young woman from Bali, Indonesia, where hindus, and I have brought on Java to turn to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tose constantly and it irritate the eyes by toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> In its 27 years, Anto brings three playing the skin in Kawah Ijen sulphur, which has already begun to pass Bill despite be covered his face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tose constantly and it irritate the eyes of toxic gases that fires the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price we must pay to achieve their dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; promises in an English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished for life, this young engaging and intelligent could be tourist guide, a hotel waiter or recepcionista, but instead is the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing an infamous wooden hut with other porteadores, every day to the two was closed in the morning because the sulphur is manar at night, when his characteristic colour yellow becomes blue and is in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shadows, Anto falls to alumbrándose crater with a small pocket torch affixed to its hull, which he has bought with money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porteadores loaded baskets of sulphur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanical engineering extracting the sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the porteadores, who work on their own and so much weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for house that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) of this natural park guards charged to tourists who come to photographed the volcano and logged its seen human. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals and not for the people,&quot; protest Madrusin, a fornido porteador of 42 years in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since he left school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, ensures that aguantará working &quot;everything it can&quot; because it needs the money to raise their three children, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eye when the wind changes suddenly and locks the miners in the thick columns that are out of the volcano, so hard that none complained of serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual artrosis, respiratory problems, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformado by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balanceando the basket on their backs, Unainik alone can load 50 kg of its 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his fellow grub 15 tonnes of sulphur the volcano, which three trucks move the warehouse of goats Tamansari, 18 miles away along a road between the undergrowth. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I don&apos;t jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life,&quot; proclaims Unainik opening his mouth, where it lacks several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of their five children, sulphur, 30 years, also works loading. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> As time passes, but poverty continues from generation to generation, one of the strongest of the world: the offices that make human seen Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore seeks babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blame the race, the stress and the cost of the property and education for not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband patriotic patriotic, you are my wife, do our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these lines are part of an announcement of menta tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as &quot;we will put a bao (roll) in the oven&quot; for laughing at the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The publicity firm that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement it will draw attention to the problem in a funny way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music for people to achieve their national duty.&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is a purely of the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with feromonas or organising evenings for quick quotes (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> It does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Spent $1,300 per year in policies to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for married and fathers gives up to $15,000 per child, extended parental leave and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a hi-tech, wealthy city-state in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its division of national population currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time I was in excess of 2 -conocida as reposición- rate was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> As Wei Ming, Director of the division&apos;s national population policies of marriage and the family, says that is due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;That allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of the soltería, and to delay marriage and children, which results in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy tip to drastically increase immigration to confront the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites rife with barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why that last year the Party Government of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and charges for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unintended consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the decline in the birth rate has known effects in a nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to so many homes are not built small. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;box of shoes,&quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These flats are areas of 46 square metres and sales have been very successful. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of soltería and discourage large Developers who want to build homes, family. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Developers buildings soon, ceo of the company, says that his &quot;boxes of shoes sold much faster than larger units.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted, days, even weeks, faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for Developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules may be a step towards a national increase in the birth rate, in talking to singaporeans who work in the city centre&apos;s apparently will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so that many people are postponing it,&quot; says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> People can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But it is important for me to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, singaporeans are those who have the final say. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The private off line is private on-line </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy is the quality of private or &quot;has the right to protect the privacy of any interference.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for a less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How does this definition in their daily lives and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Can you see the dangers that is exposed to ventilate online situations that surely would share out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Elperiódico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, asociaron the term &quot;something very mine, on a personal level,&quot; and &quot;in the name of the user and key,&quot; when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets might not to a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years, when trying to explain the significance of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and windows live Messenger, where it accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Secret &quot;are very secret, my mother can meet them, but not everyone,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In belgian francs subo images fine or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also entretengo with my known. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I would share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is being ridiculous,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, or write comments humiliating or violent crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures known to the 35 friends in belgian francs and their nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if I answered, I only the subo,&quot; adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Does not hesitate to say that would never accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Nor would do if someone that I recommend to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, in this latest admits not knowing 20 people aggregate in their list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has just been and asked the leadership of your home or your phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I simply pressure or you require the sack of my account,&quot; acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jose was follower of ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy did not fall outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> In a famous for my friend were extorsionando in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> It threatened and he demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;Never knew who he was,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, did not close the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;Only placed privacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a number of steps to shape the Bill safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> In contrast to George, this boy might photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> It would, if you fall ill or you get anxious. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know that this is ciberbullying,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos batons, teacher of English and with a degree in education and learning, believes that to guide to children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networks is reporting. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet emerged as a means to find information, but with the aparecimiento sites changed the rules of the game,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, masters in education at Yale University and author of the book digital natives and immigrants, coined the terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, while we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that the issue is complex,&quot; because we are asking that they have a definite attitude about what is or not endorsing, publishing or say to an age that the maturity does not for that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;Also to be selective when what matters most is popular, having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences,&quot; adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Say it does not serve,&quot; adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, batons lists some options: there are things that would not contarías to a strange, why you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, do you like to publish a picture of you as a friend publicaste? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on it? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When photos of party labels, pediste permission from the others to parcel them off? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more, all they need to know what you are doing every time? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is signalling that on-line must act as they do off line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One out of Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as must be on social networks,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo guard, university professor, professor of primary and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> To understand each of the relative they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is permitted to share or publishing,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to guard, is key to remind the children the lessons of &quot;no hables with strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The Sixth Summit of the presidential Suramericana Union nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without it being made public the declaration of Lima, announced previously and allegedly signed by the seven leaders in attendance. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efd tried repeatedly to access the document signed in the sixth ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of chancellery and presidency emphasised at the outset that he was given after the closure, but later said that at some point will be published on the web of the peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> To be consulted by the text, signaled that the content had been made by Peru&apos;s President, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information from the summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only delivered, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential House with the message &apos;private session, audio restricted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among the reporters was delivered by press spokesmen for some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document circulated during the day was the list of presidents assistants, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for greater data. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document which closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of Arab Sur-Países America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being repeatedly required by the press, nor spread the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international meetings, the peruvian authorities have worked with it insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited the maximum obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the hague that dirima diferendo border between the two countries. </seg>

<seg id="2717"> &quot;We shall abide by and ejecutaremos the ruling that defines the differences that today we are pushing this international court,&quot; Humala said, along with his chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the Treaties and international courts,&quot; added Piñera, and welcomed with a shake of hands to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that will be submitted to the icj happened next to Colombia this week denounced the pact of Bogotá who had agreed to submit to the judgments of the international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held with the presidents of Brazil, Dilma inasistencias Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, Bolivia and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay suspended Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President, Ollanta Humala, was commissioned to open discussions in the morning and close the Lima Summit, shortly after noon. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The Minister read the final document in which reported that took 16 agreements and set the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements mentioned that the Unasur countries will &quot;important steps toward the goal of American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis,&quot; the economic consolidation (in Latin America) do not have a parent triunfalista but must serve to extend nustra parent productive and look forward to a better future for our peoples,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... joining our countries and generating new economic channels,&quot; said the peruvian President in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, said that five correspond to Peru, and estan located in the cross-cutting themes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but did not give further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Moreover, the final document said the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country will rejoining the South American Union of nations,&quot; of which is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need to keep Latin America as a region of peace and prosperity, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this respect, the colombian president, Juan Manuel santos, said before starting its participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to discuss in respectful manner the maritime diferendo following a failure of the icj, questioned by bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these roads, are not mutually exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he emphasized. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;With President Ortega hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would be Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the taking of command of that country&apos;s new President, Enrique Peña grandson. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, as part of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers met prior to approve the plan of action in 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay of Unasur, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency pro témpore of regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &apos;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target in the south, in this case &quot;yes, Europe should learn from.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state-run TV Peru that Europeans &quot;was killed in the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are virtually a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Defended, in that sense, the project of establishing citizenship Suramericana who encourage the Member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers by any country suramericano reactionary, as already happens with members of the andean community, but there are still areas we want to return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The ecuadorean President was, moreover, in favour of the rearrangement of the Organisation of American States (oas) under the premise of reducing the influence of the anglo-saxon and take account of states that have signed the pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who give academic never commit to anything and, in return, we signed the South America everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the inter-american Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States,&quot; said in reference to the political asylum by Ecuador gave to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that is not repentant of that decision because it has not betrayed their principles, but that he respected their &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Adding that, at the time,&quot; had a well-founded suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and does not respect the process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He, also, to the Swedish Justice to demand that is put on their territory to interrogation by an alleged sex crime when &quot;the Swedish legislation itself can deliver via video conference, that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk of unravelling the physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ecuadorian Ambassador lung told me I had a small problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the chief executive. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> So there is a danger that deteriorate their physical and mental health for being locked in a small area without power do exercises in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This complicates the health of any person,&quot; added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange at the ecuadorian embassy in London since June, providing a salvaconducto to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, that word doesn&apos;t use in this case, but there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European institutions,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And ruled that &quot;if Britain gives tomorrow the laissez-passer that is running out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as well as allows its legislation and as he has done in other cases, interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or questions via Skype tomorrow is just this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and matizó that it does not tolerate is &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and the lie, which weaken the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil, evil politicians but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Here was pleased that are no longer these journalists&apos; bankers or the bourgeois hegemon and countries that dominate in Ecuador,&quot; and brought forward to be re-elected &quot;deepen in the revolution to continue along the path and the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, to argue that the agency &quot;must be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the law&quot; because in reality &quot;golpismo been shattered the legitimacy of democracy paraguaya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The ecuadorian President also found &quot;very pertinent&quot; the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel santos, the maritime limits between both countries to negotiate now with Nicaragua after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the hague, which benefited nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment, there is no toes that ruling. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and one Central American. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We need to prosecute them in a broad sense to overcome them and move on. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Also entrusted to a good conclusion of litigation by maritime limits between Peru and Chile in the same court and ruled that &quot;is right for Latin America seeking international bodies if the two countries agree to accept failure by painful it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the event to be presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said she sees that possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if it loses the elections of February of 2013 will be removed from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level I was never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socio-economic in Ecuador that poverty can only be corrected from political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My movement pólitico believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that reponsabilidad,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> To win would be my last period in the presidency and hence out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose together. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS are now due to late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the positive outcome of the test: Aids. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if I was a bomb,&quot; referring to recalling the time of the announcement, which the doctor would do &quot;more suavecito, without clear success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Decided to take over just about his illness and began to learn about it; with such determination that already festejó his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990&apos;s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, to the director of a clinic&apos;s IMSS avoided bid him farewell &quot;because brought a cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of his illness, yet many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc,&quot; exhausted &quot;his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, not the least of reported the first cases,&quot; the great achievement means at this time that a patient&apos;s sobrevida starting treatment in a timely fashion and sobrevida among the general population, it is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the unit&apos;s HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was supported in April this year in a scientific journal prestigiada. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectólogo and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a judgment fatal, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affecting the immune system of the patient before the diagnosis, better expectation for people who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when bring 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple terms, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;while maintaining control can live without problems until the age of 75,&quot; explained the interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For dimensionar this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS declined 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (unaids annual report), it is also true that from the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May of this year, but will ensure that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - it seems to me that the problem is not of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So visualizo, that has happened to us in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have not had desabasto of the drug problem is that patients are very advanced because unknown state of infection, in late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Took a stunning fact: &quot;nine out of ten patients arrive when already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, early diagnosis is made more and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who require it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its motion are specialists and prevention of AIDS in Jalisco State Council officials (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to take the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because I had done a friend and, despite their young age, was in a stage of AIDS and even experienced sarcoma Kaposi, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that is going to die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am going to die, better reviento three times a week,&quot; say not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, I feed well, I exercise, I take the medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, as anyone. </seg>

<seg id="2811"> To take the test, if had risk, that between quickly know whether they are HIV positive, it is better and if they have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible. </seg>

<seg id="2814"> Big are the gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, argued Ricardo Salazar, journalist tapatío who has assumed the cause on the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the largest is in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> At the sites dedicated to this task &quot;has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us packages of 100, and that is all very well but some still do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> New infections are among the most vulnerable adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you want?&quot; is a common question, ironically and guiding value judgments of social workers, schools, employees of pharmacies and health staff, who did not want to expose the teenagers, assured the communicator. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Proposed redirecting this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in despachadores public baths of sites that go to young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> Is not motivate the promiscuity. </seg>

<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a US court of appeals a ruling that ignores the successful restructuring of the group&apos;s debt Vitro via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a harmful precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, then, that the procedures in support of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and the stripes, out of step with international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practical terms, the boost to the ruling issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, Mexican firms left defenceless against the possibility of seizure of their property in beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> For a start, while the judge in the case says that creditors should be governed by the law of bankruptcies in the United States, the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, based in new Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial contest through Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would ignore the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies with profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, towards that end was created the United Nations model law for the uniformity of international trade law, appear as referee the American law Institute. </seg>

<seg id="2836"> However, the possibility the recognised the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the in Vitro was not the first case in which it accepts the scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex Mexican and commercial, whose debts inter-company supported the Federal Institute for favour commercial contracts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> The truth, however, is that making the votes of subsidiaries, however Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, the funds &quot;buitre&quot; as Aurelios capital, Aurelios convergence, Elliot international and Liverpool limited, will not have achieved majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45% against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The fact it omits the Court of appeals. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another angle, it blames Vitro&apos;s difficult situation that faced from 2008 to soslayo of the grave economic crisis that confronted us, pegándole coletazos the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For one, the signature of the gonzalez family Sada stand an appeal for reconsideration in the court of appeals for the vote to go into full of it, namely the five justices, given that only three votes. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> Not to prosper it will require the use of Cerciorare requiring the review process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The serious case is that the Court sidestepped a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the concept of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;), in which he details the procedure followed by ivf commercial contracts within the framework of the law, pointing out that it desahogó with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to empatar this in Chapter 15 of the law of bankruptcies in the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2962"> This semester, when religion Professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;long final countdown&quot; the mayan calendar, on 21 December, which many people have been held as proof that it is the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Charmé had no idea what I expected in the next couple of months: the cataclísmico hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called &quot;deudarmagedón&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time they will begin the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I realised that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been,&quot; said Charmé this week to students of the university Rutgers-Camden (new Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not only a teacher who offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In nerve, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is running the course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We look at why these ideas spread over time,&quot; he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, may ignite a war. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and exploraron how compared with examples of real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,&quot; said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari attached, a professor of art history and results, have made team to provide only a course, entitled &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Not add &apos;2012&apos; to always have the option to teach the course again, if the world does not end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent ruin,&quot; Students should study, generating projects and take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In Penn state, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, which leaves students with no option but to work &quot;until the evening in which it is assumed that the world ends,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It saturó in two hours,&quot; said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We received e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people who asked if there was still held. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves to themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in religion and sociology of 23 years Haddonfield, new Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is just a matter of comfort or the lack of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student of the career of psychology and nursing, for 25 years, said they had seen all the apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;Had never heard of a class that could teach that,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But no student interviewed - and far less a teacher - said to believe the sell-by date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project was on the mayan prophecy and in some ways desacreditamos,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student last year in nerve, and in West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But acotó that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a boom in such speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;Otherwise people don&apos;t think about this,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In mostly in the english-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the university the Salle providing courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about some progress on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, suggesting an exception from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December,&quot; people will start to think immediately in the next date &quot;or to philosophise on 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which will end the world. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said they think go to Christmas &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe to call some friends to riamos us together,&quot; commented Samira Ford, student communications for 20 years. </seg>
