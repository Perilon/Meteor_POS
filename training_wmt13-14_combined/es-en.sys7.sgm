<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and asserts that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die as a result of the crash of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Indeed, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: The new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in that same line a majority of American governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that made the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, who saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, for the year 2011, introduced 180 projects of law that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a test of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter in the day of counting and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The State of Indiana was the first to claim it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For this reason, the Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years, these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification document. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American people do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American people, that is to say, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification document issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than $100. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In effect, a 25% of African-Americans, a 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years old and a 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have an identity document with photography. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there is still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students in many states, electors to vote for Democratic candidates, may not use the photo identification document issued by his institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Moreover, these states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who tend to vote Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 any state demanded proof of citizenship in order to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to present this requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures seek, clearly, limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It seems that two of every three Hispanic voters support the Democrat party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported certain laws in 2011 that abol√≠an the registration of voters on the same day of the ballot in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limiting the right of individuals and groups to create a service of aid to the voters who wanted to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the 2004 general election, voters registration campaigns contributed to the record of about 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters to fall in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, a 33% of the electorate that voted for in advance were African Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of Hispanics did exactly the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represent no more than 11 per cent of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, who represent a 76% of the electorate, they do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been fervently opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was, in part, limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, it is clear that they are intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in the key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: The new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of prostate cancer: Does Getting the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test presents, in some cases, wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decided to carry out medical interventions useless. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a more than enough reason to doubt the men, already reluctant by itself, whether or not they should be screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Does Getting the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked for advice to two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among groups of shows, for which it is difficult to interpret such data and make recommendations firm. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of suffering from metastasis if there has been a test of detection. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> American men have a higher risk index. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are nonchalant. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. It must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not violate the long-term life, in which case you should opt for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, given that the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, they suggest an active surveillance of the disease, and if it progresses, we offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> We determine increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should be treated or not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend that you do the test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not the test must be done. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevent disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is not a miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of investigations, the adoption of healthy habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We believe that if everybody ate well and moved enough, it could prevent a 30 per cent of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no smoke, that rate would rise by at least 50%,&quot; stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead, we evaluate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others remain totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Tobacco is linked with 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Greatly harm the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer was reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommended limiting the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, they climb the risk of suffering a colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Meat products should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;Can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between the vitamins and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> For the moment, however, their research is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Structure &amp; Terms of Transaction Under the SCC, studies about the vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While in one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what we observed was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to determine with clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Do the screening test does not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs bos√≥n in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bos√≥n generated a shock last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed, in effect, that this bos√≥n is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, it is the predicted particle whose existence the standard model: Our best, or &quot;less bad&quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists is not entirely clear whether Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without any doubt that there is a new particle that looks a lot like the Higgs bos√≥n predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week in an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyway, we assume that Higgs is, as the chances of making mistakes seem to be few. We&apos;ll see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a widespread and inescapable law that involves two things that can&apos;t be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way of violating that rule and not try too much, because it will end up getting hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although the particle physics is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these characteristics: The principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;state&quot; that consists basically of some of its features. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists classify particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand, we are faced with the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of St. Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And on the other are the bosons, a bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, incidentally, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: Those countertops, not discuss here, and the &quot;force particles,&quot; for which the major forces of nature is spreading and with which the Higgs bos√≥n would somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, we would stress here, are not the exotic creatures that we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Indeed, if it is able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bos√≥n: The photon, or particle of light &quot;that acts as a&quot; messenger &quot;of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge speeds or change of direction, &quot;mess up&quot; the electromagnetic field at that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;disorder&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this is another thing that a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons &quot;bearers of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable ground </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs bos√≥n, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be &quot;messed up&quot; for this bos√≥n appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needed to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This requires a huge particle accelerator as the CERN (the Large Hadron is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will never be maintained by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And, in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what &quot;can bring&quot; all these investigations?, asks the Lady Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, moreover, that physicists escrutinen differences between the observations and predictions of the MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For their part, many fervently want to be found, because the slightest difference could open the door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that tape certain holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, as not proposing any explanation regarding the seriousness (!), or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the Universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we have not found such differences in the CERN until the moment. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Implications </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of these investigations in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories in no way suspected the revolution that its work force. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreve√≠an scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, as has already said the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the lab Bell, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which produced the first continuous laser (the first down) in 1962, at the beginning of the laser was rather considered a &quot;laboratory apparatus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications can also come from across the surrounding instrumentation to research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Despite the fact that it was not at all its original intent, this probe now serves as &quot;eye&quot; for all the world&apos;s digital devices, which earned him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In his Commission Dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should soon return while preparing a draft law. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Now, within that domain essential, there is still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to watch closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Mont√©r√©gie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer that was destroyed had given him a reprieve of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I had been given five years of life, but now I have seven,&quot; recounts, made a pass, lying in his bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, which came the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this,&quot; continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has wreaked havoc: A huge weakness that prevents him to go to the bathroom and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, accepts resigned themselves to help him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, even to smile, to talk to strangers to devote attention to bring medicines and offer you a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found to remedy this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man does,&quot; he tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Returning to his childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the ability of a person to accept this regression,&quot; notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to the opinion of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients entering the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In that state, the team of doctors and nurses that surround them no longer offer &quot;curative care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of Mrs A., 89 years, is dying &quot;conscious and drowned out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made him to discover their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have some good children,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer have more desire in this life,&quot; he says, before accepting that you place a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And, expected in the next few days, a last visit to his son, who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They are palliative care that give them when you can&apos;t do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help his death to be more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> We in Quebec with a bed of palliative care for every 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little, because we all know that some day we will end up dying. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> He was dying to offer mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics are no longer controls them their rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son was finished beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; he tells Nathalie Savard, director of the care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the centre Victor-Gadbois days pass without ever be equal. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Beside a 94-year-old man who savor their last meeting in the courtyard, well-placed among their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old girl dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Six months ago, there are always three-to-five beds occupied by people under 45 years sick with cancer,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his house and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care facility. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the center Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great relative deficiency in the health care of Quebec what makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard, goes to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health care system of Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Recently,&quot; recounts, &quot;I have seen a patient to spend 14 days in Bamako suffering great pain without has done what is necessary to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die alone because they do not receive adequate care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hope of survival of H√©l√®ne Richard were already low when it left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;When I told my onc√≥loga that he wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that it was a pity that I would like to fight,&quot; recounts. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients seeking to die are grateful for their caregivers who have not served in their demands once they have been relieved their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that the palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care at home in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to the treatment against the pain in an 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the disease is not relieved will have the opportunity to have that palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want euthanasia,&quot; but &quot;I want alleviation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report has been possible thanks to a grant of journalism research institutes of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals of great breadth in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, collectors of funds from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia, day after day, to what they know of a formidable &quot;system,&quot; which are part of the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that went too expensive to the taxpayers Quebecers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious how the system is sprayed once we got to the media,&quot; satirises Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, the Liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had not consented to delay. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report &quot;Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved billions of dollars in contracts,&quot; containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part. </seg>

<seg id="221"> The ongoing anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to his team of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit operates in addition to the police &quot;Marteau practices,&quot; which, since 2009, have made the &quot;cartel of the sewer&quot; of Montreal moderate at the time of inflating contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> These past few weeks, the unit has proceeded to register in a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town on the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec City. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected that has been repeated pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> It has been formally charged to engineers of the road network of Montreal and employers of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and furthermore, Lino. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused shock to the committee to explain the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid for three years a 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia which transferred the money to Montreal, the party of the Mayor G√©rald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Furthermore, distributed money to right and centre during the years 2000, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> She also admitted having organized a collection of illegal funds for the liberal ex-deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Inflation in the cost of contracts for sewage </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it well before the committee: In ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all in exchange of contracts for sewage whose inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% of false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin M. Tremblay Dumont, accused of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal policies that made it sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the district of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, since 2010 objected to the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to promoters in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> The 70% of the money from the electoral campaigns was dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation that eventually will be carried out, she says that &quot;strip of a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> He added that the process is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices will not be repeated. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that &quot;the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is anxious about the role of the &apos;&quot;elected politicians abreast of the ploy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, sceptical: &quot;I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of the reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government Tsao Award proposes limiting to $100 donations to political parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;while they are not strictly restricted election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> Advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: &quot;We cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid basis, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites derision to look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season has acquired a new entity with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How to explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Could be explained by a decision of individual conscience, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Big players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Day by day at his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also has brought me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And those elements I push to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a party that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="261"> -on my way and Clairefontaine mine Etienne beginnings, we INF in the course always that have heart progressed-@-@ within preformaci√≥n leaps </seg>
<seg id="262"> It is going to get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits this summer are accustomed to play games of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That makes a player as I would like to fight and give it all. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is backed up by deputies as Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man that the team needed? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no one in the League 1 and is among the top European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence they have in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyon has taken the position of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarter-final with style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against Porto to qualify for the quarter-finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG can become a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Economically, the PSG is delivered to their means for this project. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we are going to invest all our efforts to take the title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season did not get far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May we were a disappointment, because we had the optimum conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We ended up with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, had a better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I think it will be a good thing. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe that we have the weapons for llev√°rnoslo. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect more of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We have fully accepted. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find themselves with things that criticise is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what most people expected. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 every week-end. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to put in place a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Talk to Manchester City that, after two seasons, he has not managed to qualify for quarter-final, and they also have invested a lot! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums spent, os imaginar√≠amos with 15 points to the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, they have been &quot;driven&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This demonstrates that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we can say in May with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has come to prove that it is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And it has shown in all the teams for which has been that it is a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The group in respect to the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men around. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> That pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you lived the EURO 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was very excited to participate in this tournament. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate play time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I was strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today achievement to play good matches in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I expected from my baptism with the &quot;blue.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you view of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the &quot;blue&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are well positioned in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved its goal of mechanics for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The draw (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the bases? </seg>
<seg id="346"> That game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the shock in Spain, had not experienced a similar game in my whole career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based in the central banks, identified transactions and the burdens of processing between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc., and a protocol of change to the way of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files of equals. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on a network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And nearly a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The contribution of the bitcoin, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (censan contributions in the page bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> There is nothing impressive if you compare it with the global changes in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) are interested in him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He described the bitcoin as a &quot;virtual currency with more success,&quot; &quot;that competes with the dollar or the euro,&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits,&quot; used to move forward in a video game and that you can win by playing, or you can buy (and even sometimes redeem). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But a central authority in any exchange controls, and discusses the changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With bitcoin, all the network nodes are repositories of books of accounts, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of encryption key double. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins entered in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write the new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that extra line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is a phase of cubed file, i.e., a large file in a shorter numerical footprint and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number of &quot;chop up&quot; the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once it is that number, the other nodes easily verified that is a good thing. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other is left an orphan, since both have different tracks. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the cienmillon√©simo, which leaves a large margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also reveals in every increase the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The ruling does not affect the same protocol,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The weight of actors like Wikipedia reject such payments. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the platform Wordpress, accept. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November it launched the &quot;giant rebates.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> Coinabul &apos;, for the by changed their turns 30.000 the Dollars bitcoins) at work Holmquist, Jon and money rejoiced over,. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of a book on that currency, believes in the potential of this technology into the network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or to a mobile payment without contact, but Bitcoin used to validate the transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to put in place in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough to provide a direction that a phone to &quot;photograph and recognize&quot; says Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take a while for Bitcoin will prevail, but in 2013 could be a change,&quot; predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Moreover, in its report, the ECB expected revalue various risks, now considered high, in the event that this successful currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What happens next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should leave at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and the Afghans to choose their own future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished primarily to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and former leaders refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign military, as in Soviet times. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their cases to join the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer when Westerners become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the hills of almond trees planted thanks to French credits, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by the helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since his irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then vacuum and the country wrapped in blood and fire because of the fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of his peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators, taking with government land for resale as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a couple of huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Discredited; most of them do not have fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, and also will be those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: The flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and their ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul has now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> We will have to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile telephones, television and their Turkish chapbooks that present a modern world has great admirers around the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now. </seg>
<seg id="429"> What is considered legitimate authorities who want to run the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is already concerned to reconstitute the provincial militias, who flee the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations, however, the US have wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want the foreign control, in particular because of elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has restored its services, there has been no fixed dam and irrigation systems have been repaired important. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported and does not produce anything except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumor that Afghanistan mining possessed immense wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that he did not do more to increase the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to extract the minerals iron or copper terrain and without means of transportation for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already have abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excaven the immense site b√∫dico and remain there as the major employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that depend on imports and exports, restore their normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The French troops departed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girls&apos; schools, colleges of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military fields, legal, health and agricultural and support to the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, with the aim of trying to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and make the impossible task of making the aid and the offensive actions match, a service of &quot;civilian and military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, and he did bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Such jobs, local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurgency, irrigation, drinking water wells, reforestation, fruit trees, sunscreen and increase of surfaces. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of local, very tough in these valleys situated often over 2,000 meters of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> For release of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, would be required to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and they come directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution with forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new double-or-nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly vote their final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Only a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to the Assembly to finish their work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has not done more to increase the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the president is persisting in its &quot;autocratic delirium&quot; and continues &quot;betraying its word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the part of his supporters, it ensures that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days should organize a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to relinquish its project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Or vote my text or maintain the full powers,&quot; powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist mostly, the text voted yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The majority of the liberals did not go to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because it felt that they could not enforce their points of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights, religious minorities and the civil society did the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, members, replacements in a hurry. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> As expected, the items have been voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been virtually expressed at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to believe that the clock of the Constituent was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Article 2, all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 constitution, which stipulated that &quot;the principles of sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that it could replace the &quot;principles&quot; for &quot;the rules,&quot; which would have enabled a stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, that this article has been modified is a guarantee of its good will and its respect for the other components of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Liberals accused of hypocrisy and consider that it is nothing more than a publicity ploy. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other items. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Relate, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is troubling because &quot;people called to rule is not elected, and it has no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Here we see the premises of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> Fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next chancellor of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one. </seg>

<seg id="484"> With this Constitution are in the framework of the marital status. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system, &quot;says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>

<seg id="488"> And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civilian judges to rule on top of all this. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond their religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that relate to the extended powers that gives the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were during the previous regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another sticking point: The powers granted to the military. </seg>
<seg id="492"> According to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Nor will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as demanded associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> These also showed their concerns relating to the text, which they consider liberticidal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially in the press. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The big and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While Members and human rights advocates argue about the consequences that the law would bring about the mandatory review, have already appeared in the country scammers that trade with certificates &quot;false&quot; </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> His only goal is to earn money to help their families have been left at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December enters into force a law, according to which each immigrant labour must carry out an examination to test their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule is applicable only to those who have the intention of working in the sector of the provision of services, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and to renew the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Exceptions are the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Will not be subject to this law people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Utility, doom and defense of the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of centres examiners work sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants can be submitted to the evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 centres of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But the defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, they often do this question to the press: And what will bring this into reality? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will bring the obligation of the knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;slave labour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people talk today about the defense of the rights of immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Federal Immigration Service&apos;s representation of Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defense of their rights should start before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organised selection will solve the problem of migrant workers in a 90% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems are immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, you get a &quot;my paid&quot; a shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;In his homeland promise them a thing, but when you get are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, not pay them the promised salaries,&quot; confirms the head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labor immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Don&apos;t be angry, jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, while many citizens in the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not your fault, but his own misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford the luxury of receiving normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is due to the fact that their families even do not have anything to eat the children, not to mention dress them up, calzarlos and buy what they need for school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> When you reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they acknowledge. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, when it comes to the law on the tongue, the defenders of the rights indicate an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If you do not have that status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living illegally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome or prohibited the step to strangers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The case is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be done quickly and for only thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and the cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &apos;Reporters for the said we like it the heart, &quot;asking a tea and cent-or Tadjikistan hundred it ruble Umed for Hushkadamov </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;We are going, don&apos;t be stingy, buy a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> On the first day of the entry into force of the law on the tongue, it became clear that not only registration documents for immigrants may be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;false&quot; certificates of knowledge of the language has already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The forged documents had been printed in standard color printers. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners, not as a gift: Each immigrant, who wanted facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to safeguard the system against corruption to the &quot;qualifications&quot; will not be able to buy, government officials and human rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities can promise to immigrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the examination of the first ever more time to study the basic course of the language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with the people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with guns registered is quite limited </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to owners of civil-use weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the government&apos;s reaction to the recent shooting incidents: Tighten during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre started by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogr√°dov, in which seven people lost their lives. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police wants to ban the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry arms, 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the head of the committee of the State Duma in terms of security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised to reform the law on weapons possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot;hardline policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of handles, demand that it abandon such measures as &quot;meaningless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of weapons registered is minimal, said to the BBC news service from Russia, the lawyer criminal Vasiliy L√©snikov. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of a firearm in organs of the Interior, compared with a total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that a more stringent legislation in the field of civil-use weapons will not be an inconvenience for the offender is targeted to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, according to his words in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Interior says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From factories to official </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapons supplies through various channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who for 10 years worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screen capture of the website that accepts orders of weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first, &quot;vestige of the military or army,&quot; i.e., weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians,&quot; says Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The next type of &quot;black&quot; weapon, the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that here include weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the organs of compliance with the law. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal weapons go on sale from the military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military arsenals often had explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There are versions demonstrated that some fires were caused deliberately to cover,&quot; says a exmilitar. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put their grain of sand. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under a rope to the black market, including Moscow,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One more source of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There are equipped with its own production, at times, and has formed a mafia that has organized the flow of arms,&quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where are the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of problems and planning of governance. </seg>
<seg id="671"> &apos;s in evidence well criminological Bibliography RosStat and the Interior in the professionals accessible reviews general public Department reports weapon the subject matter revolves around websites of their </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons of the black market has arrived there &quot;because of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; it says in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases, steals during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the &quot;illegal archaeology.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="675"> The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal diggers not buy one for a long time because they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he says, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Through some, the supplier purchases a unit, for example, a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Remove the registration and go over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;This is the weapon to the city and sold to 900 euros per unit with two chargers,&quot; tells us </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;But, of course, the police is aware of all the issues, so regularly, when you have to comply with the plan of discovery of offences, shopping test to traders of illegal weapons,&quot; adds the clerk. </seg>

<seg id="685"> Military commentator Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="686"> &quot;To get a gun need a friend who has contacts,&quot; says the clerk of the shop. &quot;I have a friend, but not much confidence in him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="687"> In the markets there vendors, but there also has to be, say, &quot;on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked that he said that he had fallen a tooth to her daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> I can even get a pair of brass knuckles steel through a person of trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He also supplied only to me because he knows that you are not going to inform. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The rookies are looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Schemes, according to his words, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Gave him a photo album where there was no &quot;of everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, do not offer a poke: Everything that there can be proven. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we are going with the seller to the forest, where we have a white. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I can assure you that the weapon fired well, we began to negotiate,&quot; describes the procedure the expert. </seg>

<seg id="708"> Military commentator and exmilitar Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have heard of these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People make orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer paid through an ATM. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, he sent a photo and instructions to know where he is hiding the weapon,&quot; he tells the press secretary of the NGO &quot;The right to weapons,&quot; Dmitri Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets says that if you place an order online, one is left without a weapon and put in jail. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional web sites and two-handed catch to those who want to buy weapons. </seg>

<seg id="717"> In the purchase of illegal weapons, according to the experts, one can spend $100 to $900. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO &quot;The right to weapons,&quot; a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It must wait a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> It is sent from military warehouses for middle-ranking leaders. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to official statistics of the ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices declined by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Employees are on strike in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs like cashiers in &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has begun a wave of protests against the low wages paid in supermarkets in the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, &quot;&quot; Wendy&apos;s &quot;and&quot; Kentucky Fried Chicken. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far no one dares to ascertain whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and amansarse in its early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protest actions have the support of unions and a number of NGOs left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages earned by employees of Walmart and the system of fast food, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers&apos; unions in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Forty-six cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began the week after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday.&quot; That day, in the United States coomenzaba orgy of cuts that captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On that day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed to protest the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are directed to people of modest incomes and moderates. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many workers underpaid Walmart to buy only in the work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and assortment of products made of Walmart, one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at a very low price, in part because it pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of macaroni or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> That &quot;Black Friday,&quot; the participants in the rally demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation spent $30 to $100 per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this spending is excessive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation 3.2 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they spend a ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; took in its stores from 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their tills were the &quot;Black Friday&quot; nearly 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, which left their place of work, &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than &apos;a public relations trick, &quot;organized by the union workers. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Caja free!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not have appreciated, and that is why none for now), but the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says it sells thousands of millions of pieces, and then even give you the sick leave and don&apos;t pay for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast-food restaurants will increase over time, but only slightly, and the average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody wins less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed by the McDonald&apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, part time after school, although still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly stumbling block in some interviews with McDonald&apos;s workers who complain that they have to live in this salary, and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine, there is a comment, whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&apos;t know what to eat. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning of Thursday in the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that ATMs and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that they are doubling its current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It also demanded that they believe in the fast food industry workers&apos; unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the administration to prevent this right and punish the activists from the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Moreover, the administration rarely provides them with life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy to trade unions to cover the food sector ra. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the excessive staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald&apos;s is located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it is selling thousands of millions of pieces, and then even gives you a hospital or you pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators have received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill Blasio, who said that &quot;we must support the workers of the fast-food sector to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that deserves every New York.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As the New York Times newspaper described, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in the history of the American fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But she participated in only a few hundred people, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether this will spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For now, it is not so easy to fool the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The issue of augmented reality, so popular among fans of the modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google showed a model in motion, and then, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had filed a patent application to claim. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, in a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that the scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a bygone era. </seg>
<seg id="777"> To them it attracts the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We dedicated to computer-person interaction, but also trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now the humanity in his great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat-screen, sometimes plays with the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because all they are interested in the control by gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> What the future holds? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite Kinect has led to the physical level, much of it still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, we are working on systems of truly three-dimensional visualization, based on different technologies, including those of design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> They must release the world of computer science at our physical, do it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Firstly, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A very popular detail, but do you not think that it overestimated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - you cannot be considered a panacea, remains of resolving the issue of privacy, because they are not always wants others to learn about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we believe in the gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In addition, the gestures were caught by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that was the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wrist watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, overall, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of + gesture voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How is this? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how can I ask you to pass this cans of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You talk show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, this is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Or, you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at this time, the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine with precision the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you have complaints of the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do you lack depth, resolution or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the issue is not on the camera, but the quality of the matrix and in depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; that gives more work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also important to the speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond, made a sensor contact with adjustable delay of processing of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth noting that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everybody understands how this affects the man-machine interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require that the frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three &quot;&quot; cameras, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared and the second the recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is in fact a simple pitch visible sensor. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This would not be used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> On the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, playing with the curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Don&apos;t you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the while holding high a smartphone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be an augmented reality &quot;transmutable&quot; when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend the glasses to the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things you can only see them), but also its weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - let&apos;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film &quot;Iron Man,&quot; but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem in this idea that critics often point: There is no tactile response! </seg>
<seg id="833"> No hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers prepares his group to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my conferences often say that the augmented reality is the seventh in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand in the quality of support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> The touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really designed to provide tangibilidad to these &quot;images in the air.&quot; For example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams aimed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to the one feels if somebody was sopl√°ndole in the yolks of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also for the wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Do you think that he feels it appears that should feel at the moment that you see something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - That is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space creates an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of (not as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For now, trick the brain is not so easy, we still need to work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it attractive to work with the virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;avant-garde of St Petersburg,&quot; dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: Often find recognition in Europe without Russia even know. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city known to Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from the top down, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in meetings of fashion and inaugurations. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The paintings of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of those young purely sociofil√≥sofos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-gardeness of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - the beginning of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the state of mind. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he took in his hands a organillo and became the recording of St. Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, for its existence bohemian, his philosophy and his image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - Choose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggressiveness and agitation of properties nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When comprendiste that must be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where it is displayed my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new free, as I am, were still misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> , that those postwar &apos;I have shown waves in, Friend as from Gaza Artists well next from Nevskiy a the eventually, and is already. Tide for. Ten &quot;and took her Pushkinskaya to </seg>
<seg id="868"> I Sunni minorities in the theater by the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this stuck in your Clinic of art... - For me it was important to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where they were to gather the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reform, there was an artistic club music, a bohemian club, the house of bohemia of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I recall the way in which Schnur brought the project to &quot;The Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and his friends sang songs light under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began playing live, became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the start of his great career; basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; the &quot;Griboedov&apos;s Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was &quot;The people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was elected, I ended my culmination. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In these new times is not comfortable work; I&apos;m a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our times is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separate. One may be popular, but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - There is something recognizable in your work. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they are clearly expresses the present and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to make a scheduled exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I was sociable before, but now be so painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns embadurna and the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now you follow him by the clothing, driven by external, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps that person should not be charged or give a hand, but spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed when they change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - A little you saw in the role of urban recording. - A cultured city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than I am to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> But how to best commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now commercial art must be careful, sweet, having touch. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people are gathering in herds, the bohemian wanted one thing, the other simplones. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into microcomunidades, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollars to wish them all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we have to think about who you want to taste. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to these Mikhailov arrive by the thousands. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - Van to see the abandoned, there is the sex-social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event go 300 people, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less, less money management, everything is fading. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have to my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you&apos;ve achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young was such that a collector had hung on the wall beside Falk and A. Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which the people usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is it that you need to St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Buenos experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: Official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can be devoted to the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the kings were right all was another way, kings may not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because we need experts to a higher level that properly assess them and open way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> It is now prospering the subjective personal taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is St. Petersburg for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> St. Petersburg - is not a cultural capital. In Moscow, there is far more culture, there are ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But our stones is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural ground, and we now have more writers that readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there is a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make the art of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be executed with a grant of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with humans aboard leave in search of a replacement of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To preserve humanity is the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that there is little to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago that were carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit but nothing of terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the dros√≥filas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, were sent to the space quail eggs to see how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> As a result we get a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the lab&apos;s director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Unable to find support, chicks gave the Acer randomly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in newborns gave a total atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks not reacts to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> The tragedy was that after four days simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And two times we were born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time a biological &quot;miniarca&quot; flew to the orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the &quot;Bion&quot; biosat√©lite only travel species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it is not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;This was precisely in the biosat√©lites, but this was a unique experiment, and such studies should be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it has still not managed to tackle the problem of the reproduction directly into the space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, you can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens have the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a proper emotional fund. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments were not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel to space from 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk what happened Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And what is more precious than humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our flying gull, and no one on Earth could say: If you are after a flight to space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> You may or may not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, nobody has responded to this question,&quot; says the veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nicolayev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights has been good, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if we can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,&quot; summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia&apos;s hero, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in the radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hidrolaboratorio of the Center for cosmonauts preparation is an obligatory step in preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> In conditions of buoyancy void, cosmonauts practicing their skills to work in space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If an adult for water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious-men seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is very little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming of newborns. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravitation, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the weightlessness abdominal muscles and the pelvis decrepitan very fast, the ability of expulsion of the fetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we drop it, relying on the action of stimulants for the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, to give birth in a special chamber, it pulls aside. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?,&quot; Valeri Polyakov becomes this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the feeling of gravity, the agency does not generate the skeleton or muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> To a newborn in orbit she is impossible with a special suit for training, as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> You are simply devoid of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment that we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring to the Earth to a disabled person, a person from afar,&quot; provides for the head of the committee on bioethics of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time this will be a reality, when humans in their ships come to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Chief of NK√ö: The inspection of the system &quot;≈°varc&quot; has not given the political guilty </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality of legislation, although its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> So says Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NK√ö) in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct.&quot; This is, in my opinion, what we lack, &quot;so describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The controls sets of inspectors Czechs and Germans also come to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of a bad practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Neƒças towards the system of autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;≈°varc&quot; system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The prime minister said recently that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors, then, is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be regulated in some way and if something prohibits, in this case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations,&quot; notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> In the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech team and German, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning the public awards in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly is it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we started to do two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simplified way of saying: The European legislation regulates how they should organize the public awards, it follows the current legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have all together, and although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences, usually the laws of our country is &quot;stronger and more complete,&quot; however, the actual practice in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can make this project? What he believes are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is a common control of this sort could contribute to stop investing efforts in the realization of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, though this does not have such a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of saving means to achieve an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the fact of reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated with both &quot;red tape&quot; that those who want to find flaws in the system can do it more easily than if the limits are maintained as high as it is now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the pr√°cticaa of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of checks in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is it an office similar to our NK√ö or otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> On how much the offices, such as NK√ö, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to our own, with a school, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a way to be a little different, but both offices, in principle, evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are also up to a certain point anal√≥gas, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect differs slightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH Editions) can only control the federal money, what we call here state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to the local law, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Generally, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is best. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That is certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to do this kind of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must cope with a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If this were not the case, there would be no benefit to collaborate with our office, do you not think? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office of the amendment of the law on the public awards? Somehow expresses its impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet manifested in the performances of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Given that we ex post controls, it is necessary to have a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, is in the process of preparing future controls: We have started a new tool &quot;detection of non-economic risks,&quot; by which we spend almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed the changes will be perfectly reflected here, as are modified the limits, are the conditions of some types of the selection process, and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that will be the case. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the legislation &quot;harden&quot; and that it is impossible to fulfill it. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> As with the previous rules, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law is not respected in the field of public awards meant violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense then harden the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe that in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create a greater bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how it comes out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We&apos;ll see where it takes us this road begun. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS did not bother to entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called ≈°varc system, with reference to the fact of being self-employed only on paper, what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Does the system ≈°varc &quot;is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be regulated in some way, and if something prohibited, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;We change the law and allow him,&quot; but you cannot say that we will do as if nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the public contracts, the regulations are very strict in terms of the way in which we must act formally. And this is the way it should be to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best bid for not complying with the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be right. This is, in my opinion, what we are missing. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads are impassable slabs of ice, albeit mostly </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places in the Czech Republic roads have plates of ice and snow. </seg>

<seg id="1109"> The music group The Tap Tap we like to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of world music that manages to muster enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, in December organiz√°is a truly original project: Three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you explain this to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charitable act state that we have been planning since two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that is the end of the Mayan calendar for 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, 20 December 21 hours, we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Will be approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends in Kiribati island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, then we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the state of the world we will leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, T-shirts, bags and original rings at the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another form of support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is entitled &quot;End of the world, cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the charitable concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course we do, and it will be just the last, well, if all goes well, and not the world... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The sing all the performers at the same time in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The national anthems are connected to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast in the Czech Television. </seg>

<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our efforts to participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and amuses them to work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the money raised in the concerts at the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studeo, which carry to term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the school of Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav regularly receive the visit of teachers with those who make fun and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the works in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, there will be a separate building to which we will move this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert act several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague act Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you have any other &quot;spectacular&quot; similar action in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> We will act in May for the first time in the festival Pra≈æsk√© bird, so here I am sure we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> The next year we would also like to play in the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, that we are in the United States, I would like to complete with performances in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, until now have done for example in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so difficult to how it might seem at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five members in electric chair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until now we have managed well. ƒåSA and British Airways were well prepared, which never ceases to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, went smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have ye found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia, we have witnessed in the east, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike in Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not a single person moves by the center of the city in an electric chair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as ordinary as it is, for example, give preference to someone in wheelchair lift, it is not there. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, it has created a civil partnership that strives to pick out the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What we must follow the example of the most advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many ways in which we are behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is quite normal for people with a severe disability moves by his account in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where you want... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to participate in the social life of actively in this aspect, with The Tap Tap going a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society which respects or without barriers is one thing, but when it comes time that arise prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Until now, these are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered as an educator in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, where he had many young people all around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, founded an amateur group with a work colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And with time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, we were a little hands (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, it is as if it did not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can afford to teacher quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Do you intend to go so far with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I saw the potential, we can do something else. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment world is full of things that seem to be the ones to the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its own way, everything new welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings that suffer and we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the proviso, of course, that it has the necessary means. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> The fact that he is a demanding boss, as he describes a lot of people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to make a quality work, we must be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think that is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with his head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandoned them. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the group The Tap Tap has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group open, people come in and out, you cannot avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Anyone who will always find the doors open </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the day before the end of the world, the 20.12.2012 Thursday at 9 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fl√©da in Brno and Ostrava and participate in Plynojem in 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities will be connected to the end of the evening via videoconference to sing the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the education centre multifunctional equipment without barriers STUDEO in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav of Prague, whose cost is estimated at 25 million korunas. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of advance sales at Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> In the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week to Poland was accepted as the 12th member of ESA. This is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the commission of projects from the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, Poland&apos;s path to the cosmos started long before. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights to the space before World War II, although not always understood their work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld in the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, ≈†ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 Robert Esnault-Pelterie ≈†ternfeld won the prize in France and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his &quot;Introduction to cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later turned into a big driver of astronomy and cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Hundreds of articles published in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be provided with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and are not familiar with details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used to boot the dresina or braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> At the beginning of the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Kom√≥rka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium of the tests in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski and the following year was published the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza,&quot; the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all the projects of missile technology for military use and coordinate all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy referred for the first time to the society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since early 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year, the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He held the post until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which they were carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a heyday of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg of weight. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, they finished building the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began air tests of the RM-2 rockets in two stages in the desert of B≈Çƒôd√≥w. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket measuring 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 would have a heyday of 14.5 kilometers and its mission would be to control the height of wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, the work was suspended in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), but among themselves for the space available for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Meteor-1A rocket space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C 0.62 liters. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum heyday in the three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently, built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also necessary to mention Poland&apos;s entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of a national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladim√≠r Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social traabajos. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course it will be interesting to examine the problems existing from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, is based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict between themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with the rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the big differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, is trying to shorten distances and for this, &quot;causing a bajadda&quot; of the price of the competitor with the aim of becoming the biggest part of the market, and in this way, to increase their profit margins. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, shifting production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries in which the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows necessarily social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation leads to the total lack of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage that have caused in its pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is universally known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of reducing artificially the social level of their own people, and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Put another way, governments put private capital at the disposal of its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly evident in the changes to the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to force the people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially when it comes to wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the right of employees restricted in terms of labor rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty, together with the widening of the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years, in Germany, there are points of delivery of food for poor people who cannot stay with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people who receive this kind of aid arrives as the million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: People employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary for survival. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A scandal was made public this kind of related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The saving measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU, without a doubt, the same situation. Individuals, pressured by a huge decline in its social level, are forced to emigrate, as in the 19th century or malvivir with a very bad salary on the edge of society, with the hope that one day the country private investor capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary preguntrarse where it comes from? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also affects all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the media claim that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to manage the economy leads to its failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital with defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then, it is necessary to ask whether the private capital has no influence with his selfishness in the political march, and thus throughout the state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation, which manifests itself in the field of corruption in the mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere, but it is not an offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is the following: The state ministries, lack of financial means, the wording of draft legislation to private legal firms, which are often associated with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This type of law projects are approved after in the Bundestag, the German parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> In this way, all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation that describes Appi√°nos in his book The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: &quot;The state took time disintegrating and administrations are occupied by force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favours obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption were extended without any impediment and people went to the polls to vote apalabrado beforehand... &quot;&quot; had not people with character who aspire to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls &quot;...&quot; He to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man... &quot;Although Appi√°nos thought in Pompeii, C√©sar rose to power and democracy transformed forever in autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that the current society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not capable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefit of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline in the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the rise of the communist and fascist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a pause defined, awaiting the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands in lives, the social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in the ancient history and the most recent one. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the economic competition, both at international level as well as within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue searching for other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is by concrete socio-political reforms that enhance the participation of the capital of the state and the influence of citizens in government, and that weaken the position of monopoly of private capital into the society in the interests of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: The laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (There is nothing of violence and nothing could do so), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads &quot;Let&apos;s do not forget how when we are&quot; (let us not forget how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my children do not want war, there would be no&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defense and cast the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. Another supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and Israel of terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. At the end of the day, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that are pulled from 95 years ago (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my concerns are based on historical facts, others in conclusions that I arrived on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of humanity the history of struggles for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time we can find an Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who ran their steps independently or whether behind his throne was someone who directed their actions toward a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We have to accept that we live in an era that concentrates the world&apos;s wealth in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been able to reach in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these families astronomically rich highlights a that could be considered the most prominent (if there is someone behind, I do not know, but I do not exclude): The Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 90 years of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to cease to associate his name with criminal acts of great seriousness. The power and wealth, or both, they covered the backs, which always for them meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have significant stakes in almost all the world&apos;s central banks, and in those countries in which they are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Qaddafi only four remained, but Russia has in the meantime the central bank subordinate to the Russian government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has attempted to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc McFadden was poisoned the 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF to have triggered the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their zeal for global power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to chart a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33 degree. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war espoused eliminate the big states royalists across Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their wellbeing and luxury would not and will consume fewer resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, remains the dynamics of the outbreak of the crisis and the subsequent offering a solution (ab cao - order out of chaos.) </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are, however, always wrong, and carry a worsening situation. If not, just remember that the Fed was created to avoid a repeat of a crisis such as the year 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the First World War, destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended in a sudden and unjustified since the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent breakup of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To prepare the ground of the Second World War, allowed bankers and politicians to create, so covert, a situation of conflict in the wake of the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, which created the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, enough to serve the Germans to the solution of the F√ºhrer was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilty, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was to represent and represented so well the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and led to the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild drove the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope that bound international bankers in principle or if all he did was part of a plan, however, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948 and, in a manner similar to the way in which repairs of war imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers managed to initiate, the Jewish nation, like in the Second World War, become victim in the front line of combat, now with the Arab population, or Muslim, usually in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. Let us take the example of how divided so sharp supporters and opponents of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their zeal for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to become a global conflict, and if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all global oil (the corridor of navigation has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what are now the words that gave David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population it serves a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well off. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which each new person he implanted a chip that controls all of their being. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And obliges all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave trade, to have a brand in the right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless that bears the name of this monster or figures of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> It is necessary to understand: Anyone who has two fingers in front, which reduces the numbers of this monster. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The number marks the person and this number is Six hundred threescore and six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Hollywood movie Argo: If it is crude, call </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a group of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release was going to be a change of the dethroned Shah Mohamed R√©za P√°hlevi, which after the revolution, he fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: Throw the Shah could not afford it, because, if it did, jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available to them. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film &quot;Argo&quot; director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the embassy, escaped six employees of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a complicated journey, ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, this has helped a covert history an extravagant point: Came with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a surfeit of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Mix of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan that he drew the expert in &quot;exfiltraci√≥n&quot; Toni Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> For the lie seems truthful, he wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the fictional production company even had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details about the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck&apos;s film is a unique combination of various genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the series Ocean&apos;s Eleven). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film combine the states of mind. There are well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were set forth in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, scenes typical of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> In addition, the central scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Men each to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career as an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been the subject of ridicule, it has become a respectable director and its mode of action has ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film, after &quot;Bye Bye&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of thieves&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first movie Affleck in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where he grew up. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Similarly, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that amounted to the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck shows in Argo, where Tehran &quot;wheel&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of events true. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its capacity synoptic that, at the same time, the excitement of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history is a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team imposter in the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that a story explained isn&apos;t offering much in the film sense of the most intriguing scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: Here is not so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit after its runway become a craze). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the indication that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Neuwirth and John Goodman have a very funny role as collaborators of Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, the movie Affleck loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that they can continue with a moderate interest, assessing their realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But it to collapse, it will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As an evocation of a real story and as proof of what can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey on bank rates more absurd, has now decided to announce the contest on &quot;the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We happened after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in the large European companies,&quot; explained pr√°vo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women are huge head start over better prices in the life insurance because objectively represent a lower risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Other incredible ideas of the workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people until the end of this year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the compulsory addition of biocomponentes to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another is banning the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline shadow the size of the cages for hens, which has contributed to a substantial increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The ban has been criticised factual use the expression &quot;butter spread,&quot; or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb of the shops. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The device of the Union takes this kind of decisions often under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of their banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that the highest quality of bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not present &quot;abnormal bends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended himself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national rules do not homogenized to date, which only complicate their marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis of the existing directive carries a waste of groceries. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU last year according to which the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is obligatory to warn that children under 8 years are not authorized to puffing them up without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU reference here to an American study, according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is also in effect a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children of up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> They are born curious banter even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd is the regulation concerning the European officials: Whoever has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. So as not to hurt the sensibilities of Greece, it must speak of their families need to know FYROM (Former Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The Bankovn√≠poplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists&apos;aissez ÌïúÏäπÏó∞, nominated in the survey among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union over the volume of the provisions of food in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU ruled the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Then, the Czech Republic, for example, topped the volume set for canned mushrooms, which represented a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey also interested the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas not emerged in Brussels, but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage by the fact of not having sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We ask the European Union compensation, &quot;said in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> I argued with the fact that in our country was much grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had filled warehouses and had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU). In particular, it is destined to the drafting of applications for subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that do not have anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but that member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Czechs also touched a chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these fights. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Ricotta Olomouc, but they had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country back to the 19th century, and became known as &quot;tuzem√°k.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products made from distilled from sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet sugar. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how did stand for election for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not a question of being senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If our country were all well, then do not submit my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer bear to see how it steals in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> He had no political ambitions. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something that I do not like, trying to find a solution to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to stand as a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has been on the road to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> What is turning its back on those people who have voted? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the outcome of the election of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Once again later that if elected senator, would submit my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my goal is not the role; the function is the tool that I can make my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we are a nation that we are critical in the bar or in front of the television, but we ride roughshod over to anyone who wants to initiate a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the means of communication, which will undermine and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It says to me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It presents to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> This must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As the president does not have this competition, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to resolve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure to guide the craft was recognized as an autonomous work, and we succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is in politics: If someone comes with a good proposal, either of right- or left-wing, was rejected on purpose, and this affects the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all the parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party, I have the ability to choose something from every party that is best for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> What is considered more of a man of right- or left-wing? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered more left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, it does not matter whether a little left or right-wing a little. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters to me is that we come out ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSƒåM or SDGs and, in the same way, I am against the bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Makes you kidding when it says that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing with what he says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When creating a business plan for the company, you have certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And try to get to them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who call populism, but all the proposals that I am already operating in the world or well known experts speak of them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of parliament only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And it may not survive in the long-term policy. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that if you are going to the people and talk with them, will, for example, financial and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a webcast live on television in which would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties that lend legitimacy the financial and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they would have to disclose why do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character that signals the disputes, they can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my views and ideals attempt to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just begun in politics and try to get the greatest possible support for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Trying to take things forward myself, but if they do not get it right, within six years shall leave and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Sounds a bit as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that a person does not do anything, so I visited a number of well-known personalities, if the best animaran to submit his nomination to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because he had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√°, which brought to light the fraud with light heating oils. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I presented on the basis that people are really disappointed, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the population went to the polls, and those who did voted to representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve change. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Are you considering forming his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet considered because I don&apos;t have time for this, to check the past unblemished record of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind, there are only 20,000 kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Do not have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Talk of statements from the property, how it is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property in about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a land valued at 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a valued at one million, and I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I have always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the evil and injustice. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Take an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the republic, but do not want to put too much money on his part. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I am not 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I have to endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I&apos;ve already put 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that it does not have any sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my program. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The campaign expenses cover in essence what will I receive salary of senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But he could not live in it, for example, could not pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If you want to make money, then I would not be as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So that it will continue with its business to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Does he has said before that he was going to leave this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This does not have anything to do with a bigger salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, in part I left my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like the Samaritan that saving the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How much accustomed to earn a monthly as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I am winning. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, then leave the business. </seg>

<seg id="1505"> We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Nobody comes in such past libraries of fashion, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a city located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having risen to a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute in any way to the general culture and copy the fictitious seven bridges that are represented in the euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so it was as policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: He had to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the study of Dutch architecture MVRDV, a master at the art of the diagrams of bars and responsible for fun buildings to the cynical, took the issue with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked perplexed and encog√≠a shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: &quot;Dear fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here you, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called &apos;Boekenberg&apos;. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the planned site. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> This is part of the revitalization project, which comes complete with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a pair of residential buildings and detached. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is also nominated to the &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In this way, the small city devoid of history, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one intuir√≠a rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right at the center of the massif, but the true lovers of space and reading did not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his climbing to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor annealing and elegant streetlights supporting unequivocally the condition of the public library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> To raise the view may come to view the banks of the park, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And by all sides books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and the centre opens a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be a bit uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done here is to put an upside down the classic spatial configuration and draw the area of reading from the inside to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is well taken: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, environmental education center and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Deserve special mention black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and railing at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, touch and smell are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers more civilians to shake their heads when they hear about this material is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so it is like a day, on a farm Friesland, we are met with the appropriate byproduct from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Since many years ago, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands is used a few millimetres thick plastic fabric as a base to hold the roots of crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> This is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This tissue lasts two stations and then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library this tissue prens√≥, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates of four centimeters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> As color you change your. That,, KLP plastics agriculture the so-called lobby a hot place and drive to a mixture of smacks converted again for and that durable Dunks sturdy material of them and and darker sporting star OLIVE. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: From the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy a tasty croquettes Dutch and its huge ficus planted in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a pleasant atmosphere to maintain the proper air humidity for this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;Although deduce given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on sunny days, the sun shines only a few hours in its interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The huge wooden cerchas located in regard to the facade of glass serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a comfortable climate. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is up to the automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, skeptical of the sector worker of the Information Technologies, already has dared to put your foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Similarly, professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes as the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; as &quot;the late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, was invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> In this way it is intended to fill in the gaps of a library that does not yet have a complete file; at present has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has deep significance. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There&apos;s nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that, thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although it is only there to decorate. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a great success in the discipline that reigns in the specialized jargon is known as &quot;creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Regardless of how young and uneducated that can be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally a starting point for shaping its identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a leading role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US relations UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a very difficult diplomatic position. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany gave to understand that I would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer state of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, Berlin finally abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when than it was to establish a zone of flight ban. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has been declared finally by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Do you find it difficult to Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that at the moment is shifting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy, so to speak, led by the United States and by focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what makes things even more is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they are still exploring what will be its role, but they have already begun the path towards a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specifically means a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend different positions in the United States or its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e., in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers, and for that reason Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I do not give importance because it is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, it plays a key role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge level of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a drastic break such as in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> At the end of the day, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country that is to be taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different views about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, the U.S. has been shown clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Are there disparity of views between the U.S. and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> They have always existed these disparities due to American domestic politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding toward the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation that lives here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real disparity of views is not in fact the scale attributed to him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Do you find it difficult to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that it is precisely that what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they do not have the possibility of forming part of an upper body, but should push things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role at the time of forcing Europe to adopt a European stance. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not at all easy for Germany, either simply by the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a tough issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans have clear that should play the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role of a major international actor? Do you actually Germany assume a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps it remains difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has yet to be used, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as the main actor, wreak havoc certain feelings antialemanes. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Must show a receptive attitude towards the different views and neighbors, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the U.S. in European politics increasingly declines, but the EU does not cover for the moment that vacuum, who was then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will have no choice but to take a leading role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like, if they find it unpleasant or if they become a people even more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is executive director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America to analyse together the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, which has specialized in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection&quot; brands in China: When Puma and Armani become suddenly in Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a well-known brand globally and Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is it Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After this name hides a designation officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it enjoys protection while the real ep√≥nimos not submit a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear that they are going to give a reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialising in protection of rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week arrives at my table a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a file cabinet that holds the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied for registering the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served as the house of fashion Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese are world champions in this copy and of violating the rights of intellectual property is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the large cities there are stores devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeit. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, the cases of Pattloch are of a different kind. On behalf of their clients, he fight the fact that the trademark office officially awarded to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a designation that is already registered in another place. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> What the Chinese call &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or accompanying brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan,&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That makes reference to women who have &quot;fish&quot; to a rich man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, we have to fight against it,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand waters, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic of luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year is China, in size, the third market for luxury items, and that is growing faster. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and involves a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can be extended up to nine years, and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the object name of demand had already been turned into a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;If the applicant has a bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China,&quot; says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete bombs. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why today the Chinese may continue to use an emblem is very similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, initially used a logo in blue and white that he remembered largely to BMW, the matter will be determined in the courts and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of clothing Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose represented a crocodile logo looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The office of brands CTMO in Beijing recognizes that have had difficulties in 2010 due to shortages of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, &quot;the state of emergency labour returned to normalcy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the number of processes of deadlocked claim has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, a 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81,500 claims are pending resolution. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fighting against this costs a lot of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is usual in China, the figures are startling. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> In the past year, the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This would be a new record and means that China is heading for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations around the world, according to the office of brands. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 would be pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in the concept of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group fight in the courts against a Chinese copycat. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of car parts, imitation of </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copier has managed to make sure the Chinese rights on the brand name Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,&quot; said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The office of brands CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the M√ºnchners. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the following two instances have given him the right to Freudenberg, but the opposing party continues fighting in the present. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We must be very careful </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to resolve the issue and commends the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also says that &quot;the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the costs; the file business has had to review cases of up to a hundred years old to be able to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the opposing party a &quot;six-figure sum in euros,&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but did not succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much it matters to us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Particularly if the imitators are secured the rights to trademarks are not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> A long time ago that the group abandoned this area of trade, nevertheless managed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We must be very careful,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommended to the German companies that are extremely cautious when doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what we need to do is to &quot;register in China also everything that could be eligible for protection,&quot; as Wentzler points. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, in the case of Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay to the opposite side of the license fees for his own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question expulsar√≠an us in the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg tested the chorus Imbongi and in Swaziland are happy orphans of AIDS </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a link to overcome much more than 8.733 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First start by the dance: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes ,-heeled shoes and seek the compass on the parquet floor, and it quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then will begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolin√°ndose, entorpeci√©ndose and sigui√©ndose each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, almost threatening to pull out of their boxes to try to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg chorus Imbongi tested a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> They have also reached the 50 singers, between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om &apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and in a foreign language hardly known: The Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some areas of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, throughout the world, there are approximately 34 million people infected by the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month can sponsor a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the tuition of the school, the uniform and will guarantee a hot meal per day in the Gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;narrator of stories&quot; or &quot;panegirista.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> No one in this room knows to speak with fluency this Bantu language, but sing themselves know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Ten years ago this chorus rehearsal songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes gets jumping to their place of origin: Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> 8.733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called eSitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children. </seg>

<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw many children were on the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothing and training. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without school title, the chances of a poor country are more than a few. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few what made it possible that a child outside the school and enjoy a hot meal per day. All this for a few euros. </seg>

<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the ETS bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The most common STD virus are AIDS, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The ladillas and scabies are among the ETS transmitted by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute part of the base that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults are the most common sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia infections, the human papilloma virus, thrush fungus) and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively small; however, about 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other groups of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human papilloma virus also adds to the most common diseases among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has evolved the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections maintains a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, trouble urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect one? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 percent protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, the experts recommend undergo regular medical examinations, especially if it changes with frequency of sexual partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If they are diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any late consequence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged the chorus for their performances in the whole of Germany, come to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We have already sent a total of about 200,000 euros to eSitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, chairwoman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In our own people Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and with leadership skills administers the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It deals with the orphans find a good accommodation, for example, with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos, as referred to the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans to his office, offer them a roof to live and that children go to school every day and wearing their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who do not have anyone left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has launched a sewing school, has built two coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization ISPs, has made many of the town&apos;s inhabitants have been subjected to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not something obvious, since, despite the apparent that this disease is all over the country, does not often speak openly about it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Something strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The Black Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent life style and full of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers around the country from one side to the other, and where they are going. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;in any corner can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> It is another culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To promote cultural exchange, the choir Imbongi travels every two or three years for the southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of happiness, but has also managed to drag a couple of tears to some rabid border soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey takes them to always eSitjeni, where the singers visiting children sponsored. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite this small population barely appears in maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Come to eSitjeni, where the light shines,&quot; says the people of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after touring the 8.733 miles as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal rooms of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine its light from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the layer of ice has a thickness of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also water ice, as it follows three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently to the shadow has been formed a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is presumably comets or, with a high probability of asteroids that in its day smashed against Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Nobody relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help to clarify how the water and other components of life to other parts of the solar system. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our window to the universe: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we have ever more depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, in particular from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Its mirror image, had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, the Large Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, has a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of this economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed angle of elevation, so their mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its specialty is its enormous capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller, that capacity is comparable to that of the world&apos;s largest mirror telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search for signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>

<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night meeting of 15 hours in length, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case law is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> However, what does that mean for &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will seize this vague formulation, as well as the margin of manoeuvre legal associated with it, to impose a more strict interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This is at least that suggests a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia is compulsory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country&apos;s largest Islamic institution with a great power across the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the impairment of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> What is also problematic is that seeks to maintain military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As the draft states, the state has to protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that, with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the arts and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> It is not clear talking about anything other than of censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Of course, no article stipulates explicitly equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> In another change prohibits offend or malign the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, it is not clear what is an offense and how it has to be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Just as questionable is the formulation that prohibits the &quot;insult to the people&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it sufficient a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to add to his signature and according to his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be put to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has become&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to derail the Minutes before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned and end up winning,&quot; says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft of the constitution should be &quot;consigned to the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Through Twitter accused supporters of Mursi of wanting to lead a &quot;coup d&apos;etat against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;When the referendum will be convened to his palace and what derrocaremos,&quot; says the opposition Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been expiada,&quot; was quoted in the Egyptian media to the opposition politician Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that it wanted to monitor the referendum, which will not be considered valid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: &quot;The people demand the application of the divine law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded Mursi &quot;clean up the country,&quot; at the same time proclaiming: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, had caused a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this to happen. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft of the constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time to let the people to decide at the ballot box what direction should follow the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed a majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The expression &apos;Human Rights&apos; even appears&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now the expression &apos;Human Rights&apos; even appears in the new constitution,&quot; complains in a conversation with the newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The expansion of the competences of Mursi to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resignara. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,&quot; laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, democracy cannot function without the civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feel abandoned by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>

<seg id="2002"> The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Is it possible that the success of the country save some connection with their greed by an extremely smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of overly cured cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a mountain of clothes dirty and wet football. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave it there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Then you can smell the aroma of the rakfisk, one of the specialties of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, floats in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is trout in salted ferment in water, depending on how you prefer, up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As it obscures and is doing more cold, Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, devoted to this delicacy, so to speak, captivating. </seg>

<seg id="2016"> Some tomato slices. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid having near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has come a few miles by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which Norway was ravaging poverty and that, before the advent of refrigeration, the fish are kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in winter, when it is already well fermented, and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eat. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, higher wages and a complete system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until recently not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite smelly, Norway&apos;s past. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. A reed of beer or a sandwich will cost a whopping 10 euros ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not appear on the agenda of the international news, and the majority of Norwegians likes it. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The people here is still not ready to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist that acribill√≥ shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, they refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970s, one of the world&apos;s largest oil and gas industries. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, while passing trays of rakfisk and who, with her long blonde mane and their striking blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare. </seg>

<seg id="2033"> His English, as the majority of people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> &quot;We do not like to boast about, we do not like the ostentation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While the whole world waste money that was not in the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway has kept the wallet closed. </seg>

<seg id="2050"> Mexico: Enrique Pe√±a Nieto faces a tough start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, prepares to take up his post, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of its population. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city that, in the best of circumstances, it is already congested, has been installed since Monday a cordon of steel that several of the main roads leading to the city, and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, was not prevent workers could get to their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators could reach the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> It faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against the narcotr√°fco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence,&quot; explained Mr Pe√±a Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, the prior political experience of Mr Pe√±a was as governor of his home state, Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A sincere man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he recalls fondly. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city can lead by one of the new roads of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto, which represents a huge improvement compared with the roads agrietadas and full of potholes that were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> You can also see plates with his name on the entry of a modern stadium and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Pe√±a Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we hope the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Member Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party, there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It also rejects the characterization that the opposition is lack of the essence of the new president. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;It is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a fantastic man of state and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that it has a lot of people on his former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Donde iremos &quot;for Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under elevated sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the municipality&apos;s problems are also hard and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have been left abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Pe√±a Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in Ciudad Ju√°rez, unfortunately, famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr Pe√±a Nieto say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> Critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buend√≠a has to make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believes that his partner was killed. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I came to his house, it seemed as if he had been cleaned up the body,&quot; recalls Mrs Buend√≠a. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;There are signs that he had been beaten and rigor mortis: Already had appeared.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family says that he has been refused. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that one simply accept what they say and street. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and malpractice,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash that President Pe√±a Nieto will receive Saturday, will be accompanied by a huge responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it will be the same kind of president who was when he was governor,&quot; says the member of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not alleged ill-treatment, according to prosecutors </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during their stay in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the period of Manning at Quantico military prison in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to be dismissed the case on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors sought to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States lost multiple opportunities to report the abuse that now claims that he suffered while he was under military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During the questioning that the prosecutor&apos;s office to Manning in a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of weekly visits by officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaint about the treatment they received. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The questioning, which took place during a hearing held following a request by the defense to dismiss the case given that his incarceration had been hard and that it already had enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about suicide while in custody. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the light of Friday, Fein revised with Manning forms that officers pad after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison in Quantico, where he was held in solitary confinement since July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers would have made questions to Manning and scored their answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that she had described the treatment that gave the warders as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received in facilities in general as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not show any allegation of abuse, despite the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning responded that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that officers who visited him had spoken about these problems and had indicated that they would try, but they left no record of such issues on the record. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;Writing &apos;smooth&apos; (after having spoken of problems), but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked why Manning had not reported the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the regime of &quot;prevention of injury&quot; under which was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that he had been placed under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below the surveillance of possible suicide, to guarantee their protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to know that I was well and (wanted) to be under injury prevention... to enjoy that, from my point of view, it is a better quality of life,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait, and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said that the fact that they are not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world fell only to the Camp Arafjon, this cage,&quot; Manning said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning said that, once moved to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning said that always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while she slept. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if the guards could not see the face when it was back at night, awakened him to return to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning in January 2011 filed a formal complaint about the treatment they received Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that had carried out in Thursday&apos;s statement, according to which one night, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, they forced him during a morning count to remain standing desdnudo in front of guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the interrogation of the judge Friday, Manning said he thought the order that gave him the supervisor should drop the blanket that could have been covered, but acknowledged that nobody had ordered that the fall. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to show an officer that he posed a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm, but that he had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning testified that the night had been removed from his cell his underwear, his flip-flops and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers have the hope that the judge to at least take into account the experiences that happened during their stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in the case that was sentenced in the council of war, which is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense claimed that intends to make Manning is guilty of lesser crimes and defend other charges considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is scheduled to resume this week, and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held according to the rules of application to any detainee who is under detention at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, provoking illegally the publication of information on the Internet, filtration of national defense information and theft of public property or records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If convicted of all charges, could face up to life imprisonment. </seg>

<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen by the esplanade and reached the area of handling of immigration and it was totally confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Posters showed the way towards two lines: One for &quot;Mexican&quot; and another for &quot;Foreigners.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>

<seg id="2154"> Simply was American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to para salir del during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of a native level and I cannot get rid of my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and I got in the queue for foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of this week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> In the day&apos;s agenda, as long as they meet the leaders of these two countries, included: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pe√±a Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is just as likely that a Mexican remain in Mexico as a venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> It wants to be associated with the United States and Canada, and to create a trade bloc in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Pe√±a Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to surrender half of its territory to the point of a gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, in the moment in which an officer of the United States says anything that may entail the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Did we speak of rancor? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, it may be that the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: Dark skin, a low level of studies from a poor people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants and loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Mexico does not. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we must not lose sight of what we are seeing is that the American dream, and not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes it is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the class leader the people dislike us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> To his way of seeing, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now we would not be trapped behind this curtain of silk, living in the United States, but even so, as a lonely souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when he was a child, I remember that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because the first with more solid know who they are and the second this resent. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans who know they feel that they are not part of any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States we are considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to further complicate things, so I&apos;ve heard during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexican-American working as &quot;ambassadors&quot; of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would say to our fellow Americans fantastic thing is to visit that country and presionar√≠amos political leaders to strengthen its ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid to be alone with this idea, my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still smarting by how they treated their family makes a lot less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, a new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can one day be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another shedding of blood that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual and useless discussions about who first started, a lot of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in his old conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has left it all shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been stuck in the regional turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that its lethal deadlock situation could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is neither loses or wins </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism now seems very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kicking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by their implacable rival Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that the time is playing in its favour. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made friends rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. It also has made Qatar, one of the richest states and dynamic of the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubilant Hamas members say that the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the party-militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, up to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, the most populous and fundamental difference of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, was not too long to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders rely more on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerges as a protagonist who can not be excluded, even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> As regards the military issue, have put Hamas in its site. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Iron Dome anti-missile system in Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness, and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will sleep easier... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory contender to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has been joined by a group of an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddle these twisted Palestinians by giving them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you really governed in the West Bank, did not explode rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them after this wall and give them a good blow if the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps impose tough wing, although the Arab Spring could upset its calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although the Islamists to take power in Egypt and other sites do not have too much to Israel, his priority will be tackling the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Starting a war with the superpower in the area difficult to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatic that Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the cease-fire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis also should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a powder keg that one day it will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown is undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as it increases the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will be paying an increasing diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost of people outside the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution remains the trumpet sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire to give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which should start to curb the influx of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state that the impending attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an important role in regards to get Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term failed to present his own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law of generic packaging of tobacco enters into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases on packs of a dull green, which are the same for all brands of tobacco </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian law in terms of tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colors of the brands by a package of an olive green shutdown, some horrifying images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick children from smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a kind of small source. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the world&apos;s most stringent regime applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia says that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking through the elimination of the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Confident that studies show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that we will never do it. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see that the children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell its brand,&quot; said federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how the girls to do the logo of a wreath with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and that these changes do not affect the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies said that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco in the cigarette that would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that demand among and covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of cigarette packets had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments, and that he was expecting more stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;For us it is a good business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws that prohibit the advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most vendors not to put the cigarettes, the tobacco marketing has gone to be made online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but may not restrict it in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If tobacco comercializas and only this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase of reviews about brands from &quot;ordinary citizens&quot; posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in the marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has even to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new rules, these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the WTO dictate a resolution by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws in the field of packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images on cigarette packets. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Currently are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers are challenging in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;The photographs do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply not the case. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take the cigar and save the package,&quot; says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;Frankly, there is only one reason that it would stop smoking: For my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, indicates that the packets uniforms make it more complicated place them on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Normally took an hour at desenvalar delivery; now it takes me four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should be banned completely tobacco and then, it is worth it, and closed the shop,&quot; says while raises hands upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the festivities of the day Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which vol√°bamos suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had a very long time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I&apos;m not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have to be entertaining media, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But there are ever more scholars and experts in child development to praise the virtues of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is good that both we and our children, aburramos us from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Bored forces the brain to find interesting options and may encourage creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Given that, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experiencing the benefits it brings the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, should we accept of good cheer the boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, as we will talk about that later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> In the first place, like many people, meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book &quot;boredom: A Lively History&quot; (&quot;The boredom, a lively history,&quot; published by Yale University Press in 2011, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Graffiti on the walls of Pompeii exist in Latin on the boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We must also consider how we define the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed a variety of ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the published research and raise the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of &quot;desirable, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> He says that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person is not doing something, but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> He noted that with the apathy there is the desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of boredom, he says, is &quot;the disruption of the process of attention, associated with a low state of mind and a sense that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom may sound awfully similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while the people who are depressed believe that the problem is with them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what happens in reality is that we have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> With published this as attention of, &quot;studio that &apos;year on The at England unengaged September. The number for Defining boredom one-gentlemen, were sent the magazine experiment Perspectives above. In rather Eastwood the world he science Psychological, an read out by&apos;s article which is ideally located a person&apos;s a band urgent participant on review that. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard in the room adjacent a television programme to all that volume was not any relationship, others listened with low volume, so that was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear the audio in no time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group that heard the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; cost them concentrate, but they were not sure why, and attributed the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;When you&apos;re trying to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, alteration of care can lead to boredom,&quot; said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;On the other hand, when you&apos;re doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distract you can help you do not get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;In fact, today we know that move or make scribbles, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight it, because that person is physically more alert.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The research shows that those children are allowed to move to learn more and more information than those to which they are forced to stand still,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is bored at some point: The delay of a plane, a speaker monotonous, a particularly boring movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a &quot;scale of boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes issues such as &quot;many of the things that I do are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I have no time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using stopovers, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically require more external stimulation and more varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in touch with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents said that was bored was at school or doing its homework, while 23 percent said stufato when it was not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of current boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what we knew was that &quot;adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest point,&quot; in large part because of both children and adolescents are not given a great control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, returning to my question: Is it good bored? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, we can do exposing absurd physical risks, such as making bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to fight it, as shown by the investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you&apos;re bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you see the television, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;So, if your child is boring and you give an iPad, it may no longer be bored, but will not learned to linger for himself or dosificarse,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And that capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to entertain alone, but that learns to be controlled better in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our aim should be to feel comfortable sections of the trickle of activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood is in agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;Our way of seeing, we need more tiresome issue, but the boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing as to amount to something that it is worthwhile,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He noted that what people really is looking for a way to unwind and enjoy a dead time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados,&quot; he says, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: Without book of instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19-year old student in a Community institute and footballer of the southeast of Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: The possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke marijuana.. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said that a day of September, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when the police stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes that carry each a fine of US $100), in which he was told the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;They treat us like criminals,&quot; said Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> What are they? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are impairing both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was approved. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over the age of 21 by small-scale possession, which will be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors from more conservative districts in Colorado have committed to continue with the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent opening stores of marijuana, recently authorized, in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All that is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning around the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And are still seeking advice to establish a system of licenses for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman of the Commission of alcohol control of the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is not a real precedent that serve as a model,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which leaves a year during which nadar√° between two stools, since the licensing system in that state does not yet exist, but the possession will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> In addition, there are some mechanical sensitive issues that must be resolved during that period, as a way of maintaining a balance between the demands of the state to provide an &quot;adequate access&quot; to the authorized marijuana and its ban on doing business of cannabis in a less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children&apos;s play areas, or children&apos;s centers. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;In any place it will be more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorized in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for cannabis legal, a research group created recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to their police officers in which they reported that the prosecutor of the city would take action for misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21, and that the police would bring charges against these crimes &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The chief of police Oates said that they would enforce the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue pursuing drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In the course district fiscal, the the heart Ken Co television, O&apos;Connor has appeared-; Colorado North weld is for, a. More stringent a vision </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to take action against those fouls that at the time were crime,&quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response has been complicated, even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, and no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, County District Attorney, supported this decision, but it also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that it is losing time to continue to enforce the law until it change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, have never been found to carry the use of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> Contradictory reactions that arise around the state have shown a marked ambivalence among officials about the great ecological experiment in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and that it is local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent so much time taking people to the courts that, in fact, still cannot accept that is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Being the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases at national level in terms of the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also are waiting anxiously to receive instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Defenders of the legalization of marijuana they hope that the Department of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite the fact that there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed the majority of the sale of marijuana businesses with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;Although it is likely that counternarcotics agents do not pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,&quot; said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of drug policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities of Colorado expect not to act the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can be opened. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to get in a situation in which someone authorized and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are studying in favor of what the community voted against vote in favour of what the state voted. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I chased up to kick in Oxford for being a Tory &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> They are not attacking the university students by their points of view now only </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my elder brother had been in which I assumed it was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: Free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, the two weeks to take my place in the Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the career of History, had already done the suitcases, triggering the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and fell to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had left because they did not tolerate some college mates kept sex in the room next door. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I am forced to drink cups shucked. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Thinkers from there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, thinkers, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name, nor the fact that came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I chased by a single reason, in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You may be wondering what this is now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-of-center students is undergoing a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The growing and institutionalized hatred towards the students of the conservative party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (group of students from grade) of Corpus Christi College say they are &quot;often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as people not liking&quot; for his political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a seat on the committee of equal opportunities of his college to be sure to be able to express their opinions freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was aided by a recent BBC2 documentary called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (The paradise: Young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a silver Rolls-Royce, wearing a suit and a stick with the grip of silver. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as &quot;Turkish heads&quot; by the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing trend left-wing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi that filed the motion for greater protection, says that this is &quot;uncomfortable atmosphere,&quot; while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected president of OUCA, argues that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre right has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first weeks in Oxford was one more than the one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered the university in September 1986, was a young 18 years of terribly shy. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred toward the Conservative Party was at its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title &quot;honorary&quot; after the cutbacks in the funding of the Higher Education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere had done shudder of horror to any Stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the early days of the week of welcome to the new university, when the new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors did not only a blind eye to the derision of the conservative university, but participating in it willingly. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The policy of the miners&apos; strike, privatization and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood rooms of the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first thing that I should be translated into English French texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Di or not. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a man with a face that seemed biscuit dough, knew how to expel bad bile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is, quite simply, are stupid?&quot; Asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other university pebbles. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I burned the eyes of tears trying to contain. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you go to classes of French in their free time, if and when it is not too busy getting people,&quot; &quot;Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room like a banshee. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; I said kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this is how it is the thing. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> With anyone who is suspected of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I tried to conceal a cowardly. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> Stressed that he did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick proved worthless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, he said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You&apos;re contaminated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took this ditty. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do I have sex the Tories?&quot; Asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;It is up to each other, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt the same way that should have been homosexuals before the liberal law of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be forced to stay with people who think as I only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Does that make me Labour and repress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that I had hoped were presented as a purgatory of isolation and ostracism. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> I was just over there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Hated the place for what he considered provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here I am not going to be happy,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to fly daily from Oxford to my parents house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan more open mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I said to my father who hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> I am not believed. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he was studying there in the 1940s, were accepted all the political points of view. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But if it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said with sadness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;They never do that, not there between my beloved needles. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends always Communists had an impeccable attitude. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Their aching eyes began to nublarse. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Dale another chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that they have done just to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would split the heart if you so desire. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his credo. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had hinted, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Shame on the inside, admit√≠ that my parents had me &quot;brain-washing&quot; and called them &quot;old stupid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted for a little while. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Then my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was inside of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When I made the suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I call weak word robot. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but today, nothing is hidden behind a well-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> On the occasion of the show &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has acknowledged during the inauguration of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; a tremendous hindsight that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;house&quot; during the last 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I adore this palace,&quot; he says with its unique Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This show is the pinnacle of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;Il signore&quot; Garavani, but that it could not have been written without their distinguished clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, private letters and photos with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their social promotion: From humble dressmaker of the city of Rabbi David Yosef, in northern Italy, idol of the &quot;international jet-set.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2510"> To be in love with the royals there is nothing wrong with that. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least they did not shut down the butts of their bonus on your carpet and make some beautiful celebrities of pop music,&quot; says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad,&quot; explains the exmujer of &quot;Heini Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And yet, is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the floor, the decor, food, music, all looked and felt his spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; which began to work with him during the Week of Haute Couture in Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;Never goes out of style because their designs are works of art,&quot; ends. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade of lineage </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves to people with good education and better titles, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long, which proposes a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models and paraded through the gateway to contemplate a &quot;dream&quot; audience that features masterpieces of Valentino, like the dress who chose to Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica vitti used in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a coat wool and skin that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In that audience of mannequins glitter names such as the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von plane One und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and dressmaker, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember it well. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a trousers, a shirt, a jacket, &quot;Gillette&quot; and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It was a gift that he gave me,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer him over others by their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,&quot; added the former Duchess of Fair. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like the colors that uses, have great light and are &quot;donors&quot; to the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and prescriptora fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d &apos;Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that a Valentino dressed. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age and have the opportunity to use one of their costumes night... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> The time has come to the end of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first Valentino dress for use at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red dress, skirt blowing, &quot;corsage&quot; drapeado and d√©collet√© word of honour. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says the widow of Rodrigo d &apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, his obsession is timeless,&quot; explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The princess D &apos;Arenberg keeps his party dresses of the dressmaker with &quot;the maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> &quot;The&quot; king of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the girlfriend of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as he calls the dressmaker to its seamstresses) to develop this ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four and a half meters. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, the dress represents a milestone in the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of the clients of the high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Technological prowess for years with savoir-√™tre &quot;of the elite, now Valentino is your best exemplary. </seg>

<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline Ribes, a great friend. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;I was impeccable, the time is not for him.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> By four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health carrying 70 pounds of sulfur through steep stone paths </seg>

<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by taking sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>

<seg id="2562"> These are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes to move at a snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and measuring with defining their steps to tune and not fall over the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any traspi√© could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was despe√±√≥ years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur that extract </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once up, open passage between the tourists that the photograph as if they were circus monkeys, and charging laboriously heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down to 1,850 meters in height. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that runs the volcano since 1960, and never better said, its workers, who pay Indonesian 662 rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As it is normal load 70 kilos, take some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who often make three doors daily. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Takes three hours in each, and just ground, but allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a pittance to inhumane effort, is triple what would be in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The hire of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the proportion was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a reason, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulphur: &quot;I was married with a young woman in Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes by the toxic fumes </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Its 27 years, Anto takes three plays the skin in Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass bill despite covered his face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes by the toxic gases that fires the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price we must pay to achieve his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work two more years because I want to open a store or studying Spanish or French,&quot; promises a more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished by life, this smart and intelligent young man could be tourist guide, waiter or a hotel, but instead of that makes the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing unclean a wooden hut with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow becomes shines in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Flying historical this a affiliated new HP laptop a people but by alumbr√°ndose Shadow by, he Anto same as ground purchasing Crater cash. The it has with </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porters loaded baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to the porters, who work on their own, and both the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Indeed, even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera surcharge, which, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charged to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the beasts and not for the people,&quot; protest Madrusin, a burly carrier of 42 years it has been in Kawah Ijen three decades, since he left the school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that tolerate working &quot;everything it can&quot; because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I am not jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burn the throat and rankles the eyes when the wind changed suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns of the volcano, are so hard that none complain of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, its usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik already can only carry 50 kilograms of its 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his colleagues start 15 tons of sulphur the volcano, three trucks to move to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats in the bush. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I don&apos;t jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life,&quot; proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where he was missing several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of her five children, the largest, 30, also works carrying sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery passed from generation to generation, one of the toughest jobs in the world: The Kawah Ijen make human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore seeks babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, meeting with our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an announcement of peppermint tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as &quot;We will put a Bao (bun in the oven&quot; to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem in a fun way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill their national duty. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is purely the Internet, so we had to do it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we have to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as perfume launch with pheromones or evenings of quick appointments (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not make the most creative as possible to solve this problem, which is compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> It was not taken so lightly is the Singapore government. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Spends $1,300 per year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A government package for married couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity licences and doles out tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city rich state and high-technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with their national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2 - known as reposici√≥n- rate was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed him to people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marry and form a family,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and parenthood, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to increase dramatically immigration to cope with the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> There are websites in Singapore where it abounds barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical to maintaining low wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year the party of government of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unintended consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to build as many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box&quot; that can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that can promote a style of life of people who remain unmarried and discourage developers who want to build big houses, relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are sold much faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, to talk with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the city centre, it seems that they are not going to have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, and it is also the education, so many people are putting off,&quot; says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, much as the government tries to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans are those who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The private off line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy is the quality of private or &quot;the scope of the private life that it has the right to protect any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for a child under the age of 16? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Do you understand the dangers to which it is exposed to air in Internet situations that surely not share out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> ElPeri√≥dico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, the term &quot;something very mine,&quot; on a personal level, and &quot;in the password and user name,&quot; when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;My deepest secrets are not up to a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when trying to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where has accounts from two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not the whole world,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In FB beautiful images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also entretengo with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I do not share a picture that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, of violent crimes or write or humiliating comments. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures the 35 FB friends and their nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Most are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if I answer, I just go,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He does not hesitate to answer that we will never accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Nor would someone who recommended him to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Joseph, 14, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admits not knowing to 20 of the people added to his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;I am not afraid, because we have something in common, the music, for example,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has hinted he has asked for the address of your home or your phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If I press and I simply demanded the sack of my account,&quot; acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jos√© became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The ciberbullying. Thanks it is known today experience than they&apos;s other is the not be boy </seg>
<seg id="2671"> An acquaintance of my friend were extorting in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;Never knew who he was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Joseph, not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;Only put privacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then explains a series of steps to configure the safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike George, this guy up photos of known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes I would, if I fall ill or you win. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> . Ciberbullying, &quot;declares that&apos;s know what and&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Batons notes that the academic Marc Prensky, master&apos;s degree in teaching at the Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrant, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They are digital natives, children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a definite judgment about what is or is not spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not to do that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They are also selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that will make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists some options: There are things that are not contar√≠as to a stranger, why you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, do you would like to publish a photo of yourself as you have made a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other published about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When labels photos of festivals, do you have requested permission to the other people to label them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more, do all they need to know what you&apos;re doing every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles must be equal in social networks,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Scots Guards, a university professor, a professor of primary and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents to read the policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> To understand each of the snippets of them have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guard, is key to remind children the lesson of &quot;do not talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without being made public the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven leaders assistants. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE tried repeatedly access to the document signed in the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry sources and the Presidency said at the outset that they were going to surrender after the closure, but later said that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> To be consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by Peru&apos;s president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;private session, audio restricted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the event, though not the Peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document released during the day was the list of attendees presidents, which caused the unease of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is Humala&apos;s pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In October last year, Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA, and on that occasion, despite being required by the press, nor was broadcast also called the Lima Declaration, which had previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> In the official website of Anna Lindh Foundation started can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international events, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to obtain information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court of The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that you will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which starts on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will abide by and run the ruling that defines the differences that today we are doing this international court,&quot; said Humala, together with his Chilean pair. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the treaties and international courts,&quot; he added Pi√±era, and greeted with a handshake Humala, along with the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that will be subject to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogot√° had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua who considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was conducted with absences from the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The trustee read the final document in which he reported that were adopted 16 agreements and set the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements mentioned that the countries of South American Nations (UNASUR will &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He reported that promote actions to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity and citizen against transnational organized crime, actions to make the drugs more accessible, access to the internet at a low price in all corners of South America, and to respond jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a crisis in Europe, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for their return to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Latin America&apos;s need to be maintained as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and for good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Saturday in Mexico to deal with in a way that respects the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to review all these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;With Ortega hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and friendly as possible,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would be on Saturday in Mexico, where they planned to attend the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, as part of the summit, the ministers of defense of the block previously met to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of Defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay in South American Nations (UNASUR, although the last country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot;South America, in this case, it must learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, the Peruvian state TV that &quot;Europeans were killed in the Second World War,&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship initiative to encourage the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We must get the free movement of citizens and workers for any country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian president was, moreover, in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The Chair would never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans signed everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States,&quot; said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that is not repented of that decision because it has betrayed its principles, but has respected their &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that, at the time, &quot;there was probable cause that Assange extradited to a third country and not be respected their process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, in addition to the Swedish justice for demand to be subjected to interrogation on their territory for an alleged sexual offence when &quot;the Swedish legislation allows you to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is the danger that their physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercise. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This complicates the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto that allows them to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, that word is not used in this case, but there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, los a√±os Garz√≥n, is making a series of procedures in different European bodies,&quot; he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And opined that &quot;if Britain gives the security clearance this morning was just.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as well as their legislation and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow will end this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and explained that it does not tolerate is &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, which infringe freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect welcomed that are no longer these journalists &quot;neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and the middle class that dominate in Ecuador,&quot; and said to be re-elected &quot;will deepen in the revolution to continue the way, and the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, to argue that the agency &quot;must be strong and not to tolerate the opportunism and coups d&apos;etat of legality,&quot; because in reality &quot;shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment does not abide by the ruling. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South American country and Central American one. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We must prosecute them comprehensively to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> It also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation by maritime boundaries that kept in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that &quot;it is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept failure by hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility that is presented as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term noted that sees that possibility, &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if it loses the election of February 2013 will retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> I was never interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be correct from political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My movement Montcada 6 believed that it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept this liability questions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Winning would be my last period in the presidency and then we go out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is a decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS deaths are now because of late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the positive outcome of the test: AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if I dropped a bomb,&quot; refers to relive the moment of the announcement that the doctor was trying to do more &quot;suavecito&quot; without apparent success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Decided to take charge of their disease, and began to learn about it; with such determination that already celebrated his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the start of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Until then, the director of a clinic the IMSS avoided farewell to him &quot;because it brought a cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome, and do so with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already wreaked havoc, &quot;&quot; exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, &quot;the great achievement means at this point that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV Unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infect√≥logo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement in the immune system that present patients to start the diagnosis, with the best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count, and 50 years ago, when 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple words, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive to the 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;while maintaining control can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; explained the interviewee. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For sizing this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> While the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national data base have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why deaths remains? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - A I think that it is not the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This view, this has happened to us in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because their state of infection, or, in the late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He gave a blunt fact: &quot;Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to make early diagnoses and, therefore, they have to provide evidence of detection of massive way, to all the people who need it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested to a particular laboratory, only motivated because I had made a friend, and despite their young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even suffered KS, a cancerous growth that is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are going to die, and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I&apos;m going to die, I better reviento three times a week,&quot; say no in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, I am good food, I exercise, I take the medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, only parents know that suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, as anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but the truth, I care to me and the other person,&quot; he enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> The test to be made, if they had more risk, which will soon know whether they are HIV-positive, it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, to learn that they can live as any person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> That, his message, sums up the theme of the AIDS battle this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Great are the gaps between the health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, Tapatio journalist who has taken up the cause in relation to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And it is the largest in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In those places dedicated to this task &quot;actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is all very well, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you want?&quot; Question is common, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, who did not want to expose the teenagers, assured the announcer. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Proposed to reorient this inefficient allocation; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in dispatchers public baths of the sites that frequent the young. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Neither is to pay the chelas and the motel, as he said the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez, to ask whether there would be distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It is not the sexuality, the best thing is to bring condoms to those who engage in sexual activity,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Keys in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 12,158 (cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is 4 ¬∞ national place in new cases of HIV and AIDS and 13 ¬∞. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the contagion corresponds to the sexually, 6% to the blood and 2 percent to the perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV as a registered case there are four to five people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a court of appeals from the United States a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Grupo Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a negative precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country which has solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures guarantee of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, against the grain of international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, leaving helpless to Mexican firms facing the possibility of its properties in beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> While the judge in the case noted that creditors should be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the appeals court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial competition processed in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would ignore the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trans-national profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Indeed, towards this end was created the UN Model Law for the Distribution Uniformity of the International Commercial Law, acting as an arbitrator the American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the sentence establishes that without the vote intercompa√±√≠as, recognized in the critical mass of the contest commercial debts that they had with its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had not been achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the possibility they recognize Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which it accepts the scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompa√±√≠as endorsed the Federal Institute of Mercantiles contests. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is true that the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, that is to say &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The data omit the court of appeals. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> From another angle, he blames the difficult situation that faced from 2008 to askance at the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, the barbs blows to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> Meanwhile, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family is appealing for reconsideration before the appeals court for the vote, i.e. the five judges, given that only three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> This is not prosper claim the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> What is serious is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the law of contests Mercantiles, pointing out that this case involving with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to match it with the Chapter 15 of the Act of bankruptcies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Moreover, it is pointed out that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Two bands: He smacked Vitro and stick to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> Balance Sheet </seg>

<seg id="2852"> The funds would be channeled to the purchase of shares in the Professional Administrator of Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As you know, Azc√°rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> Surround the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The end of the week in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Dragon Mart Chinese in Canc√∫n. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> We are talking, as you know, a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country&apos;s products of the wall, with an area of the home match for employees of 150 companies. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;Hetin Reyes:&quot; Basketball has been my life &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Globe-trotting basketball Hector &quot;Hetin Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he traveled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as broad as the &quot;Hetin&quot; is Hector Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And that is before a stroke it would to a wheel chair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of lesser categories, the National Basketball player, attorney and leader in the BSN with Gorchakov of Bayam√≥n, president of the Federation of Basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s,&quot; Reyes recalled during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayam√≥n, where lies with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes not exaggerate to make such a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias that denote his wide experience, as well. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayam√≥n in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> All of them, with the greatest excitement are those who recall their passage through the Vaqueros since mid-50 as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Gorchakov championships since 1967, whether as attorney, coapoderado or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Many years of satisfaction, including the five championships shifted from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Thereafter took charge &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great manager, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had headed here and I was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player, 6 &apos;7&quot; tall. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse enjoyed, but to the distance, since 1988 to already included federal supremo. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> This time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when he won for the first time to the United States during the Olympic in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and should have been bronze Canadian referee that made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Does this group of the 1990 World Cup is the best National Team that you&apos;ve seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is among the best, like the one that won him the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave him a team of the United States, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This&apos; well Fico Ramon Rivas, staff Picul√≠n not be &apos;, just, it peddled Ort√≠z together Mincy, in its Spanish initials &quot;and Gausse younger Carter but rather James, and To√±ito&quot; Columbus for a as well the did brother with Leon, (Javier couldn has, not to Francesco being y according Morales &quot;through Don Quijote voice&quot; Edgar for with and another Universidad knee. The injuries in one because of 90 </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995&apos;s Olympic in Neuqu√©n, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Paul Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the suspended players for the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, won gold against all the odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What has been the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, that has been Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level, as it did Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that without his career in the different leagues that played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Young people, I love the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What you think your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN took up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that he had wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, the boys of Ponce only play in your area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the children travel and play far too unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruit of the certifications compulsorias and course for leaders, officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> I am pleased about that. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> What I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the religion professor Stuart charm√© decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;long countdown&quot; of the Mayan Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have clung as proof that it is the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But charm√© had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot;deudarmaged√≥n&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time believe that will start the Apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there has been,&quot; said charm√© this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If one looks at what has been happening in the world today, as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not only a teacher who offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory, the last of the story. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple, the adjunct professor Barry vacker is teaching the course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>

<seg id="2975"> &quot;Do not add &apos;2012&apos; to count with the option to teach the course again, in the event that the world is not an end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;imminent ruin,&quot; students should study, generate projects and to take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no other option than to work &quot;until the same night that the world is supposed to end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was saturated in two hours,&quot; said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Received by e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, of people who asked if he had still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>

<seg id="2983"> And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it. </seg>

<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project discussed the Mayan prophecy and desacreditamos in a certain way,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a student of last year in Temple, 21, of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes around predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;Elsewhere, people do not think about this,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines are not involved in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years, there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing is going on December 21, &quot;people start to think immediately on the next date&quot; or to philosophize on 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said they intend to go to parties, &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe call some friends to riamos together,&quot; said Samira Ford, a student of 20 years. </seg>
