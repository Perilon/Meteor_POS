<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Centre Brennan sees it as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified as 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments from 2009 passed new laws making it more difficult for the registration process or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new Republican officials in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of polls, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and withdraw to citizens with a criminal record their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican authorities clamoured to extend the practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike the Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such an identity document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students, voters considered voting for candidates more Democrats, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Prior to 2004, no state requires proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing registration of voters on polling day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns have helped to save about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have driven down by 17% rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same was true with Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, the whites who accounted for 76% of voters represented only 46% of the electorate voting in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the Democratic governors vetoes. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to get tested. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to have firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one, found a difference in mortality among patients who were screened and those who do not have. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastasis if it is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The African-American men are also at greater risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others who are feeble. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to understand the degree of risk to the patient&apos;s cancer, by offering options, does not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect the long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will suggest to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will give them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it is precisely the criteria to decide who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend still to pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether or not it should pass. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>

<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no easy way to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles, remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If nobody smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; says Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many also remain totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is highly detrimental to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer fell by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommends to reduce consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too much, it raises the risk of developing colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The deli meats, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, are not conclusive yet. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;A screening test, it does not give cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson husked </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson likely has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Indeed, it is believed that the boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;least worst&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data released this week at a major conference of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be absolutely sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose all the same whether the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law fatally unavoidable that two things cannot find themselves in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to violate this rule - and don&apos;t try too hard, you&apos;re going to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="114"> However, even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, has a law like this: The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - the state &quot;consisting of roughly in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the particle physicists fall into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: The mesons, which we do not discuss here, and &quot;forcibly particles,&quot; by which the major forces of nature and spread the Higgs boson is somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all bugs as exotic as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson an extraordinary banality: The photon, or particle of light &quot;,&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this &quot;disturbing&quot; the electromagnetic field in this specific location, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus a boson &quot;with force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same is true with the Higgs boson, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; that the boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; pour l&apos;exciter, we must be very, very high energies, just as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock could ride the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator at CERN - like the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 miles in circumference! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> These are not all particles, and all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like the magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, would never take place itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what is &quot;can make&quot; all of this research, asked Senator Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any difference between the observations and predictions of the MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also more fervently hope that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes in the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which form about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But it has not found such differences at CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact, </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research in the daily lives of Mr. or Ms.-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Consider: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in the Bell Laboratories, do not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw the scientific applications, but nothing of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first laser (the first was continuous pulsed), in 1962, the laser was initially seen as a &quot;gadget lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, during its work in perspective. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not at all its original intent, now serves as &quot;eye&quot; in digital cameras all around the world, and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his Commission die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will resume shortly after a bill is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this vital area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to look more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Mont√©r√©gie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer who gnawed had left a respite from two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago,&quot; he says, half-mixed, lying in his bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s still a shock, it may not be prepared for it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is his work: A huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even to eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to get help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him, give him his medication, offered him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I will cure diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing piss,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept the regression, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are at the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who enter the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life up to three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called curative care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die &quot;conscious and stifled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer wish in life,&quot; she says, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It looked all the same, in the next few days, a last visit to his son come to Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Victor-Gadbois, it provides, together with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are palliative care, which is when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make their lives more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, there are a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when we know that eventually you die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life goes under the best possible conditions, &quot;explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> At the level of comfort of physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> In the dying, it will provide care at the mouth of brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of daily life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night, it has served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who will complete beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It helps the relatives as much as patients,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At home, Victor-Gadbois, two days but do not resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Alongside a 93-year-old man who is relishing his last meeting of family in the yard, well cushioned in pillows while it is falling in his honor, a 36-year-old man has died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Over the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and home palliative care Society of Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in the Quebec health care that is feared to several doctors who specialize in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, signed a manifesto of palliative care luminaries including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before agreeing to perform euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without the necessary to relieve her. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncologist that I would have to stop treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop to beat me, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Yet, she had told me that I was finished! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients who ask to die thanked caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home palliative care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors have often use palliative sedation, which amounts to sedate the patient until the time of his death, or a sporadic or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want you euthanasiiez me,&quot; it means &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this story was made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Road officials, contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian Mafia experts tell day after day what they know a formidable &quot;system,&quot; mixing the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry&quot; that was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It&apos;s funny how the system crumbles since he took the major means&quot;, &quot;Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former Chief of Police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through a background investigation on embezzlement related to road construction contracts in Quebec, in which the Liberal premier, Jean Charest, did so only begrudgingly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;The report Duchesneau was a direct link between industry, financial underpinnings of parties and corruption of public officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he noted, the Department of Transportation alone could have saved $1 billion on contracts,&quot; some r√©fr√©nant their instincts to reach a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he says, in the hope that it gets to &quot;demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The ongoing anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts across the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> &quot;More police officers of the squad Marteau&quot; which, since 2009, would have led the &quot;Montreal&quot; cartel sewers to apply the brake on the swelling of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has conducted searches in series and laid charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, as Frank Zampino a d√©clar√© and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who comes to resign from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of having pocketed bribes of repeatedly in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Moreover, are formally accused of the Montreal Road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> It caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait money at Union Montreal, the party of Mayor G√©rald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He confessed to organizing an illegal fund-raising for the Former Deputy Prime Minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts which he inflated costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was functioning smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, has detailed well before the committee: In 10 years, he has received from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736 million in exchange for sewer contracts which he exaggerated the costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other road officials have confessed to having grease the leg by pumping up 30% to 40% invoices, false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding its coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, east of the island, she said in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, she said that she &quot;draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and nabbing wrongdoers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> It is about to clean the wound but there should be a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, not to see the return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but expressed particular concern about the role of &quot;elected officials aware of the scheme,&quot; when they don&apos;t soaking in deception! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Believing at 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government is proposing to limit to $100 donations to parties, but this will not change the situation, he said: &quot;As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be of dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: &quot;You can&apos;t go lower, and get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on a firmer footing, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story has tarnished the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own back yard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progression? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I was at their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also contributed a great deal to me. </seg>
<seg id="257"> On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the match, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not catch fire. </seg>
<seg id="261"> In my early days at the centre of training of the INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by levels. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Therefore, you are taking advantage of competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer&apos;s recruits are accustomed to play games of a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The fact that a player like me want to respond and to provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has great experience and has won a lot of titles with exclusive clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will win other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a comforting discussion with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I went out of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> It gives me confidence also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> How do you see on the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarter-finals with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to finish first in our pool, ahead of Porto, in order to receive final at the 8th of return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> PSG can become a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It has already the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and long-lasting. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, PSG gives itself the means to make this project happen. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it was really committed to pocket the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it is not gone far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because it had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It made a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Was finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you believe that the media are waiting too much? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that you expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It accepts it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to blame us, it is certain that it is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> You can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We&apos;re trying to put in place a game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was shown in the Champions League that it could be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the quarter-finals, they have also made huge expenses! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the money invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead at the truce. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were inspired by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevailed. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic exploits. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better we say that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It is time for that and it proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He has demonstrated wherever he went he was a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, it respects the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you lived the Euro 2012 with the French team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had committed to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to scrape together game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and I am emerged stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I can achieve good matches selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped since my baptism with the Blues. </seg>
<seg id="336"> It was learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we are now needs to have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How do you see on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of hockey? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I don&apos;t want to make comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had achieved its goal in qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good one (1-1), on 16 October, Spain is a founding game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each has fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and processing costs among stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, led to the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol to the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course of the bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She described as &quot;the virtual currency bitcoin with the most success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as &quot;credits&quot; used to move forward in a video game is won by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes share in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But each time, a central authority control and trade deals. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that traded bitcoins do exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a hash phase of file, i.e. transformation of a large file into a single digital footprint and shorter. </seg>
<seg id="372"> &quot;Computers are&quot; the new transaction and add a number of &quot;chop&quot; before the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that gives a special imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number found, the other nodes easily check that this is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have different fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until one hundred millionth, leaving room... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Life of the network has already had its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company to pay real money by using the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also identifies opportunities for money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash also has this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Serious players such as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not run. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;giants&quot; balances have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but he uses to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier operates over its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new software or terminals. </seg>
<seg id="395"> All they need to provide an address, a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in his report, intended to reassess the risks, now considered high, in the event of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We started from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished by treating them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as during Soviet times. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will not be when Westerners will be more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops of the Nijrab base, which I watched from the hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and armoured joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country ablaze because of the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, current Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They became wheeler-dealers, seizing of government land for resale in building land to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, running huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are stigmatized; most of them have not fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: Capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, government schools are full, girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will provide work for these young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its Turkish soap operas that have a modern world is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities that the order will be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already rebuilding of provincial militias, which will escape the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to enjoy a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform it into a centralised state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country has, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been restarted, there is no dam, no major irrigation system can be repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the sense that Westerners were only there to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat iron ore and copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the My Afghanistan&apos;s huge Aynak Copper Mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) searched the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will take one day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of the French troops ended on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: High school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the Archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of &quot;civil-military actions&quot; by the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), deleted in 2012, led, and carry out by a small French NGO, many public works and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, intensive local workforce, were able to help contain the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase crop acreage. </seg>
<seg id="447"> That will leave us as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of local, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To break free of the insurgency waged by foreign groups, such as farmers have told me wish, it should be kept in their favor a small civilian assistance, well-controlled and that directly affects them. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A Constitution the forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him temporarily full powers, he decided to play everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two months in this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> For almost two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text amended several times which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, he persevered in his &quot;autocratic style,&quot; continuing to &quot;betraying its word&quot; and &quot;trampling the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a means to an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to abandon their plans to explain the text article by article, Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain a popular legitimacy and democratic, while the dispute raged across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> As the use of a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers,&quot; they would supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals were missing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they have not been able to express their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="469"> To ensure that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, substitute members, have been added in haste, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators have also amused by the fact that one of the only difference of the day has spoken around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was misadjusted. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, includes 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects from all sides, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stating that &quot;the principles of sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace &quot;principles&quot; by &quot;the rules,&quot; which would have allowed stricter enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; replied the liberals, who see only a stroke of communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They are, in particular Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University in an advisory role, particularly with regard to check the conformity of laws with sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because &quot;people called to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> The fears of Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;For the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the state. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some trained in the French system &quot;moderates Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he acknowledges that &quot;there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrowed religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> It refers to the &quot;fiqh&quot; including [Islamic jurisprudence, ed]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question could arise in the future to what extent of civilian judges are competent to rule on it. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is widely criticized because of the powers it grants the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another contentious point: The powers granted to the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Defence Council. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Nor will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="494"> They are also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem liberticidal. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, freedom of the press in particular. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Moreover, there is no longer echo the protection of women, &quot;said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="497"> According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. </seg>
<seg id="498"> The word was not included in the previous Constitution. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;Language has, in Moscow will&quot;: Migrants save money to learn the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPs and human rights activists pol√©miquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling &quot;false&quot; certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only purpose: To earn money to support their families at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December, a law came into force, and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and retail. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, over time, promised the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Moreover, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law. </seg>
<seg id="595"> We will have to validate its language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Are free only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> People with teaching certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of test centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of friendship of peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other institutions of higher education in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in cities across the country: More than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce exams was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: What is it will give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, met representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering &quot;of slavery at work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, &quot;says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organized will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without an understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of assisting, will provide a &quot;trip&quot; in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of others are tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and toiling between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected wage,&quot; confirms the head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I don&apos;t argue, the policeman! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia said they did not know not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it is not their fault, but their misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to take even a fair primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when you don&apos;t know the language, they entrust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel diminished and undermined.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> Defenders of human rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law on the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The reviews will be intended solely to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there will be no review or formal work thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome to enter&quot; or defence </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explained that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Moreover, the legalization costs money: Between 12 and 16 miles rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, you can get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Russian police officers know that we have forged documents, that we do not have to register, where cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; said to reporters Umed Khouchkadamov, a national of Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Do quickly, without skimping and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> On the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the migrants&apos; registration papers were not the only ones to be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several false certificates of language exams have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The falsified papers out of a colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: It will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Representatives of power and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the test for the first time for language training. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of the Interior is not the arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen the law against the civilian weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: Whether fire at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Police wants to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the permit to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who has promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced at the State Duma soon. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;tightening the screw.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, demand to abandon &quot;this senseless hardening.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, &quot;said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of laws concerning civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from gaining access to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> According to them, you can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From the factory to the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of weapons is provided via several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are five, &quot;says Viktor Baranets, retired army colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot from a site taking orders of weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is the &quot;military record,&quot; i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,&quot; said Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the police. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen from the police stocks as those stolen directly to representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal guns go on sale since the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of them have often suffered explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Certified versions indicate that some of the fires were started deliberately to hide the deficit,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="663"> To Baranets, arms manufacturers are there for a reason. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;You see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,&quot; says one expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> A significant part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia was formed and organizes the supply,&quot; said the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where the weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for problem analysis and study for public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data portals relating to weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explained, comes from the army and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the weapons on the black market was found &quot;by lack of employees whose work is related to weapons,&quot; said in the report. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from &quot;clandestine excavations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="675"> A vendor and an armoury consultant who asked to remain anonymous ensures that long ago nobody buys weapons found by these specialists from illegal searches; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he said, sellers will look for new military goods in warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys through a teaches a unit, for example a TT pistol. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The book on him in passing the goods by a screen. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;It is in the city and sells it for 900 ‚Ç¨per unit with two magazines,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is true that the police are aware of all business, so when crimes are about to be clarified, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers,&quot; adds the seller. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a luxury boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer are generally through knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I consulted sites, blogs, until a type manifests itself and proposes to come to the station of Begovaya where someone was becoming &quot;take me in a corner&quot; to bargain. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the gun, I was given on-site </seg>
<seg id="685"> Viktor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To find a gun, it is necessary that I know someone who has a contact, &quot;says the seller. I know someone, but I don&apos;t trust it. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come in saying, for example, &quot;From the part of this person, who asked me to convey that her daughter has lost a tooth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy a pair of American fists with a person to whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> I am the only book to me because he knows that I do not give it. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The new looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Patterns, according to him, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given a photo album in which there was &quot;anything you want.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I thought I was in a luxury boutique,&quot; remembers the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is no secret to the buyer, &quot;said Baranets, you can try anything. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As a potential customer, I am not content to buy, it goes with the seller in the forest and installing a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They let me take and when I am convinced that the gun works well, it begins to negotiate,&quot; describes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A shop since his </seg>
<seg id="699"> Search engines are the sites and groups on every where you can buy weapons &quot;for different uses.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="700"> For this reason, it does not need any document and person to meet. </seg>

<seg id="722"> United States: Employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier&apos;s job at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against low wages by famous Walmart supermarkets and fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or diminish quickly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest wage increases that workers receive basic at Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when a flood of rain balances seizing million has befallen America and sometimes triggering clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people have left their posts to organize picket lines with trade unions and left-wing activists in stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles, car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many low-paid workers at Walmart shop solely on their place of work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of products made from Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap in part because of low wages of its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants of the events of the &quot;Black Friday&quot; asked for a salary increase, they have complained that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the employee base at Walmart affecting $9.5 per hour, that is a sum that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1.1% more than it currently spends. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred any wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would be tantamount to 46 cents. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and has borne no harm to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in stores from 8: 00 in the evening at midnight the following day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> His funds made a total of 100 million transactions for the &quot;Black Friday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the site of the left Huffington Post that &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a &quot;outsell operation among many&quot; by the union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Next customer!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests have continued this week in New York and were no longer Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announcement sell billions of servings and after they did not even give you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council of </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage under federal law and New York is $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food outlets the increase with time, but little, an average of its employees in New York are $8.90 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody is less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this amount in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald&apos;s after high school while living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself to interview McDonald&apos;s employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don&apos;t know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and the fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also sought to be established trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration rarely simplifies their life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the key is the extraordinary staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They are not agree </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s announcement sell billions of portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and don&apos;t pay the work you have done honestly!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we must all support the employees of the fast food so they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times characterized this event as the most important in the fast-food sector throughout its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people participated and that not all were employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> For the moment, it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the moment, it is only moderately to deceive the brain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Recently, fans of the new technologies have become accustomed to collect the augmented reality through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Initially, it is Google, which unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference in November, it was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it appears from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technology Microsoft&apos;s lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, through the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Could you tell us in a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Humanity as a whole remained at the moment to the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes touch. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What we also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on 3D imaging systems truly operating on different technologies, including the projection technology. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need to move the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> To begin with, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think of the voice commands? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but is it not overstated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> We cannot say that this is a panacea: The issue of confidentiality arises because it has not always want to tell others about his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discrete gestures, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by a joint command, for example: Gesture + votes. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - It is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how would you ask me to miss this can? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would with the floor and with gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually, I spoke only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to force users to adjust depending on what the machine may or may not do at any given time? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I believe that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and that is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If there is interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you do not like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack of resolution, deep or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get about 8-megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c / s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the cameras themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds work to designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> We must bear in mind the resolution X and Y and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is also very much, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c / o does not really enough, especially for those actions. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond has given to the touch sensors regular delayed treatment between 1 and 100 ¬µs, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everyone does not understand how it influences the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would have needed a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, for having more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But is it not increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third is in fact a sensor camera usual of the field visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="824"> A lot of cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the volume required of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, playing with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but here&apos;s what I think: The best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality that you would from a cloud platform to spend glasses in the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal and that makes their strength (personal items are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: The augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea pointing the finger: There is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands don&apos;t feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepare in relation to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my classes, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a basis for image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is perfectly pressures! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign the palpability these images &quot;in the air&quot;: For example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed at a specific point the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breath of air on the fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the bracelets worn on the wrist that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to mislead the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him believe that he feels it should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task here below on which it will take a long time to have difficulty: How to believe in someone who is physically located in a very small space that it works in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, it is only moderately to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: A lot of things are still in a state of fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;The Petersburg avant-garde&quot; dedicated to city dwellers who find themselves in advance, at the forefront of culture and the arts. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This ultra-selective list has already hosted leading actors in the art scene in Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new heroes of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, dressed in red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden and parties and openings connected. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller always bring crowds, regardless of their place of exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the storytellers St. Petersburg fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the avant-garde distance of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and puts them in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it has become a symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of its existence, his philosophy and his bohemian image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why do you run the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the red as fashion designer specializing in appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, anything that is not grey is aggressiveness and a negative unrest. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are intended to start the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - At the exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that it was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of unofficial painters had grown old and new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started my friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then there has been no wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took took place at Pushkinskaya-10 home before the work a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I can still see Chnour arrive with the project &quot;The Van Gogh&apos;s ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang songs easy during playback in tight shirts, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer fashionable today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to happen live, it became &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg inspired quite emissions before the time of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is here that he received them. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Su &quot;D137,&quot; &quot;Griboedov Club&quot;: These are the impact of the artistic Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are parties as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, the time when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: It was the price &quot;The personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I was appointed &quot;Painter of the year,&quot; and it was then that my reign ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currency and acute. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibit &quot;The Russian museum across the clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a class timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it&apos;s scary to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the total disguise and mandatory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress that is important, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Perhaps you can&apos;t give him a hand, but rather that it takes up to the mug. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be deleted by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this kind of heroes. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet wine. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of the culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian liked one thing, corny another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, we need to think about who you&apos;re going. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But many thousands of people come to see Stas Mikha√Ølov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - These are people that have been laid to come see it, it is the social and sexual side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it is less management, money, everything is dying. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung alongside Falk or Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the tables that usually are those that are painted in end-of-life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, it is often confused ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: There are spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money for painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - A good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: The official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not everyone can work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of good tsars, it was not like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there is now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will evaluate correctly these experts and pave a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste,&quot; which blooms. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what is it is St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is far more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art is struggling to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil and we have more writers and readers, it&apos;s bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of curious that will see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, this is a very thin layer. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make the fashionable art as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>

<seg id="932"> Birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or deadly asteroid collision. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings aboard go in search of a planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a big question arises: How to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a planet relief? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two true planets that can win, if only by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;This is Venus and Mars,&quot; said Vladimir mute, a researcher at the Institute of State astronomical P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If the conditions on Mars are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is $500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can&apos;t live at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It has begun to focus on issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a half-century, it was conducting experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit were in no way of earth varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Secondly, it was put into orbit insects, small flies breeding fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get to exit a chick perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems start. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is linked to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must be put on its legs and start moving,&quot; explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir air. </seg>
<seg id="950"> As there is no support, the chicks flapping disorderly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 p.m., the new born saw their fully atrophying instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks did not respond to the light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they died just after four days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We now offer our eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; said Vladimir air by noting the failure of past experience with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last &quot;organic&quot; miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; spacecraft will carry that species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it has discovered nothing supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience. We must do this kind of research,&quot; said Vladimir air. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, it does not yet to make reproductions directly into space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, the man is capable, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional substance. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women are in space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity&apos;s most precious asset. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The gull flew and person on Earth could not say whether it would hold after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody responded to this issue,&quot; said Vakhtang Vatchnadz√©, retired sector rockets and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and have even worked in extra-vehicular, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit,&quot; concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia&apos;s hero, Valery Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Centre for Hydrology laboratory preparation cosmonauts: Mandatory step in preparing for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in neutral buoyancy, cosmonauts train to extra-vehicular exits. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, the water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious men seem to confirm this: Life on Earth is from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> To the extent that the baby is about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid in the womb, it is easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical, because since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little to forget,&quot; explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if the child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman is in need of gravity, a force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> OK, do not know it based on birth simulators. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course, you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then?&quot; Asks Valery Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the earth&apos;s attraction, the agency does not form the skeleton nor the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> You can&apos;t dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of their basic needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully d√©sadapt√©,&quot; provides the Director of the Committee on Bioethics Institute of medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in space is still the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time it will become a reality, when the Enterprise will visit their shuttles to a distant planet, which will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) said: &quot;The control of the pseudo self-employment (in Czech&quot; ≈†varc system &quot;) has failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This is what said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking here,&quot; said Kala in his commentary on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Control conducted jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the &quot;system&quot; by Petr Neƒças ≈†varc. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls; is allowed or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect to demand respect for the law,&quot; said Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the monitoring committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a Czech-German project in which were compared the legislation on public procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it really matter? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public procurement and specific national laws and an actual practice to follow. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have gathered all of this, and although this monitoring procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences we have emerged: Generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps more severe &quot;and better quality,&quot; however, according to certain parameters, such as the practice is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can this project help you in practice and that result is there for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type should help us strive to clarify the laws, to decline and improve the thresholds, when it was not really a positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good governance means getting the thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering the thresholds of markets, it does not necessarily reach that goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find a lot more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In terms of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions are basically in a similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also has over the accounts of this kind at the level of individual L√§nder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Bank can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Our public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the L√§nder accounts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to national legislation, is it easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it surely cannot say that it is better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> No, definitely not, but I repeat, I don&apos;t have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it is also true that this country that we see as a model is also facing a series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have no incentive to cooperate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our operations. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we make a posteriori controls, we must reckon with a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our comments relate only, for the time being, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument &quot;to detect risks of mismanagement&quot; with which we have scrutinized nearly 14,000 public contracts - that these changes will be felt, of course, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of some types of tender procedures and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> So what do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an extra load for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the future will confirm this. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can happen is that these rules will become more severe, and that it is not possible to meet them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not that way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put more pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> So what is the solution to get by? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look at where we are not going. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with control of the so-called ≈†varc system - what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system is ≈†varc prohibited or authorized? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and demand respect for the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He may declare: &quot;We are going to change the law and authorize it,&quot; but he could not say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only for cause of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are frozen in places, but most were still passable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network, however, remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Karlovy Vary region </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were passable this morning, but also in places frozen and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Temperatures dropped and oscillate between -5 ¬∞ C and -10 ¬∞ C, but they are expected to increase slightly in the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The snowfall stopped in the region and it remains in the plains that a thin layer of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The crests of Kru≈°n√© hory (Ore Mountains), however, are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> According to data from the regional service road maintenance because of the fog, visibility was reduced in some places. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The fast lane R6 and national roads in the region are now passable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Vigilance remains to be made, for example on some bridges with the coating can be frozen and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All roads and pathways of third category, including mountain roads, are also feasible. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> There is still some of their segments of the remains of frozen snow-packed in some places and traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in areas at high altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Pardubice regions and Hradec Kr√°lov√© </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The Directorate of roads and motorways said on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers of compacted by traffic can be found on the roads in mountainous areas and located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan≈°kroun, √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠, Poliƒçka, Svitavy or Vysok√© M ‚Äé ‚Äé √Ωto, largely on the roads and third category. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkono≈°e) and the Monts de l&apos;Aigle (Orlick√© hory). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> In the districts of Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou and Trutnov, a layer of snow-packed traffic is present on the roads in upland areas. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> In East Bohemia, the time will be dry today, most often identified with potential cloudy. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> It will blow a low wind and temperatures typically range between -3 ¬∞ and + 1 ¬∞ C. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Of Pilsen region </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Roads in the region of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise increased vigilance and adjust to weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ¬∞ and -9 ¬∞ C. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After the last snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen in some places. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, visibility improves gradually, however. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> This is what it appears from the information of the regional service road maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The motorway is passable almost without difficulties, maintenance services of road communications recommends, however, increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and Tachov district. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Departmental channels and third category are moist and applies in this case the warning against the frozen sections. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Drivers must be vigilant, and particularly on less-travelled roads in the region of the ≈†umava. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Of Olomouc region </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Drivers travelling in areas of the Olomouc region located in altitude must now reckon with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> This layer remained on the collar said &quot;ƒåervenohorsk√© sedlo&quot; and on the road in the direction of Videlsk√Ω k≈ô√≠≈æ, after the chemical processing operations. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The snowfall forced this night road maintenance personnel to visit on the ground; according to the services in charge of roads, it has fallen more than three centimeters in the district of ≈†umperk. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> &quot;On the heights of the District of ≈†umperk remnants of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Truck drivers Jesen√≠k should expect to Col said &quot;ƒåervenohorsk√© sedlo&quot; deep snow and soft, &quot;said today in √àTK Chief District road maintenance ≈†umperk. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Their colleagues in the district Jesen√≠k also visited on site during the night, according to the latter, after chemical treatment, roads, are now identified and wet, even in the most high. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> In the district of Olomouc roads are passable without difficulty, in the district of ≈†ternberk drivers should, however, be careful in the sections in forest areas to wet pavement remained. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Regions of √öst√≠ nad Labem and Liberec </seg>
<seg id="1098"> As of this morning, road maintenance of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> According to data from the police, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn√≠nice na √östecku is closed. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Temperatures will remain below zero in lower elevations and snow and freezing rain should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem, and roads are generally dry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> No difficulty of movement was reported at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> The road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around ≈†tƒõt√≠. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for his training: Rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> There are also reports, since the main roads, difficult conditions on National Route 13 on the border between the regions of √öst√≠ nad Labem and Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The closure of the movement between Telnice and Kn√≠nice is due to branches of trees that were bent under the weight of snow up to reach the road. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> ≈†imon Ornest said: &quot;In concert, we want to collect the positive energy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month that should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, rather it laughs and says that we are the only group capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In addition, you go up in December a unique project: Three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you provide more details of this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity work that we are preparing for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end almost at a time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, one time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to together, with the public, reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys from the end of the world, buying online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other performers has also recorded a hymn to the end of the world, which is titled &quot;End of the world canceled&quot; (in Czech &quot;Konec svƒõta zru≈°eno&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, it also will hear at these charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has no place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Also joining the hymns at some point in a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The song&apos;s lyrics were written by Tom√°≈° Han√°k which also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sang... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How do you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We are working with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, owing to the fact that we have many concerts and charitable events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to engage intensively on these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it&apos;s fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will be done with the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to persons with reduced mobility and which we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedliƒçka, with the association Tap, and it for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly visit with students of the institute Jedliƒçk≈Øv and propose activities that interest them and fun. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we are trying to assist them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the framework of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedliƒçka, we will transfer this project in a new building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several music groups and performers will at each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria, have you the chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all ages, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will Chinaski, Support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Prepare yourself to other &quot;mega-events&quot; of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here, too, we will prepare a quality program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I&apos;d like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Haitian Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not so terrible that it looks at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in electric wheelchair which must travel in bunker gear, of course we trimbalons also a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything has more or less consistently well past, CSA and British Airways were always fully prepared for us, I was surprised more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards persons with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What were your experiences until now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Moscow to the east all is still in an initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very few accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet known person travelling alone in electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet see as evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there also, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Why do we have to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things for which we are still lagging... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet at the museum, anywhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> This is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are quite on the contrary to the cutting edge! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and famous lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedliƒçka, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I myself am musician (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, over time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç said, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success came only in recent years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> This is true, the failure to create links with singers and work actively to the promotion of the group helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Had you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The show business is full of tips that mimic each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a way, it is logical: Everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Few of the original projects, and I dare say that Haitian Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be firm in many areas and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> One, L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group open, people come and go, we can do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want to or would want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in the Incheba arena in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in Fl√©da Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Later in the evening, the three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when will be jointly sung the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources ($25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training center located in Prague in the institute Jedliƒçka. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the ensuing years has participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road from Poland into space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they do not always meet understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> For example, I would like to mention the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book entitled &quot;Introduction to astronautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later ≈†ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski became interested in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, ≈†ternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his book &quot;Introduction to astronautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a big propagator of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published hundreds of articles in newspapers Polish and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics of world renown, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> As early as 1925 was built in Poland railway intended to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, there is neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or curb railway. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known about this railway are those of the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was conducted by the institute Kom√≥rka en Automobielbedrijf Tromp Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the documents kept that this research had reached the stage of testing. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book &quot;Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects were directed military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all plans to use the technique of rockets were carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee (&quot;provisional TYMCZASOWY Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), who coordinated all work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November issue of the journal Problem 1954, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He retained his position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the ATP brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had an 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built an improved version, RM-1A and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket had a length of 1.4m and weighed probably 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The prototype after ought to be able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket RM-34 ought to have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind aloft. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all development work was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 per litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was $0.34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland at the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also been involved in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim√≠r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has raised in the public opinion a heated discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means that the different economic entities, as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the free movement (unlimited) of private capital ally to a rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The huge differences in the price of labour (wages) generate tension on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It should be put under this term the following meaning: A producer tries by the importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in &quot;making it more expensive,&quot; the price of a competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: Either transferring production abroad, or buy cheap or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high in comparison to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-√†-vis the unemployment that it generates social charges of the State necessarily increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of Messrs. contractors to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society in the race for profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the different economies create a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This occurs mainly in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to compel economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This happens partly by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and the restriction of the rights of workers in the field of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and deepening of differences between the rich and the poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are for years points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already by million the number of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for employees receive such salaries that the State is obliged to pay a premium to reach the minimum subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The cost-saving measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU are, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to eke out with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here we need to ask the question: Where will this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media claim to have enough of it, that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the command economy led to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital is very much in the idea that the state may not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The question then becomes whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not run today, according to its own selfish interests, politics, and by the same, the entire state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is certainly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby and present in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely tied to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The entire power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitutions but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The State had long been deteriorating and functions were assigned by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of bribes, favors received illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The kickbacks and corruption were spreading without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold... &quot;...&quot; The honest people do not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State was 8 months without consuls... &quot;&apos;It really began to say that the cure for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he had to choose an energetic man...&quot; It is true that Pompey Appianos had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, today&apos;s society is based on the preference of the personal benefit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to advance the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the current state of affairs, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies such as some sort of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the social and humanitarian crises that we are now witnesses as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by recent and ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is subject to socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will never end violence and never will,&quot; says Sting in the song called Fragile whose main towards the refrain is &quot;let us not forget how much we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my son did not want war, there would be no,&quot; said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some take advantage of Israel, citing its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its recurrent waves of killings; after all, the current population of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a point of view located &quot;behind the curtain,&quot; in which benefit mainly on the lingering tensions already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these ideas are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerged from my own understanding of it, or more accurately the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they were to their actions to the throne to someone who led their acts on the basis of pre-defined objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this financial concentration causing some powers could not be done in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families with an astronomical wealth from the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader, but I do not rule out). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Since the 1990s in the 19th century, they have acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and who had always meant for them to strengthen their power, an increase in their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in most of the world&apos;s central banks and prepare or conducting wars against the countries in which they have not yet of such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America of the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I fully understand) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to emit clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF to have triggered the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power at the global level has resulted in 1859 in 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including British, and the third is expected to reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order in the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent are not repeated crises such as those that they produced in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg throne, they destroyed Czarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier outbreak of World War II, bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: They have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany&apos;s enormous war reparations creating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is to hold a strong enough leader, pointing the finger, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she was actually) fifth column to light the touchpaper and trigger a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially; or if everything he did was planned, the fact remains that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire that could cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers can trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the second world war, the first casualty of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or Muslim population generally of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level, it is enough to see how people bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of violence and where there is at the root of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power in the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we must make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers do not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascisant politician, loyal to international bankers, who is trying to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) spread to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which currently handles 20% of the entire global oil (naval corridor has a width of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In what light now appear the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn is set up at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;They are forcing all individuals, big and small, rich and poor, free and to focus on the hand and the forehead costs, so that he can neither buy nor sell the one that does not bear the name of this wild beast, or the number of his name. </seg>

<seg id="1334"> This is the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: When things are going badly wrong, call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of Islamist students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in effect, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to obtain the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, shot even worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to rescue hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following negotiations held by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate in the United States provoked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After twists complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a whirlwind coverage: They left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew came to locations for the shooting of a film with great spectacle of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of gender </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines were state of this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were long secret, the film is based on the recollections of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film is an unusual combination of Affleck of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of a successful coup, treachery - such as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&apos;s eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Successive moods: Sequences of Tehran in the documentary-style (subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were recorded in the film, there is no great differences) </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with men dressed discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and acting ceased to be ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third feature film after the dark policeman &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film Affleck who does not take place in his home city of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The meaning of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put his first films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also proof of the sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran &quot;is required&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes from the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, is writing a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false film crew in the Tehran bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much in too many places shares </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to settle for a subject that does in fact that few exciting scenes, the film sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is doing very well, he adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the Tehran airport is ruled out by a telephone call in America and the continued on the runway are quite far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its character dispelled, due to the need to show too many things to too many different locations. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are utterly charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters have deserved greater attention and it is not, far from it, the only in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The movie Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he lets see with a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It leads the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a story, in a way, unfinished to date, and as the exaggerated illustration of the representation of the secret services such as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the bank charges the most absurd, has now decided to launch the competition regulations or ideas from &quot;the EU&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU is considering, recently, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies has been at the root of our decision,&quot; said to the newspaper Pr√°vo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, however, women were an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can report until the end of the year another incredible idea of &quot;the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013,&quot; informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the EU&apos;s controversial regulations is found, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, which has harmful effects on the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the cages chickens, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Critics have also been made in the past against the ban on the use of the term &quot;spreadable butter&quot; or withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes applications of its banks by threatening to use its veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas should not be larger than 14 cm or submit an &quot;abnormal curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has defended by arguing that it was only harmonize national standards non-homogeneous, complicating trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives wasteful of foodstuffs. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulation of last year, according to which must appear on balloons a warning stating that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has referred to an American investigation, according to which the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 to blow in the trumpets of fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Here, too, it was strange ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The following rule concerning the EU officials themselves is quite absurd: Because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and should instead talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot;Laissez Faire&quot; of liberal economists, the server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the EU&apos;s rules on the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic was second, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked, therefore, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey found merit in the idea of paying money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of giving a subsidy for the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact of not having sea we handicaps. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We are going to ask the European Union a refund. &quot;Thus expressed in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> He argued that, as a result of our production of wheat, and following the so-called &quot;interventionist&quot; purchases, the State was found with full stocks that he had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for grants to municipalities have been proposed by the Ministry of Local Development headed by the Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU), they should, in effect, be used to write applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU said: &quot;The bizarre regulations are rare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, efforts by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fight it does not always winner) raises strong emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name &quot;Olomouck√© tvar≈Ø≈æky,&quot; for which the name &quot;Tuzemsk√Ω rum,&quot; which dates back at home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzem√°k.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the alcohol-based products of sugar cane, and not based on sugar beet, may bear the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products from the EU, there are today in the company of world known as Feta cheese or Gorgonzola, L√ºbeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarsk√© suchary&quot;), and of carp in T≈ôebo≈à Poho≈ôelice (&quot;Poho≈ôelick√Ω T≈ôebo≈àsk√Ω kapr has&quot;) and hops in ≈Ωatec (&quot;≈Ωateck√Ω chmel&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread Pardubice (&quot;Pardubick√Ω pern√≠k&quot;) and cakes called &quot;Cornets of Ho≈ôice&quot; (&quot;ho≈ôick√© trubiƒçky&quot;) can also be proud of their Community trade mark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want me to save the Republic, but I&apos;m only an amateur, expresses Senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how was the idea to stand in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president who account for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything was operating without problems in our country, I wouldn candidate nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer bear to see as the country was looted over the past 20 years, that thieves are not behind bars and taxes and the retirement age increase. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that does not please me, then I&apos;m trying to find a solution for change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation for me to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered the Senate, but you have quickly en route to the Ch√¢teau.: Seat of the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it that you don&apos;t turn our backs on those who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I am in the battle for the Ch√¢teau according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would revert to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> That is why I need to influence the largest and broadest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that as a nation we r√¢lons at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It was, for example, said in my statement that I bribes journalists or that I was the adviser Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Come to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have begun the fight for the Castle with a hobbyhorse themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million CZK [of]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To this end, you have to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I pushed for the activities of a tourist guide is a liberal profession, I have been successful. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the politicking: When someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it is delaying the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent, a member of any party, I have much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and dogma supporters, take each party what is best for our country and implement it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You think of yourself as a man of right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that this is a bit to the left or right, it is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, it&apos;s not that people are left or right, but to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I still support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS, and I am just as impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you we will go when someone tells you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you have said does not prove it? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to bring you. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke were implemented by the world-renowned experts have talked about it. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You do not long ago certain in politics with this. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you&apos;re going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose material and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my camp to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president by popular vote, it was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, bluntly, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just entering politics and I&apos;m trying to get the support of the majority of my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I am trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn&apos;t work, I&apos;ll quit in six years and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is a bit as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person can&apos;t make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Janƒçura, but he refused because of the amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√° which revealed the fraud in oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I introduced myself because people are really angry, but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you intend to base your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I don&apos;t have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don&apos;t have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I did that twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You don&apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk of tax returns, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think about 60 million worth of my personal property. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I was in Prague land worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of works of art worth about $10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a ≈†koda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I&apos;ve always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was guapo with women and fought against evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive Aston Martin, you have a legacy worth $60 million and you don&apos;t have money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you don&apos;t want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I did not 15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I should into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested $2 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I don&apos;t have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Overall my campaign expenses are covered by the compensation that I will receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I couldn&apos;t live, for example, pay the English school of my son, which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only goal was to make money, I will present in any elections. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will therefore continue your commercial activities in order to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Didn&apos;t you said that you would put your activities under wraps? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not linked to the amount of the remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take in the spring of the direction of the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I feel I live for something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in Saturday&apos;s edition of the journal Pr√°va. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. For proof, just look at Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a shopper on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large company next door, said: &quot;Yes, it is actually nice, this building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries elderly, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a bedroom community that is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record enough. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brain drain, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the shadow seven bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small reinforced concrete painted miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Thus, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to retake control of the statistics: The construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the office of architects MVRDV Rotterdam, master charts &quot;bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury is still watching, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice by order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech buttressed arguments by activists: &quot;Common dear!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The building is part of a revitalization project also includes an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and stepped houses for a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books received the second &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Moreover, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, this small town dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white fa√ßades suggest they support a dairy, was developed by a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: El Dorado book under bell to cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Admittedly, a lift takes you through the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture are open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floors and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of the municipal public squares. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> There is already in the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the stacks are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; explained Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and open spaces of reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully constructed: In the middle are the offices, the library Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the building&apos;s technical center. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes the banisters. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for sight, touch and smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers building hardened do not want unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trouborst, head of the project to the commune of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Thus, one day we found in a farming business center with an ad hoc waste from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, has been used for years of the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and it is gaining time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, thick plates of four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of heat and pressure, &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports footwear. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the 105 walks is the summit of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> After nearly 500 metres, the literary caf√© offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also of the Dutch nuggets and potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They create an atmosphere, but above all, they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> New donations for the soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is unbelievable, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model project in ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the building is settled by geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun shines little time inside, even in good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams mounted wrong in relation to the glass facade of sun visors, intercepting a large part of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Completely automated blinds can do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risky to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, describes the Boekenberg as &quot;the soul finally found&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully-stocked (today, there are 70,000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are overflowing from all sides. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a library half empty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and the new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV reached discipline mistress called, in the professional jargon, &quot;the creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Although it may seem young and poorly educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But it was then chosen abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is struggling to adopt a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of a common and coherent policy within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans face on several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the path to a more normal &quot;foreign policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In practice, that means when the term &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to adopt positions that are independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national records. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: That is why Germany needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have affected Germany&apos;s position vis-√†-vis the Middle East conflict and abstain from the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany was first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is undoubtedly a decisive factor. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I do not give too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But that is in any case a key element in the German strategic thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany affect its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even that Germany will be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> The opinions differ between the United States and most European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the US domestic political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course not defend its position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm about the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany is struggling to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it is not helpful for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be placed within a broader political line and must assert their unique position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is what they are doing now in the issue of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future role of locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany will play a role as an important player on the international stage, Germany does it only assume a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or was it always difficult to assume leadership roles? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not make things any easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: We don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this vantage point, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must deal with neighbours and very diverse opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the United States&apos; influence on European policy is only decrease, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are just less appreciated is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America collectively analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind the name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The mark enjoys protection as well as the company that bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, it is not clear that it would succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new record arrived on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators require only a few extra letters to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also copy legally, like Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which the recordings made with the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually that counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pattloch cases, however, are different: Its constituents the responsibility to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally conferred with Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese talk of &quot;Bang Mingpai,&quot; parent brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are designated women who marry men who are rich. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, we need to combat this trend,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The mark is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs totalling millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the flagship products expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third global market for luxury goods and the one that is growing most rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to cancel registrations doubtful of the register of marks and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> They can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reported cases in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiaire, because it would have damaged its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also concern graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had to buy back the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the logger Volvo, used before a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarize of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of anything. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admitted, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the Office would be spent last year of an &quot;emergency situation in the conduct of the work to a newfound normality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> For example, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75 percent over the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the Office, it is a record, and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This also would be true for the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each recording reported an average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle is far more, as illustrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle to be suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany,&quot; said Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office had therefore dismissed the objection of Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has certainly been successful with the following two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The vigilance is </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praising the professionalism of judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, he added: &quot;The process is long, hard and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives has even had to review the actions of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party &quot;a large sum in euros to six figures&quot; to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;That is what we see what it means for us,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This would be the case if imitators of this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to testify in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company of footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;Vigilance is called for.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advise the German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should also register &quot;in China everything that is likely to be protected,&quot; in the words of Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg was losing the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Alternatively, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Day to Combat AIDS: Stomp, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeated in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcomed their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> This is the story of a link that passes much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, they tap their feet: The cowboy boots, sneakers, the pumps for ladies and loafers for men seeking the pace by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Secondly, the voices of the singers are growing slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they will prevail, mesmerizing and follow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses its canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with its wild gestures of flexibility. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in human medicine man at home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;OM Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each chorister has different words, all in a language very exotic: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, said that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> $23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland has 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 AIDS orphans in the village in eSitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the association &quot;Voices for Africa.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them are attending secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per less, it can become godfather. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This guarantees the child money to the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the centre mug. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;storyteller&quot; or even &quot;singer of praise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak fluent in the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost 10 years, the choir repeated songs in the foreign language that she has brought in Germany for now make it to his native region: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because at 8,733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is eSitjeni the village, which depends on the power of the German voice choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> With 40% of people </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV won their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In eSitjeni can be seen on a smaller scale the ills that beset Swaziland: The HIV infection rate the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population accept almost never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven reducing the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a trip to Africa group in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have mostly seen many street children who were not only the parental care, but also simply everything: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without school diploma, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the beginning, there were only a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely a year later, the choir based &quot;Voices for Africa,&quot; an association which deals since then almost professional AIDS orphans in eSitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial STIs, syphilis, and gonorrhea chlamydi√©es (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Common STIs are HIV, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic lice and scabies belong to STIs parasitic. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear among men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are at the root of at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Adults heterosexual infections linked to chlamydi√©es, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections occur among this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, there is a rate of infections linked to chlamydi√©es significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to EU surveys, three-quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the change in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not required to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: The figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause abscesses genital and urinary pain, loss of white, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the emergence of buttons and warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts therefore recommend to anyone who often changing sexual partners to conduct regular reviews. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most STIs quickly detected can be cured and the late sequelae can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that are reaping the choristers through their voices across Germany, means accumulate. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros in eSitjeni,&quot; said Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that orphans are well-housed in one of their grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The victims, it&apos;s so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that they go every day at the time at school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has no person is allowed in a safe place, Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid for by the association, just as the two cooks prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has created a school sewing and allowed the construction of two barns. With the support of the American organization for health PSI, the association has organized an HIV test for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This cannot be taken for granted, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it is still a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is a real taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is an issue that affects sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The Africa&apos;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Yet condoms are found on every street corner, &quot;said Annette Lennartz,&quot; but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh from flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to foster some cultural exchange, choristers of Imbongi leave together on a trip every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the tip of the black continent still know during the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good humor and joy, but also sometimes hard a tear a few formidable border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes them still in eSitjeni where the choristers visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, eSitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to eSitjeni, you will find the light,&quot; say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a trip to 8,733 kilometres, back in Heidelberg, before these choristers who tap into the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Stra√üe, there is also the light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice layer could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this is the closest planet to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the world permanently immersed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is probably comets or asteroids that would have hit Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody made any link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, &quot;said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements to life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> From time to time, they send images to the land, such small spaces through which we see infinity. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which orbit around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet,&quot; according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of the countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are blue and pink points, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;babies&quot; in the delivery room of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, named &quot;W5,&quot; a name little romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The NASA Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a dying star. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the vast Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pleiades star cluster also known as the &quot;seven sisters,&quot; can be seen with the naked eye during the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, the telescope puts more colors in value. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> In this photo infrared, the Helix Nebula, such as a red eye, looks directly at the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a land continent earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo shows a dramatic hue. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the most intriguing mysteries of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared 4.5 billion years without a trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the most important photographs and sharper that has taken the Hubble telescope is that of the galaxy of Tourbillon. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name comes from the Latin word &quot;Trifide trifidus&quot; (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the gleaming heart of the birthplace of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pileup in the constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies molten rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like the abbreviations techniques, you can use its nickname of &quot;wheel of Southern fire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula of Iris, in the constellation Cepheus. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula is located at 1,400 light-years and is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo was developed using optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle consisting of black holes at 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy &quot;GC 1810.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this cloud is the group of the brightest young stars in our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The heavenly cradle always gives rise to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there are only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after no Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our view of the universe: The major telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galilee onto a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and through them, it was possible to see further into the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Great Canary Telescope at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter still reaches about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its uniqueness lies in its great capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in the world&apos;s mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists listen to the universe in the search for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help to the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or&quot; search for extraterrestrial intelligence &quot;) by involving the computing power of his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here lies the Very Large Telescope (&quot;Very Large Telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can inform the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not take photographs before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes in Hawaii&apos;s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Observatory on Mauna Kea who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope and FTIR. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration to admire it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the most important space we come from the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990, we book images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope seeks exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be to find the light reflected by the first stars and galaxies after no Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable data on this theory exists because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole of Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The radar data indicated for decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip to the mountains Talysh is a disheveled romanticism. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> In the middle of the many turning points in the road, the small bus principles prevailed: ‚Ä¢ along wooded hills, torrential rivers and small farms. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, it is almost in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, on which it is not much, except that they are fluent Farsi and Azeri and they have a very long lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminal: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era who do not agree with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision, and next year, there will be a festival of older people in the world,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> You can discover the lives of about eight tens of Talysh region who have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Here is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Yet have a child to 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, a shepherd who had 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when you think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of M√ºsl√ºmov seems to be more than questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;It was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and he would have been 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov would have it wrong for a few decades by calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Surprisingly older people also live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia, too, there are men who are incredibly old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tour guide, explained that the Talysh have specific genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> By contrast, Fatulayeva, the museum&apos;s director, believes that it is a question of food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calorie-rich meals Talysh, who like meat, bread and milk products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the young people? At Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years old, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She is sitting on the ground beside a churn, it beats the content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children enjoy also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for guests served in glasses armadus typical in the form of belly. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding in a dark blond dreadlocks that her son tells us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I&apos;ve always washed my hair with milk, and that is how I have never lost and they have kept their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo,&quot; adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always ate what comes from his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she tells of her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the &quot;beloved father Heydar Aliyev took over the controls. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, does almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good standard of living in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And maybe the son long greying of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;Seniors are highly respected in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the large family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The &quot;human rights&quot; in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution is reborn in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations reveal the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian President is not short on words more emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to make the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was intended for the entire people, but also to Christian Copts, liberals, informed and secular Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition confused and hopelessly disunited are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its own &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world does not really know what wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary will be reversed? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the Islamic-dominated Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a night tour de force of 15 hours are indeed worrisome to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the case law is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what really means the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and it is always a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that the Islamists were using the vague wording and the margin of manoeuvre resulting legal to implement a stricter interpretation of sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case, it is that suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to the sharia, Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislature, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to suppress opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State must also, can be read in the project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote morality and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the State institutions could even control the content of art cinema and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, it would be simply censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantees equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another article prohibits offend or to defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> By contrast, the article does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Just as questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many points are open to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, in his own words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution&quot; rising </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is reborn and we will win,&quot; launches Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is &quot;thrown into the dustbin of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi&apos;s supporters of trying to stage a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and the reverse,&quot; exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet redeemed,&quot; said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced not wanting to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well-organized, called for a counter-demonstration in Tahrir Square not as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;The people calling for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Cleans our country!,&quot; asked to Morsi, saying that &quot;the Koran [their] Constitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where it all began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, along with his supporters, had spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of Islamists certainly will win a majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;Human rights are not mentioned only once&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have been imposed last until February and encompass all social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The human rights lawyer for 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he shared their vision of the world, but because for human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> That is the reason why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution,&quot; he says during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of Morsi&apos;s powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy, and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president denied all its powers,&quot; deplores Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Yet, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could afford. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> One protester in the square Thahir warns: &quot;You giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be possible to control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk Norway: Is it the most fragrant fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of premises for an extremely fragrant fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, at about 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It is snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period - according to the smell that you want it stinks - up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness settles and it&apos;s cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, Fagernes, devoted to this incredible delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, full-time local firefighter also known as &quot;Rakfisk General,&quot; responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and slip a large quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer aquavit the rakfisk,&quot; says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I&apos;m trying a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid getting under your nose, it&apos;s not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in barrels of water airtight, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, once well fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the senses undermined by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedes, their old rivals, whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, Norway&apos;s past. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is part of the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost ‚Ç¨10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not for her debuts. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about the killing, they talk about &quot;the incident of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own was able to commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success,&quot; said Anna, our waitress, the blond hair and blue eyes transfixing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a hand-rakfisk plateau. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how do you say - people conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not like to point out. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries were throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse strings tightly. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,&quot; said Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk,&quot; she added in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I&apos;m standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my share of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stayed is one of many places that serves the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the strongest scent of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot-butterfly, surrounded by rakfisk bases. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> You would think that in the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What did you give score to the best fish in the mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;This is our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We hear laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man fell out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, looks at the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam safety has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access into the capital and causing chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, results that must be to the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of some 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Prior to the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A sprawling, populous state surrounding the capital. On his land of choice, opinions are divided on the new leader. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Direct a man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The premises to attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was made to these roads, formerly the dented and full of cracks. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Bearing his name plates hang outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We are counting on him to establish lasting change,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party&apos;s congress and M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change that our country desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> Unwavering after 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He rejects the criticism from opponents who complain that the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> This is a man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden beneath the Nazaire highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the military has been called out to combat drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone, it was found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that, at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back the tears when she shows me pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version reported a suicide by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believe that she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,&quot; says the Se√±ora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis was already underway. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall, next to a cross which contains the word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, this is exactly what the family has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossipy, a hero of disorder, a main problem?. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to accept what they say and silencing ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be as good as president when he was governor,&quot; said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during the detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on Manning&apos;s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning was made under extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to show, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the American army -- missed many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the case be classified Manning on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and has been a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This military intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers have asked questions to Manning and recorded her answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment by his guards was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he had within the prison was generally &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not report any complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly when asked about his treatment in prisons, &quot;said Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said that they would fix, but they have not recorded the issues raised. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote&quot; no problem &quot;(after addressing the concerns), but this does not mean that I had not caused any problems,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning was also asked why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a &quot;risk of injury.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they assigned him this restrictive status -- one level below the close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to be removed from this status... to enjoy a better quality of life, from my point of view,&quot; said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and will be gone once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact that they have not been kept abreast of what he was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, the cage,&quot; said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I was going to die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning has also added that the only objects there was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He has tried to remain in motion, because sleep or lie down during the day was contrary to the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woke to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Counsel for Manning has filed a formal complaint to the treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also Friday, the judge asked to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- after they have been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning, during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover themselves with a blanket during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the judge&apos;s questions, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he should drop its coverage that could hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered the release. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning allegedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his or her flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all charges are raised, he could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; they remind Mexicans difficult times, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette said that the Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two tracks: One for the &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros (&quot; Strangers &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what lead me to lead. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I was called the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is an ethnic qualifier, in the same way as the one that my friends in Boston use when they say, &apos;Irish&apos;, or my friends in New York when they call themselves &quot;Italian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Secondly, I became &quot;Mexico-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land that was the birthplace of my grandfather, there is no need for special qualifier or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I don&apos;t have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can&apos;t lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my U.S. passport and I headed toward the queue &quot;Strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto paid a visit to President Obama at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to join forces in the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their land at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a U.S. official made the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma seek the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico City-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want it addresses the subject of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, one person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And more often than not, that person was a typical profile -- a dark, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not that of Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We attach to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Moreover, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent us as if we were people of Mexican lower strain and not enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico City-Americans are upset. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a U.S. citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Moreover, many Mexico City-Americans I know don&apos;t have the impression of being part of a country or the other. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we are as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, for a little more complicated the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to move closer to the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico City-Americans working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that it is essential to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if we consider income inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to fend for themselves, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico City Americans still want them of how family members were treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> A further bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While the same arguments persist futile to know who began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel and the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps their fight will increase even more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them out of this impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is no loser and no winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza had been crushed. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Killing some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends the rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a booming regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The members of Hamas are growing and say that the Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Al-Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas&apos;s allies are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a significant player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been in a box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The missile interception system, called the Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas to be at the origin of the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that cuts into the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election of January 22, has a beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why spoil the pesky by giving them a Palestinian state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they ran the West Bank, do they not launch rockets, like their compatriots did in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind this wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe the hard-liners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring makes a difference. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think about the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be pushed by those outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains as advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: Two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for people outside of this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now get down to halt the flow of arms into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a pseudo-state at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not submitted its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is a very narrow vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws on cigarette packages neutral came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This Act came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the strictest regime in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government said that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99 percent chance that they never starts. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even when they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco companies through their brand image,&quot; said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children tied the crown logo to a princess. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would reopen the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;Adverse consequences will result from this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others said that the law had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the request for cigarette cases, including packaging to mask the horrific silicone, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, the sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to hide the cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work in the tobacco marketing and that you have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place par excellence,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We need to ask whether it is a private citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and who has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry is focused on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have reported to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos warning on packages in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you put the package,&quot; said Victor El Hage when buying a package that shows a photo of cancer of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason I will stop, this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the heart of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult stowing packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now, it takes me four hours,&quot; said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had only to ban them once and for all, and we would have said OK, it is good, you stop and you put the key in the door,&quot; he said, lifting his arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world that is constantly connected, it may be good to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours at an airport during the period from Thanksgiving, as our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> A half-day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain to take interesting, or even to foster creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Should we welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back to. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom is a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, &quot;said Peter Toohey, Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of&quot; boredom: A Lively History &quot;(Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The problem goes back very far,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they go back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then, there is the definition we give to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, &quot;said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After numerous publications and submitted the idea in a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is &quot;to want to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, it is &quot;the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem stems from the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem is. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we may think that we&apos;re bored when it is in fact a problem of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high a TV show that had no report, others have just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group has not heard the soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the TV to low noise level said they had more annoyed than the other two groups - they have found it difficult to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or involved, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, &quot;said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when you make a boring task, &quot;like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you don&apos;t get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he said, now we know that when wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidgeting learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless,&quot; said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We&apos;re bored all one day or another - the delay of my airplane flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a film particularly boring. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a &quot;predisposition to boredom Scale&quot; in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The range includes statements such as, &quot;Of the tasks that I make, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many points of interest that I do not have the time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, &quot;said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, adolescents are quickly blase. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent said they bored when they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that &quot;adolescence is a period when boredom reached its highest level,&quot; particularly because children and adolescents don&apos;t have much control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I ask my question: Boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, &quot;said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The problem is the way that the brain was found to inform you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, this will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and give him an iPad, it no longer will miss, but it will not have learned to handle alone or if autor√©gler, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;this autor√®glement passes from one situation to another,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child does not just learn to play, he gets more control of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think we should glorify the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not think that we should criticize it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel at ease outside the constant ferment generated by the activities and technology is the goal towards which we should strive for. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to be bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy the downtime. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimul√©s,&quot; he added, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, was indicted for something that will soon become legal in his state: Pellet possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used to its consumption - minor offences, each with a $100 fine - and a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving lower drug use depends more on the place of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were closed due. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have ceased to indict adults aged 21 or older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts in Colorado called for speeding up the existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who possess. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of western currently vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Things are changing so rapidly that I don&apos;t know what the future holds,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in Washington State are also quite a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that the Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating on marijuana, first on the Therapeutic Use and now with regard to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, &quot;said Mr. Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is no real precedent on which we could base,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a gap of a year, during which the permit system does not yet exist, while the possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: How to balance the mandate of the state that ensures adequate access to marijuana approved and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a cannabis sales registered trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legalization of cannabis, a research group recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the &quot;City attorney&quot; (representative of the Public Prosecutor) would prosecute more people aged 21 or older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to charge people for this type of offence &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado, &quot;district attorney&quot; (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to handle cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on users to seek treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to take legal action against those persons who have committed an offence which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence,&quot; said Mr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions were complicated, even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favour of the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, argued that decision, but also decided not to discontinue all cases of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not seem to lose my time to continue to apply the law until it is changing,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> While 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, provide an appropriate government and legal framework for the personal use of marijuana is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities underscore the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a cultural barrier&quot; with the representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws &quot;(National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, too, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to deal with the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they look with concern the guidelines of the federal government, which is always the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will sell. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has enabled businesses for sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, in Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police is unlikely to break through the doors to capture small packets of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes the licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, &quot;said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities of Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is only a year&apos;s delay. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should impose the ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I have been bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a &quot;Tory (Conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the free thought and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Yet, two weeks after being installed in Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and began to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A. N. Wilson said facetious remark that I was party after being forced to drink cups chipped in. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and is the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I had a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist behaviour and barbaric: My late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why talk about this today, you might say. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students centre-right suffer the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were &quot;often isolated, and felt personally attacked undesirable&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to have a representative on the Committee of the university for equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (&quot;The Wonderland: Young, effort and Right&quot;), devoted to politics among students, and which depicted the Tories &quot;as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It found in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), &quot;which moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver full and moves with a cane chrome head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say they are treated as scapegoats for the establishment of the increase in tuition fees. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years ago, vice-president of the &quot;Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that&quot; there is a growing leftist bias in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR against people who are center-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is an obstacle to freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think so during my first few weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I am beginning in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a crippling shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week, when the new students have been acquainted with each other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what would happen afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm toward students Tory, but they took pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I wasn&apos;t prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I lost footing. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man in the face pustular, was losing easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is it that which refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; He asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears were burning eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you&apos;re not too busy to make friends,&quot; he launched a truculent tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner that evening, I sat alone and then I felt a tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a second-year student of English, appointed James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said, gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that this happens. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide cowardly. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I did not agree with everything that was said by Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This has failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How the Tories are they love?&quot; Asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, isn&apos;t it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Labour and deny my views? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory of stigma and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher&apos;s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the Marxist-deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open-minded city dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He was in disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he told me pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not do that, not in the city to the spires dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends Communists had impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in her eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Let them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that it is for teasing. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would break the heart if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has steadily deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a meeting of tutorials the following week, when another history teacher suggested the more seriously in the world, that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Lethy44 internally shame, I admitted to be a victim of brainwashing of my parents and the &quot;old traitai crazy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I stayed cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I never went back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me to wimp pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no children under 18 should not be a victim of such a bullying in school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a strong reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers the elegance to notoriety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> As part of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other celebrity clients of the Italian fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has acknowledged at the opening of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture,&quot; a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I love this palace,&quot; he said with his inimitable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;his pigments&quot; Garavani, who but which could not have been written without its famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until next March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino described his personal memories as trophies of its social mobility: The modest fashion designer of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the international jet set. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is nothing wrong with love the royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least, they do not overwhelm their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as do some pop music stars,&quot; said Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We all our homeland be invited in his chalet in Gstaad,&quot; explains the ex-wife of &quot;&quot; Heini Thyssen, a close friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Even so, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in decoration, food, music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With him, each guest feel important and appreciated,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;It never pass fashion, because his creations are works of art,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Line of nobility parade </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Garavani&apos;s life is not a story of obsessions but shared love. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He likes people well behaved and with the biggest titles and they love it too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: The visitor takes the place of mannequins and to march on the podium to admire a &quot;public&quot; dream of bearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte,&quot; or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among the public of mannequins are names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothing are like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket &quot;Gillette&quot; and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a gift that I had done,&quot; said Naty Abascal, one of the designer&apos;s muses. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer to all others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty,&quot; added the former Duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Princess and Patricia Della Giovampaola modeuse d&apos;Arenberg cannot also forget the first time she has been a model Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and was living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his gowns for evening... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red evening gown with a tiered skirt, a strapless draped and backless to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said the widow of Rodrigue d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess d&apos;Arenberg retains the designer&apos;s evening dresses with &quot;the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, she is also the memories that she vehicle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of the </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the designer named its seamstresses) to achieve this silk dress with inlays of ivory beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half metres behind. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress is a historical fact of haute couture at the end of the twentieth century, &quot;the return of customers of high society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the &quot;well being&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani combines more honoured than any husband of his clients. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;Its refinement, its calm, aesthetics perfect and I have always been evident,&quot; Arenberg acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw him, it was a month ago, at a gala dinner at the Mus√©e d&apos;Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my dear friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess who said... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilograms of sulphur through the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living by wearing sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth hardens on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having reaped large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilograms, it installs them in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through steep trails. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the porters exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail&apos;s pace, keeping the balance and measuring their not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extract. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, it their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walked the three kilometres until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 meters above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, arguably, its employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to launder the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; says Anto, who is usually three trips per day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> It takes 3 hours each, and he finished exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it may seem to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would win in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; said the holder who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java to convert to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At age 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will work even two years ago, because I want to open a shop or study French or Spanish,&quot; he says in English promises more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Battered by life, this might be sympathetic and intelligent young tour guide, server or in a hotel receptionist, but, instead, it is the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a wooden hovel unhealthy with other carriers, rises every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to gush out at night, when its characteristic yellow and blue becomes shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the dark, Anto descends into the crater is illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porters load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters who are self-employed and are paid to the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Moreover, they do not affect one in 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is done to animals, not humans,&quot; protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent porter who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, it ensures that it will not stop to work &quot;as long as he can,&quot; because it needs money to raise her three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the tide is turning and trapped miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains of suffering serious diseases... plus, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only charge 50 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, three trucks at the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 miles away by a sheep trail overrun by weeds. </seg>

<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans are laying the blame for this lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of home ownership. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The people of Singapore must grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, are keeping our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint tablets, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a rap group that uses local references like &quot;Let&apos;s put a referendum in the drawer&quot; to make a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency responsible for the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem of fun way through this publicity. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to perform their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that this was an issue that we have to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like launching pheromone scents or organize speed-dating evenings. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative, but they have not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We therefore said the following: What could be more creative in solving this problem than to make a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The Government of Singapore does not take it lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> He spends US $1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy city-state high-tech and South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time he has been above 2, considered the turnover rate, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why Singaporeans do they not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and family formation,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and to delay marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at increasing dramatically immigration to counter the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites that is a thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially to the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the &quot;shoe box,&quot; which can be built in specific areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale enjoyed great success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sell much faster than the larger housing. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who previously were put a spanner in the works if they wished to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of central, it would appear that they do not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that&apos;s why people should defer it,&quot; said a young framework. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people may have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,&quot; says another young for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women report their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private is private online offline </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality, </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or &quot;the field of private life that we can protect any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is it that is in the private domain for those under 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in daily life and social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> He understands the dangers to which it is exposed by circulating on the Internet of events that he certainly did not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeri√≥dico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they associate the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level, &quot;the password and username&quot; when they have applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I&apos;m not my most personal secrets in a post,&quot; says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he owns an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;These are highly classified secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB, I post images fun and games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also discussed with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I will not share any of my pictures or someone who would be stupid,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy recognizes that it was wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating comments or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 on FB friends as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don&apos;t know if they say, I simply position,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> It will not do not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Jose, 14 years old, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on the latter, he admitted that he did not know about 20 people on its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;This does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, nobody has made advances and asked for her address or telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they&apos;d put pressure or required, I simply supprimerais of my account,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Jos√© has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberstalking are not unrelated to the boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A close friend of a friend of mine was extorted money on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to Jose, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;It has only happened in private profile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> We then explains a series of manipulation to configure his account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do it if I was angry or upset. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even though I know that it is the cyberstalking,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the goal of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to seek information, but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras said that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in education from Yale University and author of the book &quot;Digital Natives and immigrants,&quot; uses these words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they, children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We, digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are in the process of learning,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He added that the issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a definite criteria on what should or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity to do so.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use issues that are sobering. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Tell them not to do so is no good,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Secondly, Porras lists some examples: There are things that you would not be telling a stranger, why are you doing on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would like it to publish a photo of you as a friend that you published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you see pictures of holidays, requests you to other people permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everyone needs to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act on-line as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring, </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, age and what it is allowed to share or to publish,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children that we should not talk to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of the Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven agents present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency initially reported that he would be released after the close of the summit, and said that he would be released from one moment to the next on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists&apos; access to information about the summit has been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message &quot;closed session, small audio was broadcast in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among journalists were those given by press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important news. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this has been urged by the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published last March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international events, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague settled a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, gathered at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear arguments from both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and implement the verdict that will solve disputes that we have today before the international court,&quot; said the President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international courts,&quot; added the President Pi√±era giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogot√° by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the removal of his ex-President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala, was asked to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he said that the countries of the Unasur would establish &quot;important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on the residence permit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that shares would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for a better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triumphalist but should help increase our productive matrix and the promise of a better future for our people,&quot; concluded the President Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and by generating new economic channels,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and on cross-cutting themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were for a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will be reinstated within the Union of South American Nations,&quot; in which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic discussed at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through the ICJ&apos;s ruling requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I had a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said the President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua who will seek to have a discussion with this country,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we are going to solve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible,&quot; added the President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the seizure of power of the new president, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers will meet prior to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America to Europe must learn how to integrate a citizenship,&quot; said Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which &quot;South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans &quot;were killing each other during the Second World War&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but that they were now almost a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, Ecuador&apos;s president, expressed support for the replenishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the pact of San Jos√© on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who have bombarded us will never compromise, on the other hand, we, the South American, have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington in the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he did not regret his decision, because it does not itself has betrayed its principles, but he instead met its &quot;profound democratic values and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that, at the time, &quot;there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> In addition, the Swedish justice critic who demanded that he abide on its territory for questioning on an alleged sexual offences while &quot;the Swedish legislation makes it possible to do so by videoconference, which could be from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small problem, but nothing serious,&quot; said the president of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being locked in a small area without being able to exercise in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of anyone,&quot; he concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution of asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stressed that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garz√≥n, launched a series of procedures to various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he believes that &quot;if Britain gave the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as is quite its legislation, as it has done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he said that what he did not tolerate was &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that interfere with freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, it welcomed that this is not that kind of journalists &quot;neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than put forward his re-election, &quot;it would expand the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency &quot;should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts,&quot; because in reality, &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Moreover, the president of Ecuador considers as &quot;perfectly appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We must resolve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said he is &quot;beneficial that Latin America seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment if it is strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he saw this possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that, if he lost the primary to February 2013, it would be withdrawing from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, the socio-economic poverty cannot be resolved only through political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed the eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will do it. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch√°vez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just talk with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of President Ch√°vez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with a call for better regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the test result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen to me on the head,&quot; he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make &quot;less painful,&quot; in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man has hidden his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take one of his illness and began to learn about him and his determination was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest HIV patients at the civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye &quot;because he was speechless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their disease, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of patients who began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectious disease specialist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those do not consuming drugs: Up to 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis for 25 years, &quot;as long as he remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years,&quot; explained the scientist interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to put this in context, it should be noted that Mexican life expectancy today is 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why is there still death? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem is not with access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we have never failed to drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know they are infected, or else they learn in the advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is conducting earlier diagnoses, and for that, we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who request it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the State Council AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has done its screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and suffered from Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some believe that they are going to die and don&apos;t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I die, it is better that I broke out three times a week,&quot; they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but partly responsible, I pay attention to me and to the other person,&quot; said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with JALISCO ARE GROWING in to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, when the march of the World Day Against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They are the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon whether they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, by being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, &quot;said Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has taken up the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all places dedicated to this, &quot;it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now it gives us packets of 100, it is all very well, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Asked sarcastically and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, ensures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at counters, but that they can be found in the public toilets and distributors in places that youth frequent. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not to encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> This is not to pay the girls and the motel, as the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez replied when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It&apos;s not like this that operates sexuality, it is best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is the fourth state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in the number of people living with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infections are sexually, 6% from blood and 2% by perinatal route. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, as recorded in each case, there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> An appellate court ratified by a United States court ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro granted via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario is causing a negative precedent for all national societies have ramifications in the neighbouring countries and having solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> So it looks like corporate survival procedures authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the Stripes, opposite view of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, left defenceless Mexican companies face the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow the largest manufacturer of glass of Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register under the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main commercial bankruptcy procedure is formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean to denounce the cooperation of international procedure in business insolvencies with a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the consistency of the International Commercial Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Second, the ruling establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro owed to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, Mexican law recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Here there is a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Business Bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, what is certain is that, because there remained the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. &quot;vulture funds&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he met since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis faced off against the United States, passing the costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For now, the company Gonz√°lez Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to be held in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance will non-prosperity and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court had ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) in which detailed the procedure was followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, pointing out that the release of the agreements signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, he said that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile up of two parts: Norman Vitro and they overwhelm the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General balance </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the former boss of the company, Gast√≥n Azc√°rraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviators has already encountered problems. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The body, headed by Carlos D√≠az Ch√°vez Morineau, has just presented a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provides information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to remove the F / 589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The funds were used to purchase shares of the Administration Professional Association of Hotels. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> As everyone knows, Azc√°rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> They laid siege to the Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Meeting this weekend in an auditorium of the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Dragon Mart Chinese in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country&apos;s products of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Previously, the electronic (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the Governors of the Southeast area in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and is the largest of all threats to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The ACTA is </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico&apos;s ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Intellectual Property Institute, this theme is already ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> As everyone knows, this was done while the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Long-term Homex </seg>

<seg id="2866"> Investments in this area exceed the $1.5 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> &quot;H√©ctor&quot; Hetin Reyes &quot;Basketball is my whole life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotter basketball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, through him, has traveled around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as great as that of H√©ctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage is condemned to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player in the lower leagues, the national team player in basketball, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with vaqueros from Bayam√≥n or as chairman of the basketball federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time, like when I was chairman of the NSO, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s,&quot; recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at home in Bayam√≥n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball is my entire life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes not exaggerating when he made this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary, witness. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The heart Bayam√≥n </seg>
<seg id="2876"> For all his memories, those he loves the most are those who reminds him of his time as a player within the vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager and manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;This has been my best years, I have the most benefited because I had the chance to participate in eight of the vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> That&apos;s a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the NSO&apos;s team. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a big player for you, it is two meters. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow was then recommended Raymond respect, who has been naturalized and who was a better shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship, respect would help us try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He was pleased with the championship of the vaqueros with respect, but only at a distance as in 1988 he was already the czar of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you have? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and that we have put a beating on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, respect, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and &quot;Picul√≠n&quot; (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) &quot;To√±ito&quot; Col√≥n and James Carter, the brothers Le√≥n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina&apos;s Neuquen. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What was the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without doubt, it is Picul√≠n Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Picul√≠n. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> That was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In young people, I love the work Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest success within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> It is part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> You remains to be done? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, boys in Ponce play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people travel and play too, while this is not necessarily required. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least given the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, has been globally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series &quot;Dallas,&quot; in which he played an unscrupulous businessman, formidable and manipulative. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He was 81 years. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of &quot;Dallas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2921"> &quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, re-playing the role ironic that he loved the most,&quot; said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and he will greatly miss. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;It was an exceptional person and he lived life fully,&quot; Gray said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Doctors had diagnosed with liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted that he had drunk a lot for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumor in the liver and he had undergone a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Several years prior to &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman had made known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius attractive, played by Barbara Eden, and return home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He has also played in two comedies that remained little time on the air, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his film credits include roles well received by critics in &quot;The Group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterful portrayal of the charmingly loathsome J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed its greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The CBS drama series of the Ewing clan and their relatives was released from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;Who shot J.R.?,&quot; invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in bets played. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average before their screen and have made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which was attended by 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) that he had shot. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. had made pregnant and had then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people had also reason to attack him. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman played Ewing&apos;s role as a corrupt and insatiable human but charismatic smile: A dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to place his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what should be the epitaph for J.R,&quot; Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should write: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here is the only party that he has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, recalled Hagman this Friday as a man of &quot;immense, both on the small screen as in life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know him and love him. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; aired a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> Registration is already completed five episodes for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the moment, neither Warner nor the channel TNT provided on how the death of Hagman will be integrated in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who met fame with such classics as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>

<seg id="2952"> It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and that he married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he called his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin &apos;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot; (in French: Hello Darlin&apos;: The ruthless memories of J.R) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;I have nothing written in this book that might hurt someone or affect in any way whatsoever,&quot; he told the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients worried. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> &quot;I would advise them, I restored their confidence, I come with them when they come to undergo surgery and after,&quot; he says in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to give them a bit of comfort, such as &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid, it will not be easy for a long time, but it&apos;s going to be OK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> A course on the &quot;End of the World&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, shouldn&apos;t, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart charmed decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;countdown&quot; of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, referred to by many people as proof of the imminent end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor charmed had no idea what awaited them in the following months: The catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the &quot;Armageddon&quot; of debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end times thought that would trigger the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that it was going to be the most apocalyptic half that I have never known,&quot; said Professor charmed this week to his students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and told us, this was a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And it is not the only teacher to teach courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple, the assistant professor Barry vacker provides the course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, shouldn&apos;t, viruses and germs and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; says vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Berg and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course simply entitled &quot;The end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add&quot; 2012 &quot;to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not would disappear,&quot; said Professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the looming disaster, &quot;students should study, create projects and spend their final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student choice but to work &quot;until the night of the supposed end of the world,&quot; said Berg. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Courses have proved to be quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It was complete in two hours,&quot; said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the share of people who were asking if there was still room. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;It fascinates me to see what people are capable of doing to feel better,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and nurse for 25 years, claims to have viewed all apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I had never heard of a course that taught this matter,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students interviewed, much less a professor, told us believe in the end date of the world of 21 December. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,&quot; said Julie zegle, last-year student at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, &quot;said Berg. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I admit that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has led to a boom of such speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other parts of the world, people don&apos;t think about it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The majority of the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that it gave courses on &quot;by the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,&quot; we there replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Berg noted that over the years, there has been talk of many alleged dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people will begin immediately to think about the next date&quot; or to philosophize on the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The students and teachers take the date lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several have told us that they thought they were going to parties &quot;the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Sometimes, I call friends and we rigolons together,&quot; said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student. </seg>
