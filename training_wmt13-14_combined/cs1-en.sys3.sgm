<seg id="229"> The British government announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="230"> HS2 company&apos;s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as in 2026 started the first phase. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project &quot;connects Great Britain combined.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="232"> Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on the plan &quot;enthusiastic&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The first phase will consist of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="234"> After the completion of phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In June, the government has revised the estimated cost to build a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion GBP. </seg>
<seg id="236"> The British government, which held talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out more rail capacity and ability to improve travel times for the North of England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="237"> This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Baroness Kramer said, &quot;Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Great Britain and the city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="239"> We gave SH2 green, because the benefits that it brings is huge. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Without it, we are facing a crisis in capacity of our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="241"> But it is also about connections - across the UK will be better connected thanks to HS2 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="243"> For the Scottish government Keith Brown Mr. Carmichael called to &quot;unequivocally&quot; supported the inclusion of Scottish HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds weight to the economic Scotland in the case of total high-speed railways across Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="245"> So enthusiastically cooperate with the British government on exploring the possibility of bringing high speed rail to Scotland and so bring all the benefits and supplement Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government plans anyway. </seg>
<seg id="246"> I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, along with British ministers over the next year and the joint decisions on next steps. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Frontier Airlines is going to charge for carry-on luggage </seg>
<seg id="248"> Frontier Airlines plans during their flights to charge an amount equal to 100 USD for storing hand luggage on board. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee up to $ 100 per hand luggage and 2 USD for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can. </seg>
<seg id="250"> The new fee for carry-on luggage involves baggage in the upper storage compartment, so little baggage under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Frontier says it will charge 25 USD, if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 if passengers will be paying to wait until the coming of the gate. </seg>
<seg id="252"> A company spokesman Frontier Kate O&apos;Malley said that hundred-dollar fee is to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;We do not want this fee chose,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Airlines have started to charge for first and second checked baggage in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space, as much as she could, so in this area often lacked space. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Fees are one way to teach passengers to get on board took less things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> O&apos;Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really does not get more money. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The point is that the most loyal customers of Frontier have clearly expressed that they find a place in the top storage compartment is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers who purchase flights on the company&apos;s website, do not pay. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This means that a passenger in line at the gate of the Frontier can bring baggage that does not pay for anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same bag will pay 100 USD. </seg>
<seg id="261"> O&apos;Malley said that the website and clearance procedures shall be designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="262"> New Frontier fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force before the summer, but the date has not been determined yet. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Passengers often on fees for baggage and other fees complaining, but airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="264"> He argues that the baggage handling cost money, and passengers who require this service, it would have had to pay. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Many on Wall Street perceive additional fee for baggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Most but fees for carry-on baggage did not reach. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Spirit Airlines was the first monetization hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost airline Allegiant Air later followed her example. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The only company that has also such fees, the Hungarian Wizz Air, says advisor in aviation Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges. </seg>
<seg id="269"> In its report of December 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage, Spirit will bring $ 50 million annually. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Sorensen, former chief executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when traveling met with an unusual fees to Spirit for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="271"> &quot;Getting on the plane was the smoothest I have ever in my flying career saw,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I was expecting the gate to see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the advent took place in an instant.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="274"> Frontier also modeled after the company&apos;s Spirit apply charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, you can keep the whole jar and free coffee will be replenished. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Water will continue to be served free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="277"> U.S. Airways in 2008, briefly tried to introduce charges for drinks, but after complaints from passengers that seven months later subsided and no other major airline nenapodobila it. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Last Frontier move to charge for carry-on luggage if the passenger does not purchase the flight directly from the airline, its latest attempt to direct customers directly to your website. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Airlines pay Internet travel sellers such as Orbitz, 10 to 25 USD per each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="280"> This gave impetus to all airlines that have led passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than do it through online travel agencies. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Frontier, in this field has gone away. </seg>
<seg id="282"> In September started giving customers who purchased through an Internet travel agency, only half miles in a loyalty program. </seg>
<seg id="283"> On Wednesday, crop it a reward for miles flown on 25 percent of the miles of paths. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So the way with 1,000 miles long Frontier purchased through online travel agency means a reward of 250 million </seg>
<seg id="285"> The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the company website Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Frontier has in his hometown of Denver loyal customer base, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money. </seg>
<seg id="287"> According to the financial results mentioned in the middle of the corporate partner of Republic Airways Holdings revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter decreased by almost 13 percent </seg>
<seg id="288"> The company is selling this Republic Airlines just trying to solve the financial problems of society Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="289"> We studied 11 thousand LISTING! </seg>
<seg id="290"> We know where you want to work! </seg>
<seg id="291"> In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in newspapers and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Internet thus becomes the most important medium for the publication of job offers. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Even in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, did his share of 26 percent. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) has stabilized at about 60 percent. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Advertising employment opportunities in itself according to the analysis largely reflects the current situation on the labor market. </seg>
<seg id="296"> An example might be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="297"> For example, in 2007, in the same period published nearly 25,900 ads in 2012 to less than half. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Offer of jobs on the internet are focused on a narrower, more particularly qualified occupational group. </seg>
<seg id="299"> In contrast, the employment opportunities in the daily press covers a wider range of professions including Workers&apos; said author analyzes Pavlina Šťastnová. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The level of representation of selected professional groups in the two different media. </seg>
<seg id="301"> On the Internet eminent place ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, developers and financial experts. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Position programmers and managers of small businesses featured only on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In newspapers, the share of these professions significantly lower, whereas large representation include operator and workers&apos; careers. </seg>
<seg id="304"> The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express themselves through advertising offers include education course. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Other areas covered were pursued knowledge of foreign languages, especially English. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The daily press was a demand for foreign language skills presented in three percent of ads, on the Internet at 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Only two percent of employers wanted ads active knowledge of two foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id="308"> Claims for &apos;computer literacy&apos; appeared in 40 percent of ads (in newspapers in 11 percent to 57 percent of the internet). </seg>
<seg id="309"> Experience in the industry was required in 54 percent of advertisements. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Experience requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals. </seg>
<seg id="311"> This is especially the production manager and other senior staff. </seg>
<seg id="312"> For blue-collar workers are mainly mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or the technician electrical appliances, added study author George Tillner. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Employers also in the middle of their ads state property requirements and skills of potential candidates. </seg>

<seg id="316"> One-fifth of the shopping center is struggling with low attendance </seg>
<seg id="317"> According to data from real estate consultancy Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle. </seg>
<seg id="318"> In Prague Bohnice opens for the public Trade Centre Krakow, will be the 19th Prague shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="319"> There are presently a total of 90 major business centers. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Unsatisfactory performance covers about 20 percent of medium and large centers. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The main problems are inappropriately large area to area and poor layouts, ie too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead space center, &quot;said Michal Soták of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Also, according to Head of Retail Agency at Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi is about a fifth of shopping centers struggling with low attendance. </seg>
<seg id="323"> The main reasons include, among others, poor accessibility, low income category of local residents or saturation of the market at a given location. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but the results were mostly disappointing initially. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and reluctant to change their buying habits. </seg>
<seg id="326"> New shopping centers must do more to &apos;lure&apos; their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, service and marketing, &quot;said Samadi. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Availability of shopping centers, according to Soták generally stable, even at some centers is rising because landlords were willing to compromise on the crisis in rent and dopronajmout some units. </seg>
<seg id="328"> &quot;It is true that recently opened some projects that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average availability (eg Breda &amp; Weinstein Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc),&quot; he added Soták. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Business centers opened in the past two years the market promoted by Sylvie Samadi very slowly. </seg>
<seg id="330"> The market place for new projects but it exists. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Number of sites suitable for construction of a successful project is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="332"> For example, in Prague, we see room for construction of the project, which would serve the residents of Prague 6 </seg>
<seg id="333"> The market is definitely room for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called &apos;convinience centers&apos; aimed at daily shopping and service needs of the population living in the neighborhood, &quot;said Samadi. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Also by Sotak exists in the domestic market place for another shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="335"> And as for the little &apos;handler&apos; center and large projects in Prague, medium or large projects or expansion in regional cities. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;Cities like Kladno, Czech Budejovice, Brno and Plzeň have room for further growth,&quot; he added Soták. </seg>
<seg id="337"> In Prague, sees room for upcoming business center at Victory Square, as well as according to him, have a clear potential Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square. </seg>
<seg id="338"> &quot;Intensively developing expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller cities for reasonable rent and operating costs, space is also still some areas for smaller local housing estate or shopping center, or their reconstruction such as the renovation of commercial buildings Prior which benefits from a good location, &quot;said Dita Kubánková of DTZ. </seg>
<seg id="339"> The Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area. </seg>
<seg id="340"> A quarter of these shopping centers are located in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them in Prague, it is clear from the data Incoma GfK. </seg>

<seg id="366"> Report: Obama campaign considered to replace Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="367"> The closest adviser to President Barack Obama, according to The New York Times considered secret ballot to replace the 2012 Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="368"> This revelation is the most eagerly awaited books sensation Campaign 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann &quot;Double down: Game Change, 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="369"> Magazine Times acquired a copy incoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president held senior associates at the end of 2011, an intensive group meetings and surveys to estimate whether the deprivation Biden would help revive Obama&apos;s fading hopes of re-election. </seg>
<seg id="370"> According to the national-political correspondent for the Times Magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the elections should move former Secretary of State Clinton to post Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Only a few of the president&apos;s closest advisers - including Daley, the former head of the Obama campaign, Jim Messina and former chief advisers in the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffeho - known to be considering this change. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The book &quot;Double down&quot; claims that Daley was the leader of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decide not to make this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate by &quot;Obama&apos;s chances considerably increase &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="374"> In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="375"> &quot;I have intensively studied a variety of things and this was one of them,&quot; said Daley for the list. </seg>
<seg id="376"> Do not forget that at the time was president of the awful prospect, so we thought, &quot;Christ, what shall we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> While Daley described the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the campaign for re-election has made considerable investments to determine whether this move pay off in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="378"> &quot;When campaigns to interpret that kind of money on elections and qualitative research, if something really serious does not consider,&quot; said Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="379"> It is unclear whether Obama knew that his team is considering this exchange. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Martin told CNN that Daley asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling cards. </seg>
<seg id="381"> While Daley said he does not think that the president of a potential change &quot;be aware&quot;, the former office manager admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Martin added that the book &quot;Double down&quot; definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe was given to Obama on the table. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama did not know about the research on the removal of Biden candidates. </seg>
<seg id="384"> &quot;Maybe,&quot; said Martin. </seg>
<seg id="385"> So no, Mr. Haske. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that follows not. </seg>
<seg id="387"> It is necessary to develop such pressure to Martin Hašek was deprived of all political office and left the parliamentary mandate. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already very low. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Martin Hašek under the auspices of the promises he made, but each and policies need to be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise of a very consider what can promise. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Trust is the only capital that has policies (Mr. Babis has the material, but the question is whether the policy). </seg>
<seg id="391"> Even the best program promoted a liar is not trusted. </seg>
<seg id="392"> In politics no excuse, politics is stepping down. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr. Hasko, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent declarations that affirm me, So if you just lied - here you can see how difficult it is lying), leave politics alone, like a man. </seg>
<seg id="394"> People then take your apology as an expression of a man who made ​​a mistake and bears its responsibility for it. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Otherwise, you will be perceived as spineless wimp whose words or actions can not be trusted. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Either you want to be proud, even erring man or life Skete. </seg>
<seg id="397"> You may feel that it is unfair that I address only you, But you are the leader and they just misguided sheep. </seg>
<seg id="398"> A leader you are and have always wanted to be. </seg>
<seg id="399"> I understand that you&apos;re trying for a while folded ears, regroup, hatch the shame and then attack again, but so behave guerrillas or podrazáci. </seg>
<seg id="400"> You are, again, in their eyes, the leader, the alpha male, and so behave. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Accept responsibility and walk away from politics. </seg>
<seg id="402"> The black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="403"> While American road planners are scrambling to find the money to repair crumbling highways, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that fits easily into the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Devices that monitor every mile that a motorist travels, and which transmit this information to the authorities, are at the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the Office of State Planning to renovate outdated system of funding of U.S. Highways. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Usually drab designing highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Libertarians met with groups and environmentalists lobbied for the government to be able to use these little boxes that record the mileage and maybe even where you go - and then would have used the information to build the tax base. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Tea party is horrified. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with privacy. </seg>
<seg id="409"> And while Congress can not agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Figuring out how the next decade may move to a system in which the driver pays per kilometer road, which we follow. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Thousands of motorists have black boxes, some of which are tracked by GPS, take the test. </seg>
<seg id="412"> This is true for our nation need. </seg>
<seg id="413"> &quot;This is not a matter where we can collect much,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the State Administration in Southern California, for which the state plans to begin tracking mileage for every Californian motorists in 2025. </seg>
<seg id="414"> This changes the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Used to this technology. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The incentive is the fact that road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at the pump is at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Cars will drive more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The actual federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for the past 20 years has not increased. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by even a single cent. </seg>
<seg id="421"> &quot;The tax on gasoline is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test this system of payment per kilometer. </seg>
<seg id="423"> &quot;In the long term it seems like the most logical alternative,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Experts call it a user fee by the number of kilometers traveled. </seg>
<seg id="425"> It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers, for example, which can help reduce congestion and generation of greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Californian designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the ambitious targets set out in the law on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But Rep. Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said it also sees as most functional long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Representatives from the organization of the free market Reason Foundation are also open to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage. </seg>
<seg id="429"> &quot;It&apos;s not a tax, which disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy in the organization Reason. </seg>
<seg id="430"> People pay directly for what you get. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The initiative is also supported by two former Secretaries of Transport, who in 2011 urged Congress to set out towards paying per mile. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The U.S. Senate last year approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which was to include about 10,000 vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="433"> The management of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal, and did so because of concerns rural legislators representing the components of population whose daily life is often offend many miles out of town for work. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Several states and cities but still moving forward on their own. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Ardent Oregon is that the largest experiment in the country included 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="436"> These drivers will soon begin to pay state tax on mileage instead of gasoline taxes. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Nevada has completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="438"> New York just project explores. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Illinois led the way to a limited extent, for freight wagons. </seg>
<seg id="440"> A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with the coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how to implement this change. </seg>
<seg id="441"> This concept does not just advocate. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In Nevada, which has recently been fitted with a device for about 50 cars, volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government is able to track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="443"> &quot;Concerns about watching Big Brother type and similar issues were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who leads management strategy and operations at the Nevada DOT. </seg>
<seg id="444"> It was not something people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="445"> As a pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on its website warned: &quot;It would be very easy to turn this device into a fully fledged tracking device.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="446"> There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technology infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the records of daily departures and arrivals individuals. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an available technology that would enable the State to keep track of how many miles the car moves, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="448"> If you can, said Khan, the public will be quieter. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Hon on such technology has led some state agencies to small businesses in California called True Mileage (actual distance traveled). </seg>
<seg id="450"> The company initially into action to help the government taxing drivers not involved. </seg>
<seg id="451"> She wanted to break into an emerging market with liability insurance cover, where drivers would pay based on how many will drive. </seg>
<seg id="452"> But this device, which is trying to attract the attention of designers road network because not using GPS and adds only a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded through modem. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;People will be more willing to go for it, if you do not watch their speed and their position,&quot; says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="454"> In some of these pilot programs, there were many big mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="455"> They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In Oregon designers are experimenting with the fact that they give drivers a choice. </seg>
<seg id="457"> They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Or you may not take any device and instead opt to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of the country&apos;s population. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In other places they hope that prudent public on this concept accede if the device will be able to more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In New York with transportation officials are trying to develop tax device that was fitted so that in addition to paying fees for parking meters to provide insurance by mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jam . </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of benefits offered to them,&quot; says design document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Some transportation planners would like to know, however, whether all the talk about pay per mile is not just a giant placeholder problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay Area say that Congress could issue bankrupt the Road Trust Fund very easily solved by increasing taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="464"> One-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid and other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery, when is enough to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Law and Public Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Doing so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="467"> The billionaire who calls you next year? </seg>
<seg id="468"> Kellner, owner of PPF group, wants to buy the operator O2. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Both companies confirmed the meeting and according to various sources from agencies and backstage is said to have a hand in his sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Notification of transactions should still come in November, probably before the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, ie before 11 November. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Kellner competitor Karel Komarek own conglomerate. </seg>
<seg id="472"> This is brand Sazka Telecommunications began to auction frequencies for LTE networks. </seg>
<seg id="473"> And to everyone&apos;s surprise, until the flavors to penetrate the telecommunications companies talked about. </seg>
<seg id="474"> But Sazka now leads a highly experienced telecommunications trouper Robert Chvatal. </seg>
<seg id="475"> He began as a marketing chief Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), and later became the director of Slovak T-Mobile recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Betting Play several cards at once. </seg>
<seg id="477"> He joined the auction and now admitted that he wants to run Virtual Vodafone. </seg>
<seg id="478"> And it makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="479"> If the auction is successful, so do their networks will be able to move existing customers on its own virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="480"> It would probably normally not like Vodafone, but according to the information HN daily, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Vodafone currently suffering agreement with competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will share their networks completely. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Vodafone and partner needs. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And that may be the bet. </seg>
<seg id="484"> If that succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a novice may bid specially designed range) and Vodafone on the auction may not run at all, or he will not mind a limited spectrum auction (not enough frequencies for all). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Vodafone is the bets on the network share. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Vodafone releases a stake into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), allowing quick start enterprise networks. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Sazka between starts to build expensive LTE network, which will also use Vodafone. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Can be satisfied both companies. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Money saved by Vodafone could then spend a provider of solid internet or cable television. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Kellner? </seg>
<seg id="491"> He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak Czech branch is the daughter) got immediately a full-fledged operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services. </seg>
<seg id="492"> But on the other hand, it is a great juggernaut that will wait restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The auction by LTE networks have gained Kellner for O2 and very probably in conjunction with T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Both the company has already declared that the network will be shared. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Auctions could then finally a success, but probably not enough high amounts, which enjoys state budget. </seg>
<seg id="496"> And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-mobile, Kellner or Komarek. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Or two titans of Czech business against global giants. </seg>

<seg id="870"> Festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution solo Carolines Comedy, celebrates its tenth anniversary - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs or large theaters. </seg>
<seg id="871"> &quot;Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played in the club,&quot; said Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="872"> This festival, we have created a way to continue to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="873"> This year&apos;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot; (stand up for heroes), the annual benefit musically comedic performance at Madison Square Garden, which will, among other Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Like this festival has spread, has expanded the world of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Several comedians participating in the festival this year came from non-traditional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Nick Kroll swung his sitcom (happily spicy &quot;League&quot; in fantastic football-theme of the FXX) and now has its own comedy show on Comedy Central Station. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Jenny Slateová was a member of both the program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, but the most famous fast-moving series of videos &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes on&quot; (Marcel mussels in Boots). </seg>
<seg id="878"> How Kroll and Slateová, as well as other young comedians with a clearly recognizable voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, acerbic, racialized W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="879"> One of the biggest draw of the festival is the interview: David Steinberg will talk with Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Steinberg began as a standup comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as the unofficial historian of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="881"> From 2005 to 2007, held at the station TV Land show called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> The meeting was held at the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="883"> &quot;This city is definitely in the comedy Larry entire DNA work,&quot; said Steinberg. </seg>
<seg id="884"> He told me that he&apos;s here, sometimes going through the alley between the two buildings and you think, man, if I lose all the money I might live here. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Many things moved, and otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Maybe Pečinka commentator spoke so that it could agree with that, but the chairman Štěch fanned discord. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Governor Chovanec I was suspicious as soon as he was elected to the Board and confirmed this. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Chairman Sobotka always been a symbol of the poverty CSSD continue. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Other gentlemen performed mainly for their weaknesses. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Senator Dienstbier&apos;s consistent and readable and unusable, Vice Zaorálek is impossible for most television interview. </seg>
<seg id="891"> On that basis, I see no better option than to propose for the Social Democrats Senate Vice Prime Minister Gajdůšková, the only handicap would not start and I think it did a standard of performance. </seg>
<seg id="892"> This is such a good deal that barely anyone from management support. </seg>
<seg id="893"> I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what you did, and continue without tearing the party. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with just a blessing from the President of the Babis and without the Christian Democrats, but lidoveckým Health Minister Hovorka, which is actually a faithful social democrat. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The government should minimenšinová great stability, as advocated by the proper law on referendum and so committed to promoting the Chairman of the Dawn Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Chairman Babiš would eventually reconciled with the progression of taxes, because he is smart and sees that it does not go without it. </seg>
<seg id="897"> The Christian Democrats would have never presented problems because Hovorka is the bearer of the best of what they have, and the government would otherwise have been. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The same is true of YES, there could be found a valuable minister, but he wisely do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also good. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Let&apos;s add the courage to Alena Gajdůšková! </seg>

<seg id="1071"> &quot;Really it comes down to give airlines flexibility and allow them to do things that they believe that they must do to be successful,&quot; said the expert cab space Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> They do not want to let them dictate what brings them profit. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> They know their business better than anyone. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> For passengers more space is essential for the elbow, but the vendor is a growing problem that can affect yields. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> In this dispute, the plant in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $ 700 billion at list prices, enough to tip the scales swung American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> As stated in July, Reuters, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> As Airbus and Boeing argues that achieved by its recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft by 20 percent better efficiency than the leader of the market in this segment model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The performance requirements of Boeing depends in part on a comparison of the design model 777x with 10 seats in a row and the concept 777 with 9 seats in a row. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Profit in unit costs compared 10sedadlovému concept weakened. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> &quot;The reason why Boeing is doing is so crammed more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, leading to passenger comfort in the company of Airbus for Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> On the other hand, analysts say the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers is denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Forty-five centimeters wide seat passengers would be great, but the reality is that the business case for Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat model 777,&quot; said an expert on interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the portal Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Airbus and Boeing are not supplied seats, but offer airlines Catalogue of suppliers, so that they can choose. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Scestovalí dealers aircraft even with me wearing a measuring tape to check the competitive arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offers aircraft with highly dense arrangement for low-cost airlines and regional travelers. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Airbus A350 offers a model with 10 seats in a row, but says it still did not sell. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater editing booths so that it offered some of their aircraft with wider seats in the aisles. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may deter from wool sales 777x. </seg>

<seg id="1093"> Plans to scale back all side activities and wants to focus only on their core business, television. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> The group, which owns the Czech TV Nova and also operates in the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs about 4,500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> The work comes as almost a quarter of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> The Group operates a television in the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> CME is part of CET 21, which holds the license to broadcast television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Flip, Smíchov, heavy and Czech version of MTV. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> How much savings Czech affect where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for domestic television leader TV Nova, is not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> &quot;It is premature and we really can not comment,&quot; said communications director Josef Novy Koukolíček. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> According to the MF Dnes with significant layoffs Czech Republic definitely avoided, but by far the greatest impact it would have on staffing level CME branches in Romania and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The two new bosses Novy Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from longtime director Adrian Sarbuovi during Wednesday&apos;s conference call with analysts talked about how they want to limit any activity that is not directly related to the television business. </seg>

<seg id="1104"> The group, which owns thousands of patents defunct Nortel, filed Thursday infringement action against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that přelicitovala at auction within the Nortel bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> Rockstar consortium that bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, sued in U.S. District Court in Texas by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringement. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Rockstar is jointly owned companies Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, and Sony Ericsson. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Google is accused of violating seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> The patents include technology that helps to connect search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, says the action, which is the core business of Google search. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufactured phones that run on Google&apos;s operating system Android, which strongly competes with the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> In 2011, Google made ​​for Nortel patents initial quote 900 million USD. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Google raised its offer several times and finally offered up to $ 4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> After being in the battle for Nortel patents defeated by Rockstar, Google acquired for $ 12.5 billion Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by trade group of patents Motorola. </seg>

<seg id="1116"> George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots a choice </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Another day, another creepy story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> This time it appears warning that a condition for membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> This gave rise to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The truth is that newspapers Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - it did not translate into newspaper headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> No one also mentioned that the EU Member States spend a lot of time by adapting their official acts unless it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Given that Scotland is now in Schengen, offer continuing non-compliance would be to Brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the Scots really want. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> So it&apos;s a pretty weak story. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> And so old that it had become obsolete. Canard that &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; I heard at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Yet in this tale bearded hides an interesting idea. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Why should not be expected that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Why replace the collar for the London Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> This is a true European story: great postwar plan to unify Europe finally failed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> The crisis of the euro is the so-called Project Europe officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Across Europe gain influence party insiders resistance to the EU or cancellation of the euro as a common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Even in Germany Eurosceptic party Alternativa for Germany - started this year - came out of nowhere and had a federal election in September seized nearly five million votes, making the Bundestag essentially &quot;swept&quot; Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats). </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The home has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The current economic crisis, however, has become a defining moment. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> The economy dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straightjacket inserted on the national economy through adherence to a common currency have led many people to think that the project Europe has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with high budget deficit - this was true only in the case of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks its members on exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and a German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency has southern Europe in the field of domestic production compared to Germany disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure - which encourages Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> In the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of the languid performance. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Not all frozen salaries in the world by stomping reversing the European petrochemical industry inexpensive slate Oil USA. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> The result is a simmering insurgency, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up in the world of the Washington level. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> Berlin but had Paris as the ID card does not need political legitimacy and enforced in Europe its own economic policy and worn French economy left to its fate. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> Result: Right wing Marine Le Pen, anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional options and postponed the ruling Socialists in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> The queue is now 24% of the vote the most popular party in France - an early warning to the British Labour Party that they can not conclude that splitting the right is automatically reflected positively on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> As Le Pen handled his newfound popularity among working-class white man? </seg>
<seg id="1149"> European elections next year would like to use to cross the European Parliament created the anti-European bloc directed against the common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If you are anti-European parties in these elections will lead well, which is likely, such a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament dominate. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Me at that idea, that in the foreseeable future, a growing anti-European feeling and stance against the common currency euro together and destroy him. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> EU will not disappear, but rather to transform into something freer in the sense of &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; who prefer to General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro, but France and Southern Europe restores its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I expect that the UK from this project will dissociate and latches on to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> However, increased interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And where will Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> We can choose to be an area (in principle) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Or we can defend its own economic interests - in the fall and the opportunity to make Berlin and Brussels, where we have to let go. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I assume that Scotland would in a relaxed configuration of Europe did well, provided that it retains its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain their economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> SNP government in Scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe that won a large majority in 2011 because of opposition stance against cuts planned (and implemented) Labour chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> The parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate gender&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Germany became the first European nation to recognize third gender in children born with ambiguous genital tract. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Newborn children will no longer be ordered only either male or female gender. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The new law does not require parents to allow for such children reported any gender, and allows them to bring their birth certificates sex as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> The Act aims to stop pushing on parents to contact their child&apos;s hastily decided on surgery to determine the sex, and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexed. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> One intersex person by the BBC for many years, said: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1170"> I will remain a patchwork created by physicians, bruised and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It is estimated that each year from 2000 children born to one that is neither boy nor girl. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> They are intersexed, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Intersex can be Wallis Simpson. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States says that you can not determine the sex, it&apos;s better to use the best available information and determine them, instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until it is done before operations, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in problems with the determination of sex, said the new German law &quot;seems like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> &quot;Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children it is not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Sex determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait and see how identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> Knowledge of how a child develops gender, is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Nobody can answer the question of why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> It&apos;s a mystery why some people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> Report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but on their biological structure that is not exclusively or male or female, but typically consists of two and can not be clearly defined as either one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> These features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair growth, breast and body, in primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and genitals, or structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by transgender and intersex people in the work area and the level of harassment, violence and prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Boys not conforming to gender now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark the official documents of male, female or &quot;third sex&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Norrie May-Welby, 52letá Australian who in June became the world&apos;s first recognized &quot;sexless&quot; person when she won judicial appeal, that you can keep for life status &quot;indeterminate&quot; sex. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to the Ministry of the Interior will have German passports in addition to M (male) and F (female) and the third sign, X, and for intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> In neighboring France, according to news reports on France 24 issue of gender is still controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strongly Catholic country signed a petition demanding that the school textbooks were removed &quot;theory of gender&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> American Catholic website online is against German law also define and wrote: &quot;With the way the world is dragged to a new situation, where sex is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, they turn upside down the other two pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> One mother of a newborn Maryland also told the Baby zone that would rather see that children assigned sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> &quot;Parenting is stressful itself, without other limitations, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; expressed for websites related to parental care. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> A dozen years earlier, the medical community believed that sex is something like a board that can erase and redraw again. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> But now many question the ethical basis of operations that sexual identity is a complex matter and doctors sometimes choose incorrectly, because they do not know how to respect their sex, children will feel when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century it was called the psychiatric emergency room, &quot;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> When these children were born, did you call a psychiatrist, but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Persisting theories about how to deal with children with ambiguous sex, was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Created a new concept of &apos;sexual competence &quot;and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment - how parents raise their child - were the children&apos;s genes and hormones and shape the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> But in one case from 1966, known as &quot;John / Joan&quot;, his theory became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision recommended that your child is left completely neutered, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> &quot;The media presented this case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> When the boy was 15 years old, got přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 38 years, committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Drescher said that some doctors &quot;this model using&quot; today. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> But in the 90th years, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared &quot;unhappy with the results.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1209"> It was the case with Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous genital tract. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Doctors were not sure whether a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that such a man could never live a &quot;life satisfaction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed by external bodies and testes and was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> In 12 years, got female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> &quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> At 18 he was sent on a plastic sheath. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> What they found was horrifying. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the birth I was sterilized and nobody ever said anything. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> Bruce was born with a disorder of sex development (DSD), which prevent the body to produce enough testosterone to make the right to develop his genitals. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> After he learned the truth, turned back to the man, took doses of testosterone and had to remove the bust, </seg>
<seg id="1221"> The operation caused the infertility. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Today represents another in an organization called Project Interface and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexed. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> But Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice (supporters informed choice) based in California, is worried that the German Act &quot;calls for calibration and stigmatům&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that German law ensures that encourages parents to do a quick decision and choice for baby, vague, &apos;&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> We are afraid that it prompts for intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> We believe that it is better to assign male or female, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But we do not know how the law eventually confesses so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Tamar-Mattisová said her organization supports Australian law because it &quot;allows adults to choose to be included into the third sex&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> &quot;Adults should be able to make a legally valid decision of their own sex,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> German law is going to assign it at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> This is a battle we would at this point not to seduce a young child. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> When they grow up, they may by your own body to make its own decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But Dr. Arlene Baratzová, radioložka chest of Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law, &quot;grant powers&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Baratzové daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Because the androgen receptors are defective, we developed Katie feminine features. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> My vagina, but not the uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Now the 29 year old Katie married in studies at the University of Pennsylvania, working as an intern at a children&apos;s psychiatric ward. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Although barren, hopes to become parents through adoption or surrogacy. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> &quot;The law gives parents a space to make its decision in no hurry,&quot; said Baratzová. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It gives them time to make some tests and change your mind and gives them time to write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In this respect, everything is fine - you raise your child and you love it. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> You have a wonderful child and rejoice in it. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> You do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;It brings the opportunity to participate in decision-making and child and takes away the anxiety that binds parents, because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Finally, the child decide with which sex is more endorses - and this is a great thing. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> It gives children the power to make their own decisions. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> Uhlířský Hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntálu. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in the low Jeseníku at a time (in geological terms) recently. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The last eruption here was still at the beginning of the Quaternary. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> When viewed from a distance is at the top of the hill Uhlířského striking whitewashed Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Succour, built between 1755 -, 1765. </seg>

<seg id="1278"> Their coat is mighty to 50 meters and the area is accessible in the wall of the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In the tuffs are striking volcanic bombs as large as 1 meter. I second eruption ended with an outpouring of lava. </seg>

<seg id="1287"> The mining is managed under the pressure of professionals and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> The problem, however, is the lack of consistency and porosity of rocks that quickly erode, disintegrate and sesouvají down the slope. </seg>

<seg id="1313"> This decision again revived painful memories of June Corteenové, mother of Perth, that the devastating attack is launched on Friday and the other plotters almost ten years ago lost their 39letá twins Jane and Jenny. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> With tears in his eyes said that Friday should be sentenced to death. </seg>

<seg id="1322"> This guy should get the death penalty as one. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Keeping him alive ... no reason to keep him alive, just not there. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Get 20 years for the 202 people killed and hundreds more injured, not so much. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Patek stood before the court as the last of the Bali bombers. </seg>

<seg id="1333"> Francis Pope appoints first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis 22nd February first appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Cardinals are in the clergy of the Catholic Church&apos;s highest position next to the pope and those who elect the Pope, so František appoints its first group of men who ultimately help choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> It is now 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> However, once the Cardinal reached the age of 80 years, who can not participate in the election of the Pope - the group is reduced to 120 and opting for the Cardinals. </seg>

<seg id="1343"> At this moment shows a certain focus on Europe, Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new cardinals Pope nominates the rest of the world to restore balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It will also be the first choice of the Cardinals since Francis appointed as the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who had the task of finding ways to reform the Church. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> &quot;Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the cardinals Pope asks for advice. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In this situation, but we were not before - it is absolutely new. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Valero said that the popes traditionally lifted up to the position of cardinal bishops of the big points, but Frank is &quot;full of surprises - so we do not know who to designate.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1372"> Secret War: Syria, Libya and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Training for Obama as the bombing of Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> U.S. commandos in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Israelis showed exactly how to look bombing Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Without undue hype, threats and millions statement sent planes, you hit the target and returned. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Without leaving lulled official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The whole event will refuse to acknowledge it and to not express it. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The exact opposite is confused and grandiloquent, actions unsupported Obama&apos;s Syria policy. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> A most satisfactory throughout the attack was what the Israelis bombed. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Do not be fooled by the media claims that the bombing &quot;Syrian base&quot; or &quot;supplies to Hezbollah.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Recently, I wrote here that while U.S. aid to the secular insurgents remain in the country only on the rhetorical level, so merrily on Russia supplies arms to Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> A very fresh supply Russian rockets landed in the port Latákija become the target of the Israeli raid. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> Clear message. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> A Notice of Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it&apos;s popular Internet theory should be the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The U.S. government has distinguished two members spaciálních units, probably Delta Force. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> He did not know until now that distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is known heroic death of two former members of the SEALs, who defended the CIA campus in the city, I think they were members of a secret CIA squads, which is made up of former soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> It has long been speculated they did SEALs from the consulate or even residence located elsewhere in the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Now it&apos;s clearer. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected machine-gun nests (just one that both members of the SEALs killed after being hit mortar) is quite surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> They were part of the U.S. commandos in Tripoli, and soon received word of the attack in Benghazi volunteered to intervention and, together with five private contractors a way into the CIA campus in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Obama administration disgrace the fact that during that attack, it was not officially squad deployed a whole, and that is simply reluctant to do. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Commander Commando and apparently without orders release these volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Anyway, that operates in a country not once, but constantly American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> And due to the fact that until recently no such thing officially denied it even now talks about some sort of counseling NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> But it is good that the USA even if half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Although the national situation to resolve it wanted to help much more. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The last secret place a permanent conflict, which today I want to write the coast of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Not so long ago, the media almost spoke of the Iranian Air Force for prosecution of U.S. drones. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Little is known, however, how the Americans effectively protect their drones. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Of course, if you happen to manage to discover its drone airspace, not to do anything with it. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> However, if the Iranians discovered drone in the international area, the situation is quite different. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> And so it was that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom chased American drone in international space above the sea, which was perhaps the first deployment of American super sharp fighter F-22 Raptor in history. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Phantom podletěl to visually verify the equipment without being registered on the radar Phantom or you just noticed and then he suddenly appeared to him and urged Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without a murmur. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> No wonder, when the airplane Phantom of American manufacturing, but remember the war in Vietnam. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Raptor can compare. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The court blocked the Regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching people police department in NY </seg>
<seg id="1411"> A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes in the stopping and searching of persons to the police department in New York and the judge dismissed the case. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> The other U.S. federal appeal court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal filed by the city. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The judge decided in August that the city violated the constitution so that their program stopping and questioning people. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> City its conclusions and its provision of thought, including the decision to allocate supervision, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training program with them. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the requested postponement. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be off the case because he came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, and that a judge did not act as required to avoid the appearance of bias, partly due to a series of interviews with the media and public declaration, which openly responded to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics as part of its program to stop and search people. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Appointed independent supervision to oversee major reforms, including changes in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered to launch a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in certain areas where there is the most frequent stopping people. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In August, the city of New York approved the termination of the storage method names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after police scan. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Oral grounds for appeal, the city is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Tactics stopping and searching of persons criticized a number of defenders of civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Have some form of stop and search people for about for decades, but recorded examinations administered by an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg has dramatically increased to a record 684,330 in 2011, in most cases, were blacks and Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> In 2004, wrote four men, who all belong to the minority action, which is still the case a class action. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Proponents of changes to the program stopping and searching of persons by police departments in NY is that changes terminates unfair practices will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures use different police departments. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but no crime, and that it wasted money, but it will not solve the larger problem is that a police force under pressure after the last decade to reduce its numbers by several thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The judge noted that ended the practice of stopping and searching of persons, which is constitutional, but has reformed the way the police department tours in NY introduced. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> Center CDC issued a directive to schools regarding allergies in children </seg>
<seg id="1428"> On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of children&apos;s food allergies at school. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies on the rise. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> One of 20 children in the United States has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> Center CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> The guidelines include information for schools on how faculty and staff informed about children&apos;s food allergies and how an allergic reaction, if it occurs, to respond. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> It also encourages schools to have adrenalin - the most commonly used brand EpiPen auto injector - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> State legislators recently updated their rules to allow schools to store adrenalin easily. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The child may say, &quot;It&apos;s like someone poking your tongue,&quot; &quot;I feel that I have hair on my tongue&quot; or &quot;language itches me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Tipsport How (not) deleted personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Over a year ago, I registered the site Tipsport.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Then I followed but did not finish because it was sitting on a branch someone from the internet registration could not be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> And because I did not want to go to another branch registration failed, then I moved and because I changed address and identity card number. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is impossible because I have another OP number, address, and it just is not complete and that I should ask for the deletion of data and re-registration. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> So I did, and October 24, 2013, I wrote to tech support to ask for the deletion of their personal data from the database according to the law on protection of personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On that day she wrote me a rainbow technical support that I have to complete the registration at any branch. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Thus began a marathon e-mail technical support, where finally the fourth urganci 25.10. wrote that personal information deleted at my request. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> One could therefore say that could make one new registration and here again the problems began soon I wrote that my username is already taken (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal information, but in the end i knocked this). </seg>
<seg id="1446"> So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal information already stored, to finish the registration at the branch (as may have saved something claiming to erase?), So I contacted tech support again. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> My question is how can I write back to that personal data is actually deleted 25.10. and I sent an e-mail with that error. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> That&apos;s what I did (yesterday around the 15th hour) and write back to me today that I have registered the same day (31 October 2013) at 13.22, and that therefore it is impossible because I used the same name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> What does it matter that I contact technical support for a week already and I deal with them, it still does not work. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> And what about the fact that if it were true assertions (As is) could not register one with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> Just by the way, those 13.22 I actually registered to the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and telephone number and lo and behold, there was my page that my e-mail was sent a link to complete registration. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> But how is this possible when you can not register the same name and date of birth? </seg>
<seg id="1453"> Probably because Tipsport binds to the registration e-mail and phone number and data simply has not surrendered as he claims. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So I again told the technical support that simply lying (either intentionally or not know what to write), because what they write is not true. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Substantiate some screenshots I think the problem with the registration had been before 31.10. so &quot;fake&quot; registration for this is simply not relevant. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> On it I wrote Tipsport curt sentence - I&apos;m sorry, but that you&apos;ve re-registered, we can investigate your claim. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> A communication ended. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Or repeats the same phrase over and over, that binds to the registration name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> They can not accept the fact that registration has not been completed, click on that link in the e-mail and so not really taken place. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> To sum up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but even lying when he says the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> O&apos;s worse is that it can easily prove to lie and try to make it appear that the error is on the client side. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Anyway, after putting the issue on my personal blog to give things a bit in motion and technical support e-mail came that the matter be transmitted to verification and will be informed (after a week of haggling and reminders and warnings to make the same mistake). </seg>
<seg id="1463"> Killing us sorry, but we are innocent, defends the leaders of the Khmer Rouge </seg>

<seg id="1487"> This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes the radiation. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Chris says that ice is lit when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more the league, the more of September. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Charlie, founder of the ice cream company &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious&quot; (lick me, taste great), says: &quot;It&apos;s an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so for 200 GBP will get about 2 g of the substance. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1490"> The protein, which we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> So how hot your mouth protein, increases the pH level and the ice begins to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> We tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for a Halloween celebration, because it causes this fantastic glowing effect. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream I&apos;ve ever made​​, because jellyfish fluorescence is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> So me each scoop is about 140 GBP. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> But it tastes great. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Charlie experimental company based in Bristol is known for its innovative flavors beer, cheese, beef and leaves of gold. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> His next product to be but still ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> He says: &quot;I really wanted to make an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1499"> In essence, it is impossible due to refraction of light caused by ice crystals that form ice, but I reckon with the fact that for some way to do it, find it. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Ski areas want cheaper for families with children </seg>

<seg id="1514"> Cooperation with the organizing team of the Olympics in Sochi 2014&apos;s by Dr. Martina little more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> On what was the last Olympics, we forget. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> &quot;Nothing works as well,&quot; says the head of Czech Olympic mission. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> What exactly is happening? </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Many things work more slowly and less accurately. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> It&apos;s kind of confusing. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> In terms of the invoices are relatively fast, in terms of supplying information on the essential things already that much. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> Maybe one for three months Paci, to provide us with as they will officially designated individual villages to whichever could do all sorts of things. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> We&apos;re still waiting and they still say that the thing they communicate. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> In many ways, still communicate. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> It had at least completed the Olympic Village? </seg>
<seg id="1525"> But it&apos;s not catastrophic condition. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> A month ago we went through the empty rooms. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Houses fortunately stands. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> What does that are empty? </seg>
<seg id="1529"> They need the finished floor? </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Just a basic concrete, thus such was the state of a month ago. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> But they still have time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Although there is a danger that up there on the 26th January vanguard arrive, there will still smell the glue. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> And if he could not keep up, will you? </seg>
<seg id="1534"> President Putin would think there herded army? </seg>
<seg id="1535"> That&apos;s how it goes about. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Just that it was not the Olympic Village = Potemkin village. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Rather threatens to miss the adjustment of routes for example, nedodělají details. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Maybe they will have a path in such a state that we have to take with you boots from the London Games. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> But I believe it had something to give the cluster. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi? </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Now, there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria is that the number varies. </seg>

<seg id="1551"> Place tenderloin election election goulash </seg>
<seg id="1552"> October elections rather than winner brought a bunch of losers. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> It&apos;s not just the parties engaged in the Chamber of Deputies or not received (eg SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the Social Democrats because of their internal schism. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Politicians us instead of beef served a festive weekend election stew. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Jumper of elections became the movement Andrej Babis, who promised voters to change the existing political style of governance. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> Fragmentation of the election results, and the split in the winning side of the political records (z) the will of President Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters which party they Zeman president publicly supported or not chosen in the House of Commons. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> While the president has lost because of unpleasant events strategic edge over other policies, but left him a few more ways to get it back - for example, selecting a future prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> While the Social Democrats, the chances of getting the prime minister in my eyes recede, entrepreneur Andrej Babis closer to the contrary. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Post-election developments, although still far removed from the smooth and speedy formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario leftist Social Democrats supported the Communist government is the development of business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy was better news. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Due to vocal opposition YES to get together with ODS and TOP 09 is still the most likely alternative coalition Social Democrats, YES and KDU-CSL (a total of 111 deputies). </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Due to the split in the Social Democrats, who thus became unreadable and weak parterre at negotiations may be the result of coalition negotiations daunting enough for the party. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> The minority government consisting of the Social Democrats&apos; nezemanovců &quot;at the Castle probably will not pass. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> In addition, any government, to which the CSSD will participate, will be compromised unmet ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> I ask myself, &quot;Nespějeme gravity to other early elections?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Another option would have been rather a referendum on the strength of voter mandate YES movement. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> CSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a stronger increase in income taxes or state bank building fell under the table hopefully. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Pages CSSD, yes, KDU-CSL and the dawn on the other hand the same example to support entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP) to promote employment for disadvantaged people, reduce the lower rate of VAT on selected goods. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Friction surfaces are most frequently found in the perspective of social policy and the size of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> YES has the upper hand now, but so far the most likely coalition program YES, CSSD, KDU-CSL would be leaning more to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Which in my view is ultimately better than left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Until recently it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wished to early elections. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> The reasons were cited corruption, squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> According to the election results it can be concluded that a majority of the state meet. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> That they actually did not mind and the condition that there was (theft of a debt of the State), were actually satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Otherwise I can not explain that 3,413,497 voters failed to vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 ODS voters elected a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52.16% of the rightful voters. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Which is a majority. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> When the above parties I add 1,016,829 voters CSSD, then the old order (because all these parties participated in the &quot;looting&quot; a debt of the state), then this condition actually agreed rightful 64.23% of voters. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> This fact, the majority of voters made ​​it clear that they are not to punish the guilty looting and over-indebtedness of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Or maybe you think that the members of the Social Democrats, who was involved planting of appropriate laws? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> We even help? </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Olomouc opens in the center of a public skating rink </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Organizer Olomouc Christmas market and ice skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work on the ice rink was launched on the 26th October and from the center is operating unit for the production of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and into Friday morning, the area will be ready for the first visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> Ice rink has an area of ​​375 meters square, took the podium 358 meters square. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Skaters and passers-by will be available two stalls with a punch. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> &quot;We have expanded our floor space, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the whole area of the stage is covered so that skaters can comfortably footwear needed,&quot; said Spálený. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Street Olomouc longer resemble the upcoming Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Last year, the rink for repair of Lower Square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall on the Upper Square. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Correction of Lower Square was completed in late summer, so that the ice surface could return back to its original place. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> For the first time people could go ice skating in front of City Hall in 2009, when it was a skating rink in operation from January to March. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> The ice surface will then become an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Christmas markets, which includes a rich cultural program will be launched on the Upper Square month before Christmas Eve. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Scientists more light on how the tail movements related to the dog&apos;s mood </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wagging tail to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while nervous dogs tail waving mostly to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But now scientists say that other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail to record a response. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;With men it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different binding to the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The same thing we tried to be observed in other species. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> He added that, as is the case in humans and dogs the right side of the brain responsible for the left-hand movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> In order to get more information about how dogs respond to asymmetrical tail wagging of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals watched movies about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes goes their tail to one side, and sometimes on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Professor Vallortigara said, &quot;we projected dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of silhouettes - to get rid of any confounding stimuli, and we are also able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1603"> When the animals saw otherwise lackluster dog move his tail to the right (from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail) remained completely calm. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> But when he saw the shooting tail largely left (again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), their heart rate increased and the animals she was unsure. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Professor Vallortigara said he does not think that dogs through these movements consciously communicate with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Rather, it believes that the dogs have learned from experience, that the movement must and you need not to pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He said: &quot;If you meet several dogs and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior, you respond to this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Researchers say the findings may dog owners, veterinarians and cvičitelům help better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> An expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, a high school teacher veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side for dogs is important. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned away his head to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and right when looking at the cheerful dog. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> A specialist in another paper by the University of Victoria in Canada said: &quot;The dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when the tail wagging the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite compared to the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The difference may be due to him that the dogs in the different studies animals in movies or dog robots landings quite like dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> He explained that it could help the study of how dogs react to real dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> &quot;Although in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> But given how easy it is to record their behavior, probably will not be long before you understand why sometimes their tail goes one way and sometimes the other. </seg>

<seg id="1630"> Banks are combing years old instant messaging and e-mails to find it in case of violations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Investigation reports alarmed traders in the region, which was one of the biggest engine for making profits in the investment bank closings in recent years, but that was disrupted by a small volatility of currencies limited the opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they claimed that the large and highly liquid market for foreign currency is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior marketers say that this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> A senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign exchange trading dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing use their own internal platforms means that &quot;you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1635"> The bank immediately drew the attention of the relevant authorities and cooperating with the regulatory authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1661"> &quot;But the desire to show everyone he&apos;s still in me,&quot; reports the determination. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Maybe we will see, it is supposedly the New York Rangers, who failed to enter into the season and they have injured two pillars - the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> How did you came to the Rangers look like? </seg>
<seg id="1664"> It&apos;s just speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Until I have something on paper, so it is not worth to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> I know that there was an article in the New York Post, that I should sign, but that&apos;s all. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> It was never delivered, that this really happened. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Unfortunately, myself, would like to announce that I have a contract, but it just is not so. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Do not you heard nothing from the club? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Such communication takes place every day in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> There goes about getting into a situation where the contract really matter. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> When a player to be injured or to someone not a mančaft struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> There are many different factors that must meet together to get the contract. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> But in New York, just like circumstances occur, right? </seg>
<seg id="1675"> Injury is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team came out entry into the season, so there is some chance, do not you think? </seg>
<seg id="1676"> Of course, the chance is always. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> The second thing is that we always need two sides. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> I would today take a lot of offers, but so far I did not get one. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> This is unfortunately the reality in which we live. </seg>

<seg id="1935"> Ostrava Mayor Kajnar Cancer in the CSSD is not me </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Before the election was fully ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava CSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> All this culminated when the mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar go to court because of the undemocratic assembly candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> Actors cases to it still did not want to speak too, that the parties before the elections even more damage. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Now they are the voices of voters numbered. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Keeping in Ostrava and the Social Democrats on Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava to secede from the side, and will probably push on it to come on their function. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Petr Kajnar but wants to keep fighting. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> What goes in disputes and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview with the Journal. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> How do you feel about the outcome of elections? </seg>
<seg id="1944"> CSSD certainly allowed for a much better result. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Harm her with us to the address before the elections in the media disputes within the party? </seg>
<seg id="1946"> I imagine that social democracy could have a better election result. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> It is a party which has its own internal problems, is intrinsically ill and people perceive that it is not all right. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> In the elections to make it clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> What are the internal medicine CSSD? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Decline for some time passes me by ODS and things like that now, unfortunately taking place in social democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Is it that lobbyists influential people who previously had expected that their benefices find at ODS, moved to the people in the CSSD and have an impact. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> It is related to the fact that the offices of the Municipality of Ostrava police come and collect your computer. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It shows that the CSSD is not made up only of people who would like the benefit of others, but many of them are thinking of the good of his own. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps and Prague, as seen in the current power struggle between Haskovec and Sobotkovci. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> I have to be prepared but long. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> That&apos;s what happened before the elections in Ostrava, was a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Hašek wing gradually occupied a position to then after the election could cause a situation that weakens Sobotka wing. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> People in politics in a situation where sometimes have to compromise. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> Everyone has an inner boundary but when it compromises you do not go, and that&apos;s my case. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Originally I did not want to stand in the House, but when I perceived the whole thing within the party, so I made ​​a deal with Lubos Zaorálek I&apos;ll try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen as mayor of Ostrava Sobotka right wing. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Hašek wing but it could stop. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Why stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hasek? </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Mussels Sobotka to me is a man who always speaks primarily about the CSSD and to some extent for the vision for the party and for the country. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> I admit that the other side heard anything like that. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Michal Hašek just fighting for power. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I do not understand how the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the executive committee, just start undoing the party chairman. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It is a struggle for power no matter what, and against the statutes party. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> I think what we now Michal Hašek performed in Prague, he ended his political career. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> How did you perceive that you Ostrava CSSD leadership to the candidate did not approve. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Political parties are based on the competition, who are both members of their places. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> The competition should be largely based on program vision and the ability of the people to fulfill the vision. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Of course, however, this Voice of the people who power or ability to have a vision, but the party is for them a lift to the money you would get elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The problem is when these people start to the fore because unscrupulous infringers violate the statutes of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Their practices make the political parties and the Mafia by me and also violate the laws of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> Alert on this issue is more important to me than to take account of whether a Kajnar has a political future. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> It is important that the parties began to respect the statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Therefore, you are then brought before the election proposal to the court for an injunction against the form of the ballot CSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region? </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The current county executive committee CSSD in Ostrava consolidate his power by organizations that do not fit, he can cancel the new purpose-based organization, gradually throws party members uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Example of this is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik of the club representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then resolution to exclude rather canceled. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> This shows that claim adherence to the parties before the court, although the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD stopped working, it&apos;s the only option. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The management of the Ostrava Social Democrats, headed by deputy Adam Rykala is revoked you from the position of Mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> It is an open secret that this post has a crush mayor Poruby Lumír Palyza. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> That&apos;s right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza trying to do everything so that I could appeal. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> They promise to rank people, get votes and then the voices strengthen their power in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> When you return to the past and everything that happened to be around the football club Banik Ostrava stadium and purchase Bazaly was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It was artificially staged to me could be described as a person who gives money where it does not belong. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> In doing so, the city bought the property to him strategically a great value. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> How do you see it move on with their remaining as mayor? </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The district committee had me and another on Monday urged people to consider whether to remain in the CSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> But I think that it&apos;s as if the thief shouting: To Catch a Thief! </seg>
<seg id="1992"> Looking at the results of my work for the last eleven years, so I do not see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and enforced, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developing things like industrial zones or expansion of scientific-technological park. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Despite all this I become uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> I do not read it differently than that You interfere with others, came to the place they desire. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> We will therefore these efforts still somehow fight? </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Since when has this republic to function well, it must work well on political parties. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state, he can not drive or herself. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> I do not speculate, therefore, that I now retired from the Social Democrats, because I think that whoever causes cancer this side, not me, but these people who are trying to vyštvat me. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> We want to show that the city can still win, promises Rajtoral </seg>
<seg id="2000"> It&apos;s a bit of a paradox. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> While his team is primarily profit lately fail, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plzen František Rajtoral the form that earned him after a return to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> He&apos;s doing well shooting, and bursting with activity after surgery it was in the game in Teplice ordered a penalty kick. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Viktoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia Prague and Teplice to win, but at the end of the two duels took a single point. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> František Rajtoral believes his team in the game against Jablonec unpleasant series of breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> We want to show that we can win. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> &quot;I believe that Jablonec home defeat,&quot; promises František Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Crew is difficult to match the Severočechy who play attacking football, carefully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Everything points to the game against Jablonec coach prepared us well, as always, we draw a lot from videorozboru game opponent. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> &quot;I believe that on Friday evening will be a great match,&quot; Czech representative attracts fans to the stands Doosan Arena. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Pilsen last matches did not work out the way she wanted, but the word crisis defender Victoria refuses. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> So it goes in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> But the crisis would in any case not speak. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> &quot;I believe that we will win on Friday and again it will be good,&quot; said defender Západočechů. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> Victoria&apos;s team will again rely on the support of fans. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> &quot;The game is played on a Friday night and I would like our fans, who are great to invite.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2016"> &quot;I believe that they repay win,&quot; adds Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Defend academic freedom, this is true for Zemana and ODS. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> I have repeatedly in recent months called an open letter to students, educators, and management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend the academic freedom of the electoral campaign, conducted by the school president Miloš Zeman. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> I met with more or less success. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to lecture honorary chairman SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, for even received retribution in the form of uninvited to celebrate the National Day of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Here is a list of school officials, who have been so brave and visit Milos Zeman to: University of Technology, Hladnov High School in Ostrava, University of Ostrava Business, Business Academy in Cologne, University of JE Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Now in Pardubice encounter with the continuation of the policy of universities. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The newly elected MP for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic positions and, moreover, he seems normal. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Sir, this really is not the same as if you stayed example, the mayor of a small city. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> We want to be the captains of the Social Democrats, who vykovávají capacity as a deputy governor and as they degrade both professions? </seg>
<seg id="2026"> This is telling people that they can handle both of these features challenging left back. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> I know we have an example of Michal Hašek, who even manages dozens of features at once. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> But this probably is not the example of a person that you should follow. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> We find the opposite and positive example MD. Štěpánky Frank, who prefer to leave the deputy&apos;s post to be able to fully concentrate on the management of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of Dean, however, is that the dual functions violate apolitical campuses of the University of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Leadership in Pardubice ODS sees your current action at both positions as a benefit for the University. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;Their&quot; school, however, you will be able to help without even staying dean. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> I think a similar view as mine and rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Consider therefore still his resignation and keep your face. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Otherwise, you may find that you to voters in the next election are counted. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> And it does not take long. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> John Kerry admitted: Spying gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="2038"> The United States sent in spying sometimes &quot;too far&quot;, he admitted according to AFP chief of American diplomacy John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> Collection of information by the Minister but served to prevent terrorist attacks. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> &quot;The first returns from Washington,&quot; according to AFP sounded in the middle of intense controversy on both sides of the Atlantic because of scandalous revelations about mass data monitoring by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which has also become the target of U.S. allies. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> &quot;In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that it does not happen in the future,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In the interview, but also defended current practice. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> The collection of information is necessary according to him, the fight against terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, bombings in Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> &quot;We prevented the fact that the plane fell, the building exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed of lying in wait,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> However, again admitted that the collection of information &quot;in some cases went disproportionately far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> The scandal around U.S. intelligence, which reportedly watched by hundreds of millions of telephone calls, broke out in Europe this month. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Among other things, showed that Americans watched and mobile phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> European leaders did not hide their indignation and some of them urged the European Union to the United States to try to reach an agreement that would monitor zapovídala or significantly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Royal Commission heard that before lawsuits against Jonathan Lord two employees were accused young men Christian Association (YMCA) </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Royal Commission on the sexual abuse of children learned that before the accusations against the child educators Jonathan Lord from the city Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Young Men Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> But before the commission was said that in his opening statement to the association stated that your organization has ever resolved the case of sexual abuse of a child. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case when one of the employees of the YMCA accused of offenses relating to child pornography, and on the other, the gym teacher at the YMCA Caringbah in 1991 was convicted of sexual abuse of children which he had in his care . </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, advisor committee that he knew about the first case, but the second is not. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> He admitted that the opening statement, the YMCA was also inaccurate when announcing that the YMCA is conducted external audits, which valued the organization as a leading advocate of children&apos;s rights. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Evidence before the Commission talks about the YMCA was advised that the audit of the Ministry of Education and the Office of August this year, received the second lowest of four possible ratings. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Mr. Hare, who began working with the Association of YMCA when he was 21, he admitted that the leadership itself from him down failed when Mr. Lord has taken, without making sure that your staff is aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Earlier this year, the Lord convicted for sexual harassment 12 boys committed during the two years when he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> He was jailed for a minimum of six years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> Mr. Hare but rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff to report security breaches children, Mr. Lord. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Members of staff gave evidence that they were witnessing such breach, including that the Lord was with the children alone, privately guarded them, let them sit with me on his lap, he said to them that he loves them, and let them play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Danielle Ockwellová, which was subordinate to the lord and asked for training children&apos;s safety because she worried about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barn, head of services to children in the YMCA in Caringbah, which was Lordovým supervisor was &quot;very intimidating and often was difficult to talk to him about something. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2062"> The Director General said that the evidence does not accept the staff that make you feel uncomfortable if they had contacted his superiors and deeds report. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, and therefore did not report the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Mr. Hare said that the Board of the YMCA in New South Wales said its view that the lessons of the &quot;case of Jonathan Lord&quot; for the organization lies in the fact that the staff &quot;did not have a message,&quot; a council with him as agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Mr. Hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after an allegation made ​​general manager for services to children in the YMCA Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> He said that the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence, but was &quot;overly zealous&quot; and poorly made. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> An expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not in the years 2009-2011 the organization that would be safe for children. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> He said that there will be serious problems in recruiting, screening, implementation, training and management of personnel. </seg>

<seg id="2077"> FAA: Air passengers can now use in aircraft technology gains (but not make calls from their mobile phones) </seg>
<seg id="2078"> The passengers of the airlines will be able to use their electronic devices &quot;from gate to gate&quot; - except calls from their mobile phone - reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules on Thursday issued a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA ). </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Passengers but do not expect changes occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> How quickly will the change will be introduced by different airlines, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Airlines will be required to manage FAA to demonstrate how their aircraft comply with the new rules and updated training manuals for cabin crew and guidelines for storage facilities in order to comply with the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> FAA stated that since some airlines received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Among the companies that have sent the plans are Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;Depending on the condition of such a plan can improve widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,&quot; FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> At present, the passenger is required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> They can not be turned on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 km and the captain issued the permit. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Since passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane drops to land, and do not turn them until the aircraft is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Under the new rules, the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference, allowing its passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, said FAA. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> Since most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers could use the Wifi at higher altitudes, it is expected that meets these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Laura Gladingová, president of the Association of Professional stewards, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> &quot;Once the new rules introduced safely - and we stand with transport companies we work closely - it will be a success,&quot; she said in a statement Gladingová. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> Have us frankly tired look as &quot;watchdogs&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will remain below 3 km altitude prohibited, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Passengers will be advised that their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched to air mode. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> So still no Words with friends, online scrabble type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off your device when the aircraft was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> A heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that could hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Calls from mobile phones will remain on board prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify FAA, but the U.S. Federal Bureau of Telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> FAA may in some electronic devices during takeoff and landing lift the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Last month Mark Rosenker of the National Committee for Transportation Safety, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> &quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because it can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but data from the FCC, we also know that the air can cause interference to broadcast towers,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A business advisory committee created by the administration of FAA therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The FAA has in recent years been pressured to ease the restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Critics like Senator Claire McCaskillová, Democrat of Missouri, said that there is no valid security reason for this ban. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Restrictions have also become more difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers may forget to turn off their devices duty or ignores it. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of the navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry a FM radio, a technical achievement at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems of aircraft than previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic jamming. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Airlines for several years, offering passengers using Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The vast majority of airlines would be under the new rules should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting, than it was for previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> For example, the electronic reader issue when turning pages only minimal transmission. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> But broadcasting is stronger when the machine download or upload data. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Among those pushing for it to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> In 2011, representatives of the company loaded airliner with its Kindle electronic reader and perform a test flight, but no problem reappeared. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Members of the Advisory Committee FAA expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Douglas Kidd of the National Association of airline passengers said he is confident that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> Other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of these reports is very old. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots ordered the passengers off the device during instrument flying in low visibility. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> Group tourism industry has welcomed these changes and goes by her sensible approach to the traveling public that the technology used in abundance. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security,&quot; said Roger Dow, executive director of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> In an unprecedented admission John Kerry said that the U.S. intelligence had &quot;gone too far&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2124"> John Kerry suggested softening of the U.S. position regarding the defense of their monitoring programs and an unprecedented confession said that in some cases, espionage &quot;gone too far&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama responsible for that, with regard to the incendiary revelations about the NSA spying, which emerged from the informant Edward Snowden, acted as the &quot;autopilot&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> Mr. Kerry via video-link on open government conference in London said: &quot;There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government we actually learned about some of the things that the inertia guns, because there was the possibility, with reference the Second World war, the difficult period of the Cold War and of course the 11th of September. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2128"> He was thus the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government, who admitted that U.S. intelligence crossed the border, but stressed that it was not violated anyone&apos;s rights. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> He said: &quot;In some cases, this has gone too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> A president&apos;s decision to try to explain it to people and clarify and now conducts a thorough examination, that no one had the feeling that there was abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA organization seeks good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> He added: &quot;We also face a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2562"> The new civil code prepared by six of the ten companies </seg>
<seg id="2563"> On approaching the efficiency of the new Civil Code and the Law on Corporations 1 January 2014 was gearing up six out of ten companies. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Only eight percent of the interviewed company representatives said that matters relating to the two key codes in their company did not address at all. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It results from a survey Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech firms. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> In connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of the two key codes can only just at the last moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> The biggest changes in private law for the last 50 years is, in our opinion, affect all citizens and businesses in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> Because of maneuvering politicians lived long in the business sector uncertain about whether the revolutionary changes ultimately will or not. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> &quot;Now they are left with only a few weeks to go to the new law passed for their company without complications,&quot; commented partner Ambruz Dark Deloitte &amp; Legal Jan Spáčil. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Of the 61 percent of companies heavily engaged in new Labour 26 percent said that their companies had taken all the necessary steps to be ready in time. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> In addition, 35 percent of companies that number is going to take the necessary measures in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Against this, every fifth company recodification not yet been addressed, but has definite ideas about how to prepare for them. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Overall, 11 percent no opinion and fails to consider the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Only eight percent of companies admit that issues related to the recodification not been addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of surveyed companies signing new contracts (21 percent), followed by resolution of commercial conditions (16 percent) and changes in the real estate and the responsibility for the damage (ten percent). </seg>
<seg id="2576"> For contracts takes place one of the most important news across recodification, editing and union contracts only under the new Civil Code. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> Current parallel adjustment in the Civil and Commercial Code shall expire, with the result that the contract law should stand for citizens and businesses easier. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;For entrepreneurs new legislation will offer many new products with emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations,&quot; said the lawyer Ambruz Dark Deloitte &amp; Legal Luke subjects. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In connection with the Business Corporations Act deems the most important topic almost a quarter said the issue of increasing the liability of statutory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Then there are issues related to changes in the convening and conduct of general meetings (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent). </seg>
<seg id="2581"> New legislation is stricter obligations and potential impacts to the statutory authorities, particularly in a situation where companies threaten to bankrupt or gets into it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> &quot;In practice this means that if members of boards of directors and executives of companies do not act with due diligence and avert imminent bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit obtained for the performance of their duties until the last two years,&quot; said Spáčil. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Revealed NSA increasing social paranoia monitoring by the State </seg>
<seg id="2584"> One peaceful day to the end of August the German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of roofs American outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> German media claims that the Office BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and this action launched in Berlin exchange between the American and the German foreign minister. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, in September again insisted that the United States used its foreign intelligence capabilities, &quot;to steal trade secrets for the benefit of foreign companies and U.S. companies to strengthen their international competitiveness and increase their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2588"> But since then, the Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and business leaders already know, if they believe the words of the director. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied in the Brazilian oil company, gained access to data under the control of U.S. Cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo reached a general paranoia about the state tracking new dimensions. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The final straw came with the revelation that the phone Chancellor Angela Merkel was maybe ten years old bugged. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certainly potential targets and business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Snowden made ​​translucent intense collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> I would say that it is possible that the data is used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, president of bits, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> According to a survey published in July advisory service EY German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now represents as great a risk as China. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Throughout the documentation revealed Mr. Snowden but so far there is no evidence that the United States passed on trade secrets foreign firms in their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain skills in IT and the Internet, and said they should seek to reduce its dependence on the USA: </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Business leaders are skeptical towards it. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> From the German Parliament, the voices that we should make the German Google. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> I can just close my eyes and opened them again slowly ... </seg>
<seg id="2601"> That is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, it did 20 years ago, let it die. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Everything but the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies discovered Snowden is for some companies who still believed that the greatest threat is the monitoring of China, yet shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Now is a great turnover in cloud computing, where European leaders in a broad range realized that the data stored in the U.S. fall under local jurisdiction, and are therefore potentially open to challenge. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> According to a survey carried out by the business community Cloud Security Alliance about 10 percent of non-US members after unveiling the USA Prism data mining abandoned plans to use cloud provider based in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, said: &quot;We have a new question for customers who have not been here before - where my data is stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction remain physically?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Many high-ranking German officials argue that the latest messages are just confirming what we already knew: that powerful nations want to steal their most precious secret, and this data must be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> That is carried out economic espionage is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> It always happened. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> &quot;It is a vital topic for many years and will not change significantly even during the current debate,&quot; said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Agrochemical company. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Americans we conducted espionage on commercial and industrial level, as we carry out spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Enterprise leaders generally do not want to brag too countermeasures that have made that possibly not provided by the attacker advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> In the case of large companies have a long history recalls that marry the fair free USB memory drive or leave unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board carmaker Audi said that for many years it is common practice to collect before the meeting of the Board of cell phones, they can not be used as a listening device. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The German office BfV managers like to consider whether not to use when traveling abroad easy prepaid cell phones because of the risk that smart phones can embezzle. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Prepaid cell phones are then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to hacking and tracking vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> &quot;Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,&quot; he warns in his report BfV. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> USA his own company warns of economic espionage from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> According to the Washington Post cited U.S. National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France, in addition to Russia and Israel in the second row offenders who engage in hacking activities for economic newsletters, ranked behind China. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Member of the board in risk-free German company concluded that in terms of economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, this month in an interview said: &quot;The service is completely know very well that all countries, although they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, espionage carried out to its allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2626"> New vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasures of smoking </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasures of smoking cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect life mouse to dependence on nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before testing on humans is necessary to perform additional tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical Faculty in New York, says that early indications are good. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> &quot;We hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have exhausted all methods available in the market today, but found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that the current approaches overcome all,&quot; said professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information to create antinikotinových antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to create a steady stream of these antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Antibodies persecute any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get to the brain, thereby preventing the smoker get the nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> In tests vaccinated mice were subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> But the mice that were not vaccinated, &quot;calm&quot;, said the researchers, which is a sign that they had received nicotine to the brain. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Experimenty jsou popsány v časopise Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> Previous tobacco vaccine have failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The injections have to be administered as frequently to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, however proved expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because the liver cells to convert factories antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Professor Crystal said that if future vaccine for humans will be completely safe, could be given to children before they have the taste of a cigarette a try, and would avoid the addiction to nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> More likely, it would not have used smokers to quit. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> &quot;They know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine that will have no benefit, and it will help them kick the habit,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The desperate cry of the Obama voters </seg>
<seg id="2645"> I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope of a possible change </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He says that Obama&apos;s sincere efforts to stymie the obstruction of the Republican Party </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Obstruction can not excuse woes websites Obama health care or unmanned attack aircraft </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Memoirs of the Obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Nathaniel P. Morris second year studying medicine at Harvard. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> These days I read terribly sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> About this book, I thought that I was in the bleak days of my second year of medical school to encourage and restore in me a pinch of hope. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (boldness to win) and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> When I finish the evening opinions of patients and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches will take your breath away. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Election ended overwhelming and television news are forcing us to think about the historical value of this moment. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> My classmates wept with joy and my parents hid the newspaper he could find. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The White House team headed young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> During the inauguration in 2008 had 82 percent support Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> And here I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Jump to the present is harsh awakening like to discuss with a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> It&apos;s hard to commemorate those optimistic days - they seem distant memories, sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> In the years after I threw my first ballot, really has changed. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> It was certainly nothing of what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> I recognize that Obama achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law of care available through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the policy of &quot;Do not ask questions, to say nothing&quot; after the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstruction reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: the other is that immigration reform, public option to choose health care and the closure of Guantánamo. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> But in many situations where I had colleagues and friends defended the Obama administration, I respect the explanations that can provide, reached the absolute limit. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> I found myself in the place of political hopelessness. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Obstruction of the Republicans can not explain the agreement with intercepting foreign leaders or the drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Unable to explain to them that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that persecutes those who expose government misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> They can not be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakího, an American citizen, without trial or for limiting public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> They can not justify the report&apos;s findings, saying that White House efforts to silence the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A recently nor excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the Act of care available to a simple website. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> I do not know whether something like this could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Whether I had 18 years to suspect that the power of government may be in conflict with political campaigns that preceded it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Elected office obviously has a predictable course and our public conversations will shape the opposition political party and random events, such as the massacre in Newton. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> However, all of the examples I mentioned above, to a large extent seem to be the result of his own administration&apos;s decision. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> And that bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Mitt Romney presented a confusing nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be unable to consolidate its policy or position. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, which we had heard. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Nevertheless, it is a return to 2008 - with how support for Obama this week fell below 45% - through this book becomes increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It makes me remember the series of promises that are lost. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> This week I read a chapter in a book about how Obama during the primaries in Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> The additional meeting during the campaign he told his staff that he had to get back up to speed and stay true to our mission. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;I want to back our magic,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> We must not forget who we are. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Five years later, Mr. President, and totally agree with you. </seg>

<seg id="2736"> Early puberty: Mature earlier </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Research has shown that Afro American and Latina reach puberty earlier than their White peers. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Physical changes do not mean that approaching puberty </seg>
<seg id="2739"> There is no evidence that for these hormones or other chemicals </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Experts say that one of the starters earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Should the mother horrified when her daughter begin to grow breasts and pubic hair in 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2744"> At the annual meeting of the American Academy of paediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida explains pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes among American girls are quite common and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> &quot;A lot of time was spent by my parents assured that this is not usually the sign of a rapid evolution towards full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Visible signs of development, such as breast development, pubic and underarm and body odor, the girls appear earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Over the last forty years, however, was only a small shift in the age when menstruation occurs first. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> In the United States there are now an average age of 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years of age in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> &quot;When you start to develop breasts, pass a minimum of two to three years, pending the first period,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of &quot;Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem&quot; (Early puberty in girls : Essential guide for the management of this frequent problem) </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The most reliable test of how puberty will continue, it&apos;s time. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Discussion about what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if it is accompanied by the growth of breast growth spurt before 8 years of age, a girl is considered &quot;precocious&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> In most cases, the process slows down or stops - which can paediatricians carefully monitored. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist performed tests to exclude serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> There are treatments that delay the early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to cessation of growth stunting in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Recommendations on medications and hormonal therapy are dependent on the child&apos;s age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Psychosociologické are also important aspects. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> When it comes to medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that &quot;the suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems girl and her feelings of being different from their peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Of course is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters had menstruation. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> &quot;I&apos;m worried that it may become pregnant, or how it will cope with hygiene,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started having menstrual periods at age 10. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Although there were signs of menstruation and we talked, was not ready emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> She came home from school frightened and upset, that is the first of her friends. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> There are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Even though there is no coherent body of evidence that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Boys - like girls - reaching puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> In 2001 helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which connects the body fat with the timing of puberty. </seg>

<seg id="2773"> Other physicians participating in the conference of the American Association of paediatricians (AAP) have added to the complexity of this topic further. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Acne and pubic hair is common even among infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> &quot;We have to be careful as to how to identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist from Goryebské Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Parents should not hesitate to get from your child&apos;s doctor instructions on how to talk with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> &quot;It may involve the need to talk with your child earlier than expected,&quot; he Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> If you are calm, your child will probably respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Girls who develop earlier, they need assurance that even if this is done too early, the process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> October saw him by the Union of Film Distributors nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Most of the reviews assesses positively the image. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Others, however, there are some inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and if you noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> George Dusek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I love sci-fi movies that I think are modern, dreamy fairy tale. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Film Gravity is included, while acting as a &quot;physically real&quot; performance. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> No, but that does not mean it was bad. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> I enjoyed it very much. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Note the hair you need to Sandra Bullock, who somehow raises in a state of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Hubbův Space Telescope and the International Space Station after moving significantly different orbits, so they can not be seen in one shot. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Some viewers of the film accuse unrealistically acting effect and the whole fire behavior in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The suits would have also withstood such wounds. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The heroes in the movie Gravity often come into conflict with various objects and clothing without too much trouble all last. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> Critics were not spared either storyline. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> So vast tragedy in Earth orbit, according to some panelists unrealistic. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> In addition, they wonder why the doctor was sent into space to repairing equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> People on the forums arguing about &quot;unreal&quot; behavior lan. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> It is said to act like it was designed for bungee jumping. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium. Prague): I saw him not only to the wide screen, but I can definitely say I was enchanted. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I&apos;m glad it was not a documentary film, but science-fiction. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> And with such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to hold consistently reality. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> &quot;More than you mentioned discrepancies me touching it, as is shown three times the space station with the degrading level of technology (Last Chinese).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2914"> &quot;China will indeed until the end of the decade and will probably look better than the movie.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences): The computer-generated scenes, the authors successfully trying not to violate the laws of physics, so Sciences, facing the viewer will appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and crashes quite rightly maintains momentum, speaking dictionary physics, also view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including thin-skinned atmosphere and aurora flickering on the polar regions. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Irregularities are considered in detail surely find it. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Additionally, for example, when I read comments found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appear to reverse than it should in fact be (from west to east). </seg>
<seg id="2918"> George Stephen (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things filmmakers adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and egregious offense against logic or the laws of nature, I noticed in the film and in comparison with other films with similar aims is to see that the creators made a point of credibility to the events displayed. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> The moments that do not make sense worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits the otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> The result is significantly different relative speed and rescue operation would, therefore, could not in fact take place, as was shown in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> Furthermore, at the moment of separation Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I noticed that the whole ISS rotated, so it is not clear the origin of the forces acting on Kowalski, who makes both actors to undertake at the moment, when it is not moving against each other. </seg>

<seg id="2939"> We decided to attend the first flight and then focus on the update and we did. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> This will happen during the entire flight program. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> According to Bombardier, the second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other shortly thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> Analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer to start to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Bombardier claims that evaluate your plan putting the aircraft into service in the coming months and will provide updated information. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> &quot;This slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with internal company plan Bombardier - probably reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Of the U.S. $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year in the third quarter ending 30 September net profit fell Bombardier 147 million, or 8 cents per share. </seg>

<seg id="2953"> Revenue in the aerospace industry declined by 13 percent to $ 2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, said that revenue in this division grew by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion USD. </seg>
