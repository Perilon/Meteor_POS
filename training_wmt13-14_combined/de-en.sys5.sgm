<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The latter, the brennan Center for a myth, as it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada are the States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration or complicate the ballot box. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters have photo ID and proof of us-staatsbürgerschaft present. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, these laws also shortened the period for the early vote, denied the right to register as voters on election day, declared invalid and citizens of the right to vote, for which a gerichtsakte vorliegt. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006 has no us-staat required by the voters, produce a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in 2008 of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years they promoted in 34 States draft laws, with which the voters be forced to produce a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ausweiskarte as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the citizens, i.e. 21 million wahlberechtigte people no identification issued by a government of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to receive the necessary ID. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are regarded as voters who cast their vote vermehrt for democratic candidates in several countries, it is not allowed to use their identification issued by its creation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same states will allow members of fishing or jagdvereinen, choose the more for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state for the select asked for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state, introduced such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, the voters demand that your us-staatsbürgerschaft nachweisen. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, prefer the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states have laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They have also restricted the right of individuals and groups, we provide assistance to those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns to voter registration in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other States passed laws that aim to shorten the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For instance, in the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same is true for the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the white, 76% of voters were, only 46% of the electorate, the chose in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, opposed the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the veto of the democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They could limit the damage in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 States passed laws that reveal demand of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted in and see them as a clear aims to influence the 2012 results in the crucial states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A 2011 report from the brennan center shows that those states that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes represent the wahlmännergremium are needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: should be made the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The psa-test way in fact sometimes incorrect results, with false negative, but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to more hesitation the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of früherkennungstests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have the opinion of two medical specialists obtained. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that, when a nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood the formation of Metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> For men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient must be shown the extent of the risk of its cancer really made clear by him the possible options, where prostatakrebse untreated, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases rather opting for an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> For many men, in which you have cancer detected, no treatment place today because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active monitoring and offers you a treatment in progression of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="68"> We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for urology movember has developed an instrument, with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of psa-tests. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: http:// ca.movember.com/FR/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;if there were no more smokers, this would value at least 50% increase,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian krebsgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It seriously damages the health of people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers,&quot; regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> In accordance with the Canadian krebsgesellschaft fördern overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm- mastdarm- speiseröhren- bauchspeicheldrüsen- and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life against grimmdarmkrebs protects,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too much of it increases the risk of developing a grimm- bzw. mastdarmkrebs. </seg>
<seg id="93"> meats should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by räuchern, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitaminzusätzen and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But their investigations are currently not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> After the Canadian krebsgesellschaft are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> During a study the reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another more of an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> shown the effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family vorbelastung. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;the implementation of a früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The higgs-boson analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the likely discovery of the higgs-bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> We believe in fact that this boson in nothing less than the mechanism is involved, who is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And it is, after all, the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best or &quot;least wrong&quot; explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted, but empirically has not been observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the standard model predicted higgs-boson strongly resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week on a large physik-kongress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to agree to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Nevertheless, we expect that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is a low risk to deceive, and we take a look at what it is about. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world there is a necessarily unumgängliches law meant that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to break this rule - and try not to strong, because they will hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli&apos;sche ausschlussprinzip that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, when they are in the same &quot;quantenzustand&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; largely consists of some of its properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens, which are called fermione and artig obey the pauli-prinzip. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in another move the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The particle adventure these bosons are grouped according to the website of the BERKELEY laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the &quot;kraftteilchen spread,&quot; by the great forces of nature and with which the higgs-boson somehow would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It has to be stressed, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as expected. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read these chronik, then only thanks to a bosons uitzonderlijke banality: the photon, or the &quot;lichtteilchen,&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge up or change the direction,&quot; disrupted &quot;the electromagnetic field that is in this place, like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolettstrahlung etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons &quot;carrier of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> stabileres field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the higgs-boson, with the difference that a different field, the higgs-feld, must be &quot;disturbed&quot; so that this boson shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the higgs-feld much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock zerfurcht could be. </seg>
<seg id="126"> A giant particle accelerator as CERN is therefore necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all particles interact with the same higgs-feld: those who do, have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For what all this research now &quot;may well be&quot; asks Mrs plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science they serve the review of the standardmodells (sm), and also enable physicists to look closely at all the variations between the observations and predictions of sm. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also many physicists, the eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and the model plug some holes. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It has to be said that the latter is great shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the schwerkraft (ups!) and the dark matter, ups, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, the CERN derartige abweichungen not found until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-laboren not suspected that their work would cause such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the bell labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a &quot;laborspielerei&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> applications also can also arise from all the instruments, surrounded the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the look a small light sensor developed. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras around the world today as &quot;eye&quot; and introduced him 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really never know it can... </seg>
<seg id="146"> palliativpflege - the best way to die... | Le devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> With your committee for &quot;Death with Dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of lebensendes. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, is still a lot to do in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le devoir has tried to look more closely at this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago lebte Mr L. still alone in his apartment in The montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, aufzehrte him, had left him a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed,&quot; he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois in beloeil liegend, in which he arrived on the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;however, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from running alone to go to the bathroom and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> sitting at the table before a tasty lunch, he resigniert agrees to help eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> brave succeed him even to smile and to speak with the foreign, working around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating,&quot; he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;in the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt,&quot; says Pierre brodeur, psychologe victor-gadbois at the home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Return to the kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person to take a step backwards,&quot; he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because according to several people who work in the palliativpflege, find big events in the midst of this backward steps. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois eingewiesen, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> You have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage you will by the doctors and nurses who care about you, no longer showered with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear,&quot; deliberately and by erstickung &quot;to die. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But by the disease I really got to know my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wish more in life,&quot; she says, before you accept that you set up a mask that helps her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> They expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> At the home victor-gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers care and assistance in the food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliativpflege will be used, if there are no other options more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To the deaths more pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, on 11.700 inhabitants a bed for the palliativpflege. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, if you take into account that one day we all will die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here is the live under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. christiane neustrie, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It grants the dying according to a mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar level. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer served, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help relatives and patients alike,&quot; berichtet pflegedirektorin Nathalie savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At the home victor-gadbois is not a day as the others. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition, an old man of 93 of the last familienzusammenkunft in court, and well supported by his pillow, while his honor anstößt, a young man dies of 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;for six months, three to five beds are always with cancer patients aged less than 45 years belegt shares,&quot; Dr. christiane neustrie concerned with. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the home victor-gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> problem of access to palliativpflege </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no special access to palliative care, i.e. to care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisations, such as the home victor-gadbois and the society for domestic palliativpflege in the greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This is the big flaw in the healthcare quebecs ensures that several palliativpflege specialized doctors look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> for the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliativpflege as Dr. Balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr. christiane neustrie, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to quality palliativpflege have accepted, before we move on to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was, without having taken measures to their relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And, at the same time several oncologists treat their patients despite schlimmster forecasts verbissen until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has aborted a difficult chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> As I told my onkologin, that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I abandons the fight, told you. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was at the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotente care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. neustrie believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, thank the staff that it has not granted this request, after their pain from a team of palliativpflege have been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be made clear that the palliativpflege in the schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After elsie monereau, head of the society of the domestic palliativpflege palliativpflege 8% of patients not to speak in the greater Montreal area a schmerzbehandlung. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life are the doctors, often back to the terminals sedation, the gist of which the patients either sporadic or permanently until the date of his death einzuschläfern. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity, in this terminale sedation zurückzugreifen. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients whose pain not be soothed, all say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean,&quot; I want them to be eased without me,&quot; but &quot;I want to see my pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalismusstipendiums Canadian gesundheitsforschungsinstitute. </seg>
<seg id="212"> immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> officials of the bauhauptgewerbes straßenbauamtes, businesses, geldbeschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia erzählen every day, what you know about a great &quot;system&quot; in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry,&quot; the Quebec was very expensive for the taxpayer, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange how the system is falling apart, since then it has taken drastic measures,&quot; witzelt Jacques duchesneau, a Member in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was exposed by him because a thorough investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties to straßenbauarbeiten in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed. </seg>

<seg id="276"> At the time, I had just recovered from a verletzungsserie. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season of psg? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of the spitzenreiters Lyon us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the first knockout round in this way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the goal of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>

<seg id="286"> First of all we want to first of our group in Porto, so that we can complete the second leg of the achtelfinales as home. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the psg in the short term, a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has the budget for... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to be a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for himself in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially is the psg the resources, so that this project takes concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really close to our hearts, this title abzusahnen. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory davonzutragen. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have concluded with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally should be master with 79 points... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux to win the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff to him. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media too much of the psg expect? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept the perfect. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we in a home game against troyes 4-0 win, and it still is, something you can accuse us, this is certainly something frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with 4-0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona. </seg>

<seg id="311"> A team builds up over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> shown in the Champions League we have strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons is unable to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge spending. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed you to spielpause with 15 points ahead! </seg>
<seg id="315"> This means that our opponents and ignored the French championship would. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not good, from this new psg &quot;geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling winner and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The psg seems completely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic abhängig to be. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, that speaks of a &quot;zlatan-abhängigkeit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is really powerful and scores many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done, is really extraordinary. </seg>

<seg id="335"> This was for my baptism with the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The nationaltrainer is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to make no comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its aim, by he had qualified for the European championships. </seg>

<seg id="349"> With bitcoin pay and sell without bank is possible </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Furthermore, as so often in these technologies is a political vision greifbar: the belief that the current, of bankmonopolen designed monetary system, leading to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, this is of satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange like bittorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions recorded. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand webseiten accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the course of bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, before he has recovered today to around $10 to $2 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly impressive in relation to the world trade of real currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that are used to move forward in a video game that you win or play with (and sometimes zurücktauschen) can buy. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, the trade is controlled by a central authority and each time bearbeitet. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With bitcoin are all netzknoten gleichzeitig repositories of the rechnungsbuchs, auditors, geld-emittenten and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose a different address for every payment, ensuring the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of the associated with this transaction data will electronically through a double verschlüsselungssystem signed. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded in the entire network widespread rechnungsbuch of public accounts are available. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task which started on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary zentralbankier, has the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computer &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole &quot;zerhackt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning) ergibt. </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this number was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions verknüpft, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user wants to cheat Two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is no link, because both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, which has resolved the task, gets 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a hundertmillionstel teilbar, what makes some room for manoeuvre. </seg>
<seg id="380"> In addition, increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for bitcoin, have been attacked and the bitcoin-einlagen stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The vulnerability is not the actual minutes used,&quot; assured Pierre noizat just paymium has introduced, this is a company with real money for the payment and the network bitcoin uses. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, cash also these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> major players such as Wikipedia verweigern donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> By others such as the blog-plattform wordpress will accept them. </seg>

<seg id="391"> Pierre noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as transaktionsnetzwerk. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that it is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, manages the owner&apos;s identity and thus can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can be easily implemented in the traders, and the latter must no new terminals or install computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> You just need an address, a phone &quot;can be photographed and identified&quot;, is Pierre noizat plyuk, assured that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There, it is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal ausgerichteter systems be reconsidered. </seg>

<seg id="454"> To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the Head of State this House granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Egypt is now for nearly two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>

<seg id="469"> To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy Members, added. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are the moslembrüdern retentie. </seg>
<seg id="471"> It is not surprising that the article meistens adopted unanimously. </seg>

<seg id="473"> The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Finally, paragraph 2, drew all the attention, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The salafistischen parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace &quot;the principles&quot; by &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have made a stronger application possible. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good intentions and for your respect for the other members of the Egyptian society. </seg>

<seg id="484"> With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not ulema, but scholars who have been trained to become part of the French system,&quot; Alexis blouet appeased, the writing a thesis about the Egyptian verfassungstransition. </seg>

<seg id="487"> It relates in particular to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, shops. red.]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And in the future could be raised the question to what extent zivilrichter are competent to decide.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers, which he granted the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The moslembrüder argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another point of contention: the powers of the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wishes of the military is the examination of the defense budget not presented to Parliament, but a National Defence Council. </seg>

<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting at some point behind the checkout of MC Donald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days there was massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants across the United States popular fast food chains such as MC Donald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s, taco bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Yet no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether you will soon be back to the air out. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple walmart- and fast-food-beschäftigten the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy is hardly gewerkschaftlich organisiert. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, in the ausverkäufe took place in the US, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some walmart-mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work down and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branch of the chain, which targets individuals are low and middle income. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the walmart-filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why buy many of the slightly paid walmart-beschäftigten only at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the warensortiment machten Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart the goods often sell only so cheap, because the staff are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of serious conditions, for example lack of trucks or handscanner. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the protests on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases, and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution for the company health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical walmart-mitarbeiter, 9.5\ xC2$ deserves the hour, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company&apos;s wage increases on 12\ xC2 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> There are about 1.1% more than they now pay donations. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart wage increases would fully applies to the customers, kostete every purchase they only 46 cents more in the future. </seg>
<seg id="743"> per year would be the extra expenditure of just 12,39 dollars for them compared to today. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only to protests in nine States and that the company no losses bescherten. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and the next day in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, the walmart-kassen on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing huffington post that a &quot;less than five&quot; walmart-mitarbeiter the work niederlegten only &quot;another PR stunt&quot; and the action of the trade unions, which organised the protests that had happened. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests went further in New York this week, where their goal but not walmart-filialen (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and others were cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid. </seg>
<seg id="751"> jumaane Williams, a member of the New York municipal </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation in 7,25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast-food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No one was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s constantly people who complain that they have to make do with this reward and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there are the forum a comment to the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&apos;s in the 40th street and Madison avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast-food-restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food-branche. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits it standing in the way of corporate governance, this objective and gewerkschaftsmitglieder abzumahnen or dismiss. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, makes the governance you not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food-branche is difficult but also for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> noisy protests there was on this day, many other fast food options in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local democrats languages including stadtratsmitglied jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, bürgermeisterkandidat bill de blasio, who said that &quot;we should support the fast-food-mitarbeiter together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, every New York deserves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food-industrie. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, far from all of them employed in the fast-food-branche are in the tens of thousands of work in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately überlisten&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technologies popular issue of augmented reality is usually seen through the lens of a special glasses in recent times. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then know that Microsoft had such a patent pending. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d-technologies in microsoft-labor in Cambridge shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a durchgangsstation. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It&apos;s the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and virtual space to create. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please describe a brief, what research your group operates. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - we are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, humanity is largely stuck in the period in which worked with pixels on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want 5-10 years vorausblicken and predict the radical changes this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the xbox-konsole and the kinect-sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without kinect xbox, as all interested in motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - although kinect the interaction has brought on a physical level, is much still on the flat, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The entry of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change, work in a real three-dimensional darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We have the computer world in our physical world entlassen and make it fassbarer. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings is recognized. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helme Los! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - what do you think about sprachsteuerung? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it will not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It is certainly not the allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all umstehenden would like to inform about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the field of governance of objects in public places on a project, for which short and narrow, instead of spreading gesten experimentierten. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not recorded by the objektkamera, but by a bracelet, the movements of the bones and muscles registered. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But overall, the future, mixed steuerungstypen, for example, gestures and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - As? </seg>
<seg id="800"> For example - we would you ask me to give you this sprudeldose to rich? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and, at the same time it. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - oh, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - this means that they want the user can afford to adapt what a machine at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the next time we especially need to be working on the development of new sensortypen, which make it possible to capture reactions of people more. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The can, for example be lasersensoren, as they offer in depth a good resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - which claims they are on the basis of their work with the xbox kinect-sensoren on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - the current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithmen more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only the resolution along the X and y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> , the speed and the number of frames per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in redmond a berührungssensor with an adjustable verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> influenced not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For my work I needed just such a device, only without berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - the number of cameras should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - kinect is currently working with three &quot;cameras,&quot; and one of them actually a infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary rgb-kamera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the objekttiefe. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras may solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> or increase the problem as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be a flexible, kinect-ähnliches system, in which we could play with various kameraneigungen to see how we help the three-dimensional ermittlung a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - if I remember rightly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google&apos;s glasses not to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - of course it is not pleasant to keep unterwegs always collected a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste variant would be a &quot;changing&quot; augmented reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses could switch to the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an augmented reality through glasses prevents you can work together with other virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony stark in iron man, but also normalsterblichen accessible. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem, to the critics frequently this idea out: there is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> The answers to your group on this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often talk of the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of sensitive perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual projektionsunterlage. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure notável true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that actually are aimed at the &quot;pictures in the air&quot; to give a robust, for example, produces the interference by some gerichteten ultraschallstrahlen is in a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but at the moment is still so weak, as pustete someone on the handballen. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also tapes for the wrist to nervenendungen effect on the fingers, which is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> It to think that it can feel what it should feel, if it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - it is a good idea, so we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another task on which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people that has to be physically located in a closed room, think that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> so far is only moderately outwit the brain, and we still have many busy years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers so attractive: on many issues we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> rosbalt continues the &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; project, dedicated to the urban dwellers, the form the vanguard of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the fine list landeten already senior representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often without recognition in Europe, in the rest of Russia to be known. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of rosbalt is the extravagant knstler kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows kirill Miller, dressed in red, the bearded one time at the Russian museum, sometimes in the summer garden, time szene-treffen or encountered at openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of kirill Miller also issued, will attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, the new myths created. </seg>
<seg id="854"> kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and early 90s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and puts a smile in the face by his presence on the street his fellow citizens, and to you for good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently snapped a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg drehorgelspieler, because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image finally. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - kirill, why are you actually always in red and not for example in yellow and Turquoise in the city on the road? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red of the compromise between artists, imageberater and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society calls everything differs somewhat from the graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But let me through my provocations with the people come into the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> any of my past provocations was an invitation to talk. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when did you know that you have to be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> were issued - at an exhibition in the palace of culture newskij, in my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I must go down this route. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognised painter then to end, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friendly with the new generation of painters, so with the representatives of the &quot;gazonewschina&quot;; it was &quot;pushkinskaya 10,&quot; and then was once end. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It attracts me to theater, to fashion, music, actually to everything except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - and all the united in your art-klinik... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a space in the pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovierungsarbeiten a musikalisch-künstlerischen club for the boheme, the House of St. Petersburg boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: n.o.m. tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project &quot;ucho van goga&quot; There came. </seg>
<seg id="872"> cast and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight shirts and also the trendy composer Igor wdowin today was one of them. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group started to play live, was from it &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of &quot;halli-galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Even the gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club &quot;griboedov&quot; have their origin in the art-klinik. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There, our employees and guests. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, as culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press, on the award was &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category of &quot;artist of the year,&quot; and that I was reached at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without making a cultural contribution to make. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your work have a unique style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly currentness and sharpness of thought. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibition with the theme of &quot;the Russian museum as clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> clowns timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier I was socially, but now it grieveth and bereitet fear, to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blurs the everything and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by we dictate that everyone fully to dress up. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now, everyone on the clothes and is based on the outer and not on the interior of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but it should in the face of spit. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception disappears through the verkleiden. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - recently we saw you in the role of urban drehorgelspielers. - a city of culture should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - can also be commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - today must be commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering. </seg>

<seg id="920"> In Moscow there are currently good advisers. </seg>

<seg id="923"> The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that you honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters, therefore, must look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Petersburg - what is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there is much more culture and an appropriate breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones can art difficult to grow up. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right. </seg>

<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; explains the laborleiter of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische problems ran, Vladimir sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without firm untergrund überschlugen the chicks wild. </seg>

<seg id="955"> The last brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, will be based on the biosatelliten &quot;bion&quot; only same-sex species are. </seg>

<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space you could not solve so far. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>

<seg id="968"> But women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk there was in Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious that mankind has, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our möwe flew them, and no one on earth would you can answer the following question: übersteht the space? </seg>
<seg id="972"> It is after this flight can bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, no one answered this question,&quot; says raumfahrtveteran wachtang watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after their space, gave birth to the first female kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, andrijan nikolajew, was also kosmonaut. </seg>

<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonaut to long flights, where all went well and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit,&quot; concludes kosmonaut waleri poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>

<seg id="984"> Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small ichtyander zeugnis of drop that life on the land the ocean entstieg. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid as a child is, and that it can more easily get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swim just 2 weeks go by. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget something,&quot; says babyschwimmlehrerin Marina aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While for a newborn child so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of weightlessness is the bauch- and beckenmuskulatur extremely fast back and so has the ability, the child herauszupressen. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende hilfsmittel. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The birth could also take place in a spezialkammer, for example, to the child herauszupressen. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; is the not insignificant matter of Valery poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles cannot train. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child in orbit cannot be set as an adult for training in a belastungsanzug. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is simply the lack of, which is vital for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment that we make, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world,&quot; says the head of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor pestow, advance. </seg>

<seg id="1001"> nkú-chef: control of the schwarz-systems failed by verschulden Politics </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic in connection with public contracts has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, is back in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the interview for aktuálně.cz says this is the Vice-President of the highest kontrollamtes (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, nkú), Miloslav kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us,&quot; said kala the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> To a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As negative praxisbeispiel he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called &quot;schwarz-system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister, said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would harass - so the system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and impede the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities,&quot; kala notes. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies they talked about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, under which both countries&apos; laws on public contracts were compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> So what was it in concrete terms? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> There is a parallel examination, with which we have started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is about the fact that the European legislative sets, as are, to build the national legislation on public contracts to handle. And finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this we have compared, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences say. Generally speaking, are perhaps even something &quot;strict laws in the US and perfect,&quot; but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? What is for you from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> just such a common control could help that we stop, we constantly seeking perfection of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and to exclude illegal enrichment or criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we are achieving this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that we the system in this way only with excessive paperwork burden&quot;,&quot; and those who seek loopholes in the system, have it significantly easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values remained higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech vergabegesetzes. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our nkú, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> With regard to the authorities, is the German equivalent of the nkú bundesrechnungshof, is similarly structured as both work with us and also has a College, this is just something else is formed, authorities is similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is a state, however, is that there is this Courts of Auditors in the individual States - is the German system differs from our. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The brh may only federal funding control what our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities for us, subject to the control of landesrechnungshöfe there. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards the German legislation, is the easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I would compare it without specific details reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, and you certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Perhaps that is where the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This is certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> This is still worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise you would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards the Czech legislation, which was important for your authority the revision of the vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in force, it is in our tests have not yet. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As our controls nachträglich, we must take place here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> implications we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have introduced the new instrument &quot;recognition of risks inefficiency&quot; and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - this will impact the changes of course, as the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You see the adoption of this law more positive, or the system will be burdened with further bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It can occur, however, the problem that the rules are &quot;strict&quot; and can no longer be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous Rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carriers (for example, in the case of operational programmes of regional policy, the regional council) dahingehend that any failure to comply with the vergabegesetzes amounts to a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> It makes sense, but then to make the law even tougher? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, on the real decision-making not impact. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say first of all, which way is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister recently said that allowing the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called &quot;schwarz-systems&quot; behelligen würde - what does that mean exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The schwarz-system is now banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and hinder the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He said: &quot;We can change the law and allow the thing,&quot; but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is right for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But on the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone because of formfehlern is excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing with us. </seg>

<seg id="1129"> It was clear that most are interested in cooperation with us, and enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose benefits the proceeds of the concerts against the doomsday? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the barrier bildungszentrums studeo, where we already six years together with the Association tap in jedlička-institut work. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the jedlička-instituts are regularly maintained by editors that help them in different activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the students themselves do not have the resources to the editors go, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the jedlička-instituts should create its own building in which we then move in with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Each concert treten several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> according to what criteria they have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted a program that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague treten chinaski, for example, support lesbiens illustratosphere with Dan bárta, the tap tap, marián bango and Jiří suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar &quot;events&quot; are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their auslandspläne are not just small, so far, they are already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The tap tap is, however, a group, made up of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How you manage these travel locistics and organisational? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it appears at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage. We must also, of course, many instrumentenkoffer and other luggage mitschleppen... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čsa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I am sometimes have partly been surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> By their foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, as it deals with disabled people. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> As you have seen these things? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that the East is everything still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator vorlässt. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, entstehen clubs there, are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what way we must catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things, in which we later on... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is, however, still be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities selbstständig in public space, go to the museum, toilets can use. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not just üblich, that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, where we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if major athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers from our ranks, are things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap is very popular at the moment. But if we go back a couple of years: what has it in 1998 motivated to start a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> At the time I started as a supervisor in jedlička-institut, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am musicians and ua. saxofon games, I, together with a colleague a musik-ag founded. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and with time is that as our leader, láďa angelovič is wont to say, something out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> became known the band but only in the last few years, or Am I mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that has helped us cooperation with famous singers; we have also started to campaign actively for us to. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We are aware that, if something is doing and this is not to see on the outside, their own performance in a sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the eu-fördergelder we can also do good editors, high quality equipment and u.ä.. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was their goal, it with the tap tap so far to bring? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I have felt the potential that can things in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> copied in show business today often one of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, in its own way as everything new viewed with caution and only after a long time will be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the viewers usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret müssten. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, if you have the funds to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities in something, this is a progress not only for themselves, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was for this success also helpful, that you are a strict boss, as we hear from many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you would like to do something well, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But this is, in my view, completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you find that you need to have test twice a week, vorbereitungsphasen absolvieren and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then erlischt enthusiasm in many quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> It works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the tap tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 in this? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> A single: láďa angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. The people come and go. You cannot prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and the desire on the part, is welcome at any time. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> will take place the day before the predicted Doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, Poland was on a ministerratssitzung of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as zwanzigstes Member of this space. Poland is included with the second Member State from the former eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 esa-mitglied). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several esa-projekten. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The way of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Polish kosmosbegeisterte employees with the space, but they do not always on understanding stießen. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I refer, for example, of the lecture by A.\ xC5 ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work presented &quot;entrance to the outer space exploration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born. However, 1905) made the audience cold, and after years remembered\ xC5 ternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> \ xC5 ternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the outer space exploration&quot; by Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix rep-hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of the space was ua. dadurch acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 a eisenbahn-draisine was built in Poland, for which a raketenantrieb was planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the proposal and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or to brake the draisine should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information come exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry, to deal with raketenbetriebenen floors. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the Institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw wolfke and Prof. gustaw mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the documents which that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> in 1937, in the press of dipl.eng. rohoziński stammende draft fotoelektrischen jagdrakete on, and the following year was the work of &quot;rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza leliwa-krzywoblocky&quot; of the author. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of the raketenantriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of raketentechnik from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy) coordinated. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, the war began. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> More articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the Journal problemy, in which four long articles are devoted to the space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. subotowicz contains the proposal to create a raumfahrtgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there was already the first projects for comparison, and it was clear that the Exploration of Space future would have. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Already in its beginnings in 1956 was the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was founded in 1951 in the autumn of 1956 ordinary Member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first pta-vorsitzende, Kazimierz zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> held he had this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> since 1956, the PTA maßgeblich took part in the development of highly successful meteorological rakete (rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Polish rakete for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the rm-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the rm-1a, built, and began in 1959 in the błędów-wüste flugtests with the zweistufenrakete rm-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further development should already be able to make real scientific work - the rakete rm-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of höhenwinden used. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, was the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> rm, the successor to the first missiles of the type from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte meteor-1-rakete. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was designed as zweistufenrakete, their total fraud 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> From this rakete three types have been developed (meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of transportraums for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The meteor-1a-rakete had a transportraum with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0,34 liters and meteor-1c 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude fraud in all three types 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the 1965 to 1968 was developed in luftfahrtinstitut meteor-2-rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 miles. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then, the versions meteor-2h and meteor-3 built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, on the creation of a national cospar-ausschusses followed two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland was also involved in the framework of the interkosmos-programms with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek zweiter interkosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the last week, the Constitutional Court the law on voluntary work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision gave rise to a lively debate in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting to look at the issue time from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> due to the large differences in the value of work (löhne) It comes to preisspannungen. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this term is through a state trying to understand where the manufacturers, imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition, making the competition for usurping &quot;unterbietet,&quot; with a greater market share and increase its profit. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business there. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As the capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily the spending increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is made even worse by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to replace the total economic and social damage caused by them. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practices of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce artificially the social level of their own people and thus to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly in changes to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital in particular lohnbereich. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by reducing workers&apos; rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are several years ago public lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of affected is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers such a small salary that the state must increase their income to subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees workers exposed. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures of practically all eu-südstaaten undoubtedly will amount to the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance darben on the margins of society and do hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here is, of course, the question of where this capital is? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> liberal theories and media claim that the state must not with capital involved in its own economy ad nauseam, and that planned economy lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital engstirnig insists on his position that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then we must ask if the capital the policy and to the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even beyond. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof of this is the existence of a practically ubiquitous almighty and in all States lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual bevorteilung, of legislation, is criminally punishable, but nothing in the virtually everything. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> The situation in Germany is such that a staatsministerium due to a lack of finances private, closely with the industry verflochtene rechtsunternehmen tasked with formulating gesetzentwürfen. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The violence is no longer, as the Western verfassungen announce, but of strong financial groups, from the people who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly fall into a situation, as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic at times cäsars and pompeius&apos; describes: &quot;the state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices were filled by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> against schmiergeld, through illegal erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> corruption has grown hemmungslos vote already purchased, and the people went to the election... &quot;&quot; People with character bewarben not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul... &quot;&quot; I really started talking about it, that the only medicine is a one-man rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man elected... &quot;appian thought it to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is today&apos;s society as well as in ancient times based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private sector is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Now, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the slightest seek deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look to the ruthless liberalisation of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Seen from the current state, the sinking this regime for liberal democracies can be regarded as some pause, already looming in the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> particularly disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, and witnessed the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least not permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to press down the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore systembedingt. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted politisch-soziale reforms, to increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital in society in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;nothing... that emerges from violence, or ever could arise&quot; singt sting in the song fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons do not want war, there would be no,&quot; says the dying gutele schnaper, wife of Mayer amschel Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> The a stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide and committed to the Palestinian Arabs call the State of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point, I would not write about it, who in these recurring waves of killing schuldiger and who is victims; in the end, Israel&apos;s current residents including selbstverwaltungsgebiete were born in the current political situation and have not seen the beginning of the violence itself. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is to open up the readers look behind the scenes, the look, whom the 95 years spannung (gerechnet wersji balfour-deklaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East are mainly serve. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on zugängliche historical facts, others are derived from this and go out from my own understanding of who or what group of people strongly affected the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can represent a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it really were getting these people themselves that their steps autonom certain, or whether behind the throne was someone who drew their actions to a vorbestimmtes goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time, concentrated in the wealth of the world is in the hand less individual, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not created within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomisch stands out is a particularly rich families who could be described as the head of the kraken (I do not know whether anyone else is on them, I do not exclude this but) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Much is not written about you. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) has been bought in the 1990s of the 19th century by the Rothschilds, to connect your name with hochkriminellen action to prevent, in whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and to the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, run wars or are these (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the fall of ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia in the meantime, its central bank has the Russian government unterstellt). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever has tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as the central bank, began during the civil war, launch their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> j.f. Kennedy began to launch their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; the member Louis MC fadden was poisoned after 1936 the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929, he wanted to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global machtgelüste Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert pik, a freimaurer of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was aimed, the big monarchistischen staatenwesen Europe to eliminate, by the second war should be especially broken Britain&apos;s colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world&apos;s population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would not consume as many resources for their amenities and luxury concerns and would also create a universalreligion), (the ökumenismus here is nothing more than the run-up to) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top is unleashing a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from chao - order out of the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see foundation of the Fed, so that crises such as those of you in 1907 triggered not repeat). </seg>

<seg id="1368"> The weakness of ARGO is his too widely-dispersed range, which is limited by the need to show too much in action in too many places. </seg>

<seg id="1479"> You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> They say that they want to change the Republic, but their own money you do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not particularly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have 2.5 million put into the campaign. </seg>

<seg id="1513"> And while the jury still verdutzt looked and with the achseln zuckte stapelte the cheeky Maas his exquisite mitbringsel the size to a pyramid and finished his aktionistisch untermauerte speech with the words: &quot;love stadtgemeinde!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the bücherberg spijkenisse, for the so-called boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, of the 30 million Berg aufgeschüttet. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalisierungsprojekts, belong to the garage, supermarket, post office and a few neighbouring residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the bücherberg awarded the second prize &quot;best library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 nominated. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is not the faceless kleinstadtretorte, which until now had more to offer than a postmodern pedestriansed and a stunned hässliches radnice, behind the White walls would be inclined to suspect a molkereifabrik to a piece of contemporary architecture richer. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Above all, spijkenisse now has the first public kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: büchereldorado under käseglocke. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift, the right through the hills, but the real space and lesefreuden erschließen euphonix fußläufigen climb the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The rundum verglaste interior is bright and clear, the gebrannte klinkerboden and elegant straßenlaternen speak in the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking for park bench, dog and boys and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Everywhere and books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;normally, the bücherregale along the facade, and in the middle is a big, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic raumkonfiguration on its head and the reading area from inside to outside. They </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The Interior of the bücherbergs is sent used: in the middle are offices, internet-bibliothek schachclub, umweltzentrum and haustechnikzentrale. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular pleasure is the black bücherregale, the time wandverkleidung, sometimes brüstung, sometimes stiegengeländer. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel and smell are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and bauingenieure whether of the unknown baustoffs shake their heads. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work here with recycled materials,&quot; said joop trouborst, project manager at the borough spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>

<seg id="1536"> For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes kunststoffvlies as wurzelunterlage. </seg>

<seg id="1546"> heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the bücherberg under a glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly into the interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad holzleimbinder standing across the glass, serve as a shade and catch a large part of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> fully automatic blinds. Do the Rest </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Also Lisette verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the tcm-lehrerin cynthia bogarde, the boekenberg even as spijkenisses &quot;long overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: to open a few weeks ago, each residents invited to donate a book from his personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is caught on. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think, thanks to our invitation has now each residents a certain relationship with this new House. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only to grace. </seg>

<seg id="1566"> szabo: &quot;German must play greater role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned Berlin for a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then enthielt Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> must now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But, at the same time, I believe that it not supported the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained, when it came to set up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was finally enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy switches and away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> reflected the Germans are so between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> expected of them, that you have a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think you buttons are still approach to their role, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> have a foreign policy, as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What is a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Had these interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would also not want to attach too much importance to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it plays an important role in any case in German thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by it has abstained on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that, in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> But because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, on the other hand, have clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, that position public. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so hellauf begeistert of Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult for Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other to agree? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead pushing things out of their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> do precisely with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> This is, of course, not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as a major global player - Germany wants to assume a major role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is Germany the lead still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used to it, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it difficult to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time Germany will assume a greater role, verschiedenste anti-deutsche feelings freely. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This makes it the German not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from, the EU not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply need to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen szabo is Deputy Director of the transatlantic Academy, an Institute in Washington, in which academics and policy experts came from Europe and North America to the challenges of the transatlantic community forschen together. </seg>

<seg id="1677"> Simplified, it means that any application on average 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros. </seg>

<seg id="2058"> &quot;My Government is strongly committed to reduce the violence,&quot; said pena held earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, was pena held as Governor of his heimatstaats Mexico tätig. </seg>

<seg id="2081"> The critics pena nietos are of the opinion that he at least is not adequately addressed the problem of murders during his term. </seg>

<seg id="2093"> If President pena held on Saturday the präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to deal with this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as President, he is as he was as Governor,&quot; says the pri-kongressabgeordnete olvera in Valle del bravo. </seg>

<seg id="2145"> navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as confusion in made me wide. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: one for &quot;de&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;extranjeros&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in zentralkalifornien and was my whole life &quot;Mexicans&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic kürzel - just as my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or call my friends in New York &quot;Italians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I opted for &quot;mexikanisch-amerikanisch.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in my grandfather&apos;s home there was no need for kürzeln or hyphens,. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, at least good enough to get me into this language on both ends of an interview to say. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment this week after, when the future Mexican President Enrique pena nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were all those issues, which we expected, when the heads of these two countries meeting: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> pena held was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans now as high likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would like to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc to model of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And pena nieto vowed to continue the Mexico&apos;s war against the drug cartels, even if he mentioned no details on this. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of ressentiment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single idea in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced to leave you more than half its territory by vorgehaltenem rifle to the leadership of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, in centuries and not think in minutes, are memories of this event not to miss. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a us-regierungsbeamter even mildeste criticism of Mexico is, we hear - and among the elite of the country - in the Mexican press complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour bedrängen. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children montezumas proceeded on the kriegspfad. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet is the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> want to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. people, for the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or großelternteil - who got offered no chance in Mexico and towards the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is you. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may now have visited the American dream life, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> It is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a memorial a humiliating defeat and look down upon us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>

<seg id="2183"> arguing that our existence is a symbol of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families not in Mexico failed, they would not be gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not now see caught behind the seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in the United States as a child einwanderte, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take them this evil. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While American citizen is, sees you as part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the bildungsbürgertums would resume their ties to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> You want to Mexican Americans as a provisional &quot;Ambassador&quot; for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injured feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I fear, because you alone by, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to make the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans a resentment for, as have their family members were only treated not so long ago. </seg>

<seg id="2205"> Old fighting, New Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The truce between Israel and Hamas could prove unexpected foundation for the Peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual recriminations were zahllose buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and embarked on the Holy City of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in its historic conflict, is changing the Middle East around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find the end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> won a war that neither lost nor is </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance seems optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21\ xC2 November continues, have strengthened the dieswöchigen kämpfe the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group had to even large loss. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas killed and 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten eingepfercht corners of the planet, it is Israel until now have not been able to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, added Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate palästinensergruppe Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas could conclude that you have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken for the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most powerful Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> jubelnde hamas-anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent is - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren prägung stürzung Bashar Assad&apos;s face, to Jordan, where hamas-verbündete could threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Under President Muhammad mursi and in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - by far the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on volksansichten. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove player Hamas, even by Israel and the United States cannot be herausgedrängt. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The Israeli hardliners, however, can draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Militarily, Hamas is no longer a danger. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defence system,&quot; Iron dome,&quot; can prove has, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel is quiet can sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States unwavering in their position and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest gewalteskalationen. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the sperranlagen, in the West Bank and therefore in the body of an eventual Palestinian State hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal under international law, but continue to be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is as well. His Likud party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren allied group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this hinterlistigen Palestinians verhätscheln and handed them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you actually have control over the West Bank, they would not like their supporters in Gaza and rockets firing? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep it behind the wall in check and to punish, if you dare to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners will prevail. But the Arab Spring could make them a win in the final. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries in seats, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s verteidigungsetat is larger than of his four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments little help to repair its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> For the pragmatic President mursi with Barack Obama zusammentat, in order to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era symbolisieren. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also Israelis should long-term thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world take tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue their selbstbestimmungsrechtes deprived - a powder keg, which no doubt will one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The oppression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> bloody missions to suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years will increasingly take its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The right answer is that the vernünftigeren representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes gebiete abtritt. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope is that the cease-fire outsiders - for the near future small - granted more power to enforce this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now together with Turkey and Qatar the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to stop Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming un-beobachterstatus application. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama must also play its part, to encourage Israel to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he failed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> far away in the White House, it seems as if it were just a participation averse. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws for uniform zigarettenverpackungen treten in force </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and ill body parts on neutral Green packs, are the same for all tabakmarken </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single zigaretten- and tabakverpackungen came into force in Australia. markenlogos and Colors will be replaced by neutral, olive lid, which, moreover, with dramatic images are printed, the sick body parts and by cigarette smoke show ill babies and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the various health warnings and pictures from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, in the same small font abgedruckt. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> That leads Australia the world&apos;s strictest rules for tabakverpackungen. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government wants to deter young people from smoking by the glamorous image of the tobacco is removed. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% -iger probability, then no longer will start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can already see in children young age that you understand the message, the tobacco companies try to apply with your brand,&quot; says bundesgesundheitsministerin tanya plibersek. For example, you cited studies that have shown that children a logo with the idea of the Crown Princess associate. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has one of the lowest raucherquoten the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, consider other countries already have similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> So it was, with the laws would the black-market trade favours, which will lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;the law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott mcintyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha of zico import pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for zigarettenetuis and silikondeckeln to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with its challenge to the laws scheiterten. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and waiting for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, it is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, is the hole in the popularity of social media at exactly the population, directed to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from advertising, it banned them from acting as sportsponsoren and most dealers forced to cigarettes in shops no longer auszulegen changed. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned online advertising by local businesses and pages, but it has no influence on international sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If tobacco markets and has left only a small area to promote its products, to the Internet is not around,&quot; says becky freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, freeman brands noted a rise in reports of &quot;ordinary people&quot; were drawn up. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask the question: is this just a private person, as the great service to marlboro-zigaretten findet, having even incorporates a video - or has a marketing agency to do? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing to focus to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules - those countries at the World Trade Organisation complain about unfair handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia operates. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO ruling is expected in mid 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries, the similar verpackungsgesetze consider. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001, the fotografische warnungen vorschrieb. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Meanwhile, these extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers show trotzig. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Images does not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You simply take a stake and is the box way,&quot; says Victor El hage when buying a cigarette packet, in a photograph with a mundtumor abgedruckt is. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operator of the tabakhandels &quot;king of the pack&quot; in the centre of Sydney, says that the single verpackung have the filling his shelves more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;in the past I needed an hour to a delivery einzusortieren, now I need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes - then we would have told us, that&apos;s okay, we close,&quot; he visibly angry adds. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Time to be bored in a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful, </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iphones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and kindesentwicklungsexperten führen boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> When it comes to you, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, potentially promotes creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, we will no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So we should the boredom welcome with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> This I come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;boredom: a lively history&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Indeed, the boredom has a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The hauswände pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom actually. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that is the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea before a fokusgruppe of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as they want to experience,&quot; a satisfactory activity, but this cannot be able to &quot;define. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> boredom is different from apathy, therefore, to the effect that the person is not employed, but that would be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to &quot;disruption of the aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> boredom is therefore almost as to listen to as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that US is boring, even if we only have difficulties to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study,&quot; the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention &quot;- in English, about:&quot; The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, &quot;which was published in September in The Journal perspectives on psychological Science&quot;, Professor eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants zuhörten tape, on which a person a magazinartikel vorlas. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard a loud TV from the neighbouring region that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group had heard these sounds not at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who barely audible television heard, made to feel more bored than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding job, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says mark J. fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of guelph In Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If you prefer a monotonous work exercised - &quot;as the search for faulty products to a fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even fight by people physically remain attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;studies have shown that children who herumhampeln dürfen, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sitting still,&quot; says Professor fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly ermüdender film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people get bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a &quot;scale in the 1980s to langeweileanfälligkeit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale are statements such as &quot;many of the things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such scales, researchers found that young is more boring than girls, so Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of westflorida - particularly with regard to the need for more and greater diversity externer reize. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter haufen. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment by, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of teenagers in school were doing homework and the bored, while 23% data to be bored, if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents gave, to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom increase or decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He was sure, however, that &quot;the youth is seen as particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on your alltagsablauf. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> back to my ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - the studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;with the boredom to the brain a saying that we should do something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain do not always know what you should do it best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and to cook, will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can provide glücksgefühle in the short term, but these verflüchtigen long-term again. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So who&apos;s bored child an iPad is enough, but they can turn it off the boredom. It has not learned to talk or to control themselves, says Professor fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;selbstkontrolle transfers from one situation to the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to entertain, but also receives more selbstkontrolle in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should boredom celebrate. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not see too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to us off the permanent aktivitäts- and technologieberieselung wohlzufühlen. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds so as to be more boring to us. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people in truth only look for a way to shut down and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to beschäftigen, once the noise is silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marihuanagesetz </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-jährige Community college-student footballer Anthony orozco atbilstošs sdosten colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marihuanabrocken and a pipe that they smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> According to orozco, he and some friends on a septembertag travelling by car in lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was orozco for the possession of drugs and drogenutensilien vorgeladen - kavaliersdelikte, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a gerichtstermin. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; so orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drogendelikte less from the law, as the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences that will turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police no longer pursue adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts colorados have announced that existing marihuanadelikte weiterzuverfolgen quote and people are still in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time are voting on it several cities, from the suburbs denvers to the western mountains, new, state licensed marihuanageschäfte to stop at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;this situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. oates, chief of police in aurora, which lies east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in Washington State kratzen perplexed at the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a guide on the establishment of a lizenzsystems for production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline until 1 December 2013 in mind. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado is ahead in any case, most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only the drug for medical purposes and then the eigenkonsum legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for guidance,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, which we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called i-502, enters into force on 6 December and this is also the conclusion of a grey area, in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant praxisfragen must be resolved in this time - for example, how the government target of a &quot;fair access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres to schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the conurbation of Seattle,&quot; says Ben livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, &quot;a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, chief oates sent his staff in aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the Public Prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years, and that the police will pursue &quot;immediately&quot; no strafanzeigen for these offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban vorgaben to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to pursue. </seg>

<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the Member States of the UNASUR forward. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;the free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors, seeking a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>

<seg id="2746"> The lessons, undertake never to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington, and is funded by the United States,&quot; he said in reference to the political asylum, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted the Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he does not regret this decision, because he was so as not to betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights&quot; has fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it was &quot;reasonable suspicions have given that Assange be delivered to a third country and procedures would not observed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish prosecutors have demanded of him, to give him an interrogation on its territory because of alleged sexualdelikts, while &quot;the Swedish legislation allows this via a video conference, which could have been carried out on the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;since he is in our message is, I have not spoken to him, the Ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,&quot; said the head of state in Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> However, there is a danger that he take physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;that would affect the health of every people,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of a freibriefs is, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that Europe&apos;s lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, we are this word in this case not to, there have been constant discussions, however. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various European bodies leads,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain this licence granted tomorrow, I believe that this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype verhörte, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he can tolerate,&quot; the mediocrity, not the evil intention and dispel the lie, the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In that sense it beglückwünschte that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists&apos;, and not by the bankers or hegemonischen and spießbürgerlichen countries,&quot; and took vorweg that he is in a re-election &quot;will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least up to the next elections, and he argued that the body &quot;must be hard and not opportunism and not as legal verkleideten coup stattgeben darf,&quot; because it &quot;the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte to negotiate with Nicaragua seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, for &quot;absolutely right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Currently this judgment is not being implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South and Central American state. </seg>
